                         PROXIES AND VOTING INFORMATION

Solicitation of Proxies

This proxy statement is furnished by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of
Kraft Foods Inc. (the "Company"), Three Lakes Drive, Northfield, Illinois 60093,
in connection with its solicitation of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders to be held on Monday, April 22, 2002, at 9:00 a.m., at the Kraft
Foods Inc. Robert M. Schaeberle Technology Center, 200 DeForest Avenue, East
Hanover, New Jersey, and at any and all adjournments thereof. Mailing of the
proxy statement will commence on or about March 8, 2002. Holders of record of
the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (collectively, the
"Common Stock") at the close of business on March 5, 2002, will be entitled to
vote on all matters to come before the meeting. Holders of Class A Common Stock
will be entitled to one vote for each share held. As of March 5, 2002, there
were outstanding 555,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of which 275,000,000
were held by Philip Morris Companies Inc. ("Philip Morris"). Holders of Class B
Common Stock will be entitled to ten votes for each share held. As of March 5,
2002, there were outstanding 1,180,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, all
of which were held by Philip Morris.

Stockholders are urged to sign and date the enclosed proxy and return it as
promptly as possible in the envelope enclosed for that purpose. Registered
stockholders can also deliver proxies by calling a toll-free telephone number or
by using the Internet. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed
to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to give their
voting instructions and to confirm that stockholders' instructions have been
recorded properly. Instructions for voting by telephone or over the Internet are
set forth on the enclosed proxy card. Most stockholders whose shares are held by
a broker or other nominee are also afforded the opportunity to vote by telephone
or over the Internet. Instructions are set forth on the enclosed proxy.

A proxy may be revoked at any time before it has been voted at the meeting by
submitting a later-dated proxy (including a proxy by telephone or over the
Internet) or by giving written notice to the Secretary of the Company. Unless
the proxy is revoked or there is a direction to abstain on one or more
proposals, it will be voted on each proposal and, if a choice is made with
respect to any matter to be acted upon, in accordance with such choice. If no
choice is specified, the proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board. The
proxy will also serve to instruct the trustee of each defined contribution plan
sponsored by the Company how to vote the plan shares of a participating
stockholder or employee. The trustee of each defined contribution plan will vote
the plan shares for which proxies are not received in the same proportion as the
shares for which proxies are received.

Voting at the Meeting

A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on matters to be considered at the
meeting constitutes a quorum. If a share is represented for any purpose at the
meeting, it is deemed to be present for all other matters. Abstentions and
shares held of record by a broker or its nominee ("Broker Shares") that are
voted on any matter are included in determining the number of votes present.
Broker Shares that are not voted on any matter at the meeting will not be
included in determining whether a quorum is present.

The election of each nominee for director requires a plurality of the votes
cast. In order to be approved, the votes cast for the selection of independent
accountants and approval of the compensation plan must exceed the votes cast
against such matters. Abstentions and Broker Shares that are not voted on the
matter will not be included in determining the number of votes cast. Philip
Morris has advised the Company that it intends to vote for each of the nine
nominees for director, for the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
independent accountants and for the 2001 Performance Incentive Plan.

Stockholders' proxies are received by the Company's independent proxy processing
agent, and the vote is certified by independent inspectors of election. Proxies
and ballots that identify the vote of individual stockholders will be kept
confidential, except as necessary to meet legal requirements, in cases where
stockholders write comments on their proxy cards or in a contested proxy
solicitation. During the proxy solicitation period, the Company will receive
vote tallies from time to time from the inspectors, but such tallies will
provide aggregate figures rather than names of stockholders. The independent
inspectors will notify the Company if a stockholder has failed to vote so that
he or she may be reminded and requested to do so.

                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

Director Nominations Controlled by Philip Morris

Under the terms of a corporate agreement entered into between the Company and
Philip Morris, so long as Philip Morris owns shares representing 50% or more of
the voting power of the Company's outstanding Common Stock, Philip Morris has
the right to designate for nomination by the Board three members of the Board,
including the Chairman of the Board. Philip Morris also has the right to fill
any vacancy resulting from a Philip Morris designee ceasing to serve on the
Board. Philip Morris' designees on the Board are currently Mr. Bible, Mr.
Camilleri and Mr. Webb.

General Information

The Board has responsibility for establishing broad corporate policies and for
the overall performance of the Company, although it is not involved in
day-to-day operations. Members of the Board are kept informed of the Company's
businesses by various reports and documents sent to them, as well as by
operating and financial reports made at Board and committee meetings by the
Chairman of the Board and other officers. In addition, the Board holds an annual
two- or three-day meeting to review the Company's Five-Year Plan.

Regular meetings of the Board are held in January, March, April, June, August,
October and December and special meetings are held when necessary. The
organizational meeting follows immediately after the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. The Board held four meetings in 2001.

Committees of the Board

The Board has established two committees since the Company's initial public
offering of its Class A Common Stock on June 12, 2001.

The Board has an Audit Committee, which consists entirely of directors who are
not employees of the Company or Philip Morris. The Audit Committee members are:
Mr. Pope (chair), Mr. Farrell, Ms. Schapiro and Ms. Wright. Its
responsibilities, which include the approval of material transactions with
Philip Morris, are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter included as Exhibit
A to this proxy statement. The Audit Committee's report appears on page 6 of
this proxy statement. The Audit Committee met twice in 2001.

The Board also has a Compensation and Governance Committee, which is responsible
for administering the Company's compensation programs and remuneration
arrangements for its highest-paid executives, including the co-chief executive
officers, and for reviewing the succession plans for the chief executive
officers and other senior executives. The Compensation and Governance Committee
also recommends to the Board a slate of nominees for election as directors, and
makes recommendations with respect to general board practices and corporate
governance matters. The Compensation and Governance Committee's Report on
Executive Compensation appears on pages 11 to 14 of this proxy statement. The
Compensation and Governance Committee met twice in 2001. The members of the
committee are: Mr. Bible (chair), Mr. Farrell, Mr. Pope, Ms. Schapiro and Ms.
Wright.

The Nominees

It is proposed that nine directors, four of whom are non-employee directors, be
elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until
their successors have been elected, except for Mr. Bible and Mr. Webb, who will
retire from Philip Morris and step down from the Board in August 2002, at which
time two directors designated by Philip Morris will replace Mr. Bible and Mr.
Webb on the Board. The Board has approved the persons named below as
management's nominees and unless otherwise marked, a proxy will be voted for
such person. Each of the nominees currently serves as a director. All nominees
who served during 2001 attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings
of the Board and all committees of the Board on which they served.
                                        2
<PAGE>

Although management does not anticipate that any of the persons named below will
be unable or unwilling to stand for election, a proxy, in the event of such an
occurrence, may be voted for a substitute designated by the Board. However, in
lieu of designating a substitute, the Board may amend the Company's By-Laws to
reduce the number of directors.

Compensation of Directors

Directors who are full-time employees of the Company or Philip Morris receive no
additional compensation for services as a director. With respect to non-employee
directors, the Company's philosophy is to provide competitive compensation and
benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality non-employee directors and
to encourage ownership of Company stock to further align their interests with
those of stockholders.

Pursuant to the Company's 2001 Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the
"Directors Plan"), non-employee directors receive an annual retainer of $35,000
and fees of $1,000 for each Board meeting attended and $1,000 for each committee
meeting attended. For additional services rendered in connection with committee
chair responsibilities, the chair of the Audit Committee receives a $5,000
annual retainer.

In 2001, pursuant to the Directors Plan, each non-employee director received a
share distribution equal to that number of shares of Class A Common Stock having
an aggregate fair market value of $30,000 on the date of grant as well as an
option to purchase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock calculated by
dividing $30,000 by the Black-Scholes value of each such option. These options
have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Class A Common
Stock on the date of grant and a term of ten years. Mr. Pope, Ms. Schapiro and
Ms. Wright received 983 shares of Class A Common Stock and options to purchase
2,285 shares of Class A Common Stock on July 12, 2001, and Mr. Farrell received
933 shares of Class A Common Stock and an option to purchase 2,090 shares of
Class A Common Stock on August 28, 2001.

A non-employee director may elect to defer the award of shares of Class A Common
Stock, meeting fees and all or part of the annual retainer. Deferred fee amounts
are "credited" to an unfunded account and may be "invested" in nine "investment
choices," including a Class A Common Stock equivalent account. These "investment
choices" parallel the investment options offered to employees under the Kraft
Foods Thrift Plan and determine the "earnings" that are credited for bookkeeping
purposes to a director's account. Subject to certain restrictions, a director is
permitted to take cash distributions, in whole or in part, from his or her
account either prior to or following termination of service.

                            AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS

Upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee and in compliance with
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board has adopted an Audit
Committee Charter setting forth the requirements for the composition of the
Audit Committee, the qualifications of its members, the frequency of meetings
(including the need for meetings in executive session) and the responsibilities
of the Audit Committee.

In addition, in accordance with regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Audit Committee has issued the following report.
                                        5

Audit Committee Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2001

To Our Stockholders:

Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the
reporting process, including the systems of internal control. On behalf of the
Board of Directors, the Audit Committee monitors the Company's financial
reporting processes and systems of internal control, the independence and
performance of the independent accountants, and the performance of the internal
auditors.

Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's
consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and the Audit Committee has
reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and
the independent accountants. The Audit Committee has discussed with the
independent accountants their evaluation of the accounting principles, practices
and judgments applied by management, and the Committee has discussed any items
required to be communicated to it by the independent accountants in accordance
with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. The Audit Committee membership complies with the requirements of
the New York Stock Exchange with respect to independence, financial literacy and
financial management expertise, but its members are not professionally engaged
in the practice of accounting and are not experts in the fields of accounting or
auditing.

The Audit Committee has received from the independent accountants a letter
describing any relationships with the Company that may bear on their
independence and has discussed with the independent accountants the accountants'
independence from the Company and its management. The Committee has reviewed the
audit fees of the independent accountants. It has also reviewed non-audit
services and fees to assure compliance with the Company's and the Committee's
policies restricting the independent accountants from performing services that
might impair their independence.

The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditors and
independent accountants the overall scope of and plans for their respective
audits. The Committee has met with the internal auditors and the independent
accountants, separately and together, with and without management present, to
discuss the Company's financial reporting processes and internal controls. The
Committee has reviewed significant audit findings presented by the independent
accountants and those prepared by the internal auditors, together with
management's responses.

In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and without other
independent verification, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of
Directors the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Audit Committee:

John C. Pope, Chair
W. James Farrell
Mary L. Schapiro
Deborah C. Wright

The information contained in the report above shall not be deemed to be
"soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company
specifically incorporates it by reference in such filing.

Independent Accountants' Fees

Audit Fees

Aggregate fees, including out-of-pocket expenses, for professional services
rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") in connection
with (i) the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2001, including statutory audits of the
financial statements of the Company's affiliates that are relied on in
performance of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements, and
(ii) the limited reviews of the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements as of September 30, 2001, June 30, 2001, and March
31, 2001 were $9.3 million.

Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees

During the year ended December 31, 2001, PricewaterhouseCoopers rendered no
professional services to the Company in connection with the design and
implementation of financial information systems.

All Other Fees

In addition to the fees described above, aggregate fees, including out-of-pocket
expenses, of $7.5 million were paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers during the year
ended December 31, 2001, primarily for the following professional services:
tax-related services ($2.5 million); due diligence for acquisitions ($2.7
million); and other audit services ($2.3 million). Other audit services consist
primarily of services relating to the Company's initial public offering of its
Class A Common Stock, audits of the Company's employee benefit plans, accounting
for the acquisition of Nabisco Holdings Corp., and various other audit reports
issued by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

                      SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

Upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee and subject to stockholder
approval, the Board has retained PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company's
independent accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. In
recommending to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers be retained as the
Company's independent accountants, the Audit Committee considered whether the
provision of non-audit services by PricewaterhouseCoopers was compatible with
maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence and concluded that it was. A
representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers will be present at the meeting. The
representative will be given an opportunity to make a statement if he or she
desires to do so.

The Board recommends a vote FOR the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Compensation and Governance Committee Report on Executive Compensation

To Our Stockholders:

This report discusses the Company's compensation programs for executive officers
and details of the compensation paid to the Company's Co-Chief Executive
Officers for 2001.

The Company's compensation programs have four primary goals:

- -  attract, motivate, retain and develop talented employees and world-class
   leaders;

- -  support the Company's mission of becoming the undisputed global food leader;

- -  emphasize the relationship between pay and performance by aligning
   compensation programs to the achievement of short-term and long-term
   financial and strategic objectives; and

- -  align the interests of executives with those of stockholders.

For purposes of benchmarking market practice with respect to compensation paid
to its executive officers, the Committee compares the Company's compensation
practices to the compensation practices of a compensation survey group. The
Company's compensation survey group is made up of companies:

- -  in similar lines of business, i.e., food products and other consumer
   products;

- -  with similar levels of management complexity and global focus;

- -  with similar revenue and market capitalization levels;

- -  recognized for their industry and brand leadership; and

- -  with whom the Company competes for key employees.

The Company's compensation survey group is a somewhat broader and more diverse
group of companies than those included in the peer group index used in the
cumulative stockholder return graph on page 10 of this proxy statement.

2001 was a significant year for the Company. The integration of Nabisco Holdings
Corp., which was acquired at the end of 2000, continued on schedule; top-line
growth was driven by innovation and further expansion in developing markets; and
strong productivity savings were delivered. Importantly, the Company
successfully completed the initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock
(the "IPO").

The Committee considers the following in setting compensation levels for
executives:

- -  Company and business, financial, portfolio and strategic performance versus
   both pre-determined performance goals and the performance of companies in the
   compensation survey group;

- -  individual contributions to the Company's performance;

- -  management and financial controls;

- -  compensation levels set by companies within the compensation survey group;
   and

- -  the Company's size and complexity compared with companies in the compensation
   survey group.

The Committee generally targets total compensation for executives at the 75th
percentile, if business and individual performance targets are met. This allows
the Company to attract, retain and motivate the caliber of executives needed to
drive superior business performance and to create consistently superior
shareholder return. In 2001, total compensation for executives ranked within the
top quartile of the compensation survey group, based on the latest available
data.

                                        11
<PAGE>

There are three major elements to the Company's compensation program: base
salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives.

Base Salary

The Committee periodically reviews the Company's base salaries for individual
senior executives. In determining individual salaries, the Committee conducts a
qualitative evaluation of a variety of factors, including individual
performance, level of responsibility, tenure, prior experience and a comparison
of base salaries paid for comparable positions within the Company's compensation
survey group.

Annual Incentives

The Company provides annual incentive opportunities to the Company's management
and executive employees. Annual cash incentives reward participants for the
achievement of financial, business and strategic results that have a positive
impact on the Company's total return to stockholders.

In 2001, annual incentive payouts for those officers (the "covered officers")
whose compensation is subject to the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m)
of the Internal Revenue Code were contingent upon a pre-determined compensation
formula linked to the attainment of adjusted net income results as approved by
the Committee.

Actual payouts for the remaining participants were based upon a qualitative
evaluation of business performance and an assessment of individual performance.
The Committee did not assign specific weights to the performance factors
considered.

The factors used to evaluate performance comprised the financial measures of
business unit volume, income, cash flow, return on management investment, and
market share evaluated against both 2000 results and the Company's 2001 business
plan. The Committee also evaluated the Company's performance against the
strategic measures of portfolio management, diversity, leadership development
and response to the business environment.

Long-Term Incentives

The 2001 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan") enables the Company to grant
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other awards
based on Class A Common Stock, as well as performance-based long-term incentive
cash awards to the Company's salaried employees. Long-term incentives focus
executives on attaining performance goals integral to the success of the
Company's business while increasing stockholder returns.

Stock Options.  Prior to the IPO, eligible Company employees were awarded a
Philip Morris stock option grant in January 2001. The stock option grant was
awarded pursuant to either the Philip Morris 1997 Performance Incentive Plan or
the Philip Morris 2000 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Philip Morris Grant").
The Philip Morris Grant was targeted at the 55th percentile of the Philip Morris
compensation survey group. The size of actual individual stock option awards was
determined based on a qualitative evaluation of each participant's individual
performance and future potential with the Company. The Philip Morris Grants
awarded to certain senior Company executives included an Executive Ownership
Stock Option ("EOSO") feature. The EOSO feature promotes the early exercise of
stock options and the retention of shares gained through the resulting exercise,
which encourages executives to build their stock ownership. An EOSO is granted
when an eligible executive exercises an option when the stock price has
appreciated at least 20% above the option grant price, and the executive pays
the option price using shares of common stock that have been owned for at least
six months. The executive is required to hold the new net shares received upon
exercise for one year or the related EOSO grant is forfeited. The EOSO is
granted for the number of shares used to pay the exercise price of the
underlying option and related withholding taxes, has an exercise price equal to
the fair market value of the common

                                        12
<PAGE>

stock tendered, has a term limited to the remaining term of the original option
and vests six months from the date of grant.

Also in 2001, to further align the interests of the Company's key employees with
those of the Company's stockholders following the IPO, stock option grants to
purchase shares of Class A Common Stock were authorized at the time of the IPO.
Pursuant to the Plan, eligible employees received options, which vest in full in
January 2003, to purchase Class A Common Stock. These options have an exercise
price equal to the IPO price of $31.00 per share. The options awarded to certain
senior Company executives included an EOSO feature similar to the EOSO feature
described above. In addition, pursuant to the Plan, certain senior Company
executives were awarded performance-enhanced stock option grants to purchase
Class A Common Stock. These performance-enhanced stock options also carry an
exercise price equal to the IPO price, but will vest either five years from the
grant date, or on an accelerated basis if performance hurdles are achieved.
Accelerated vesting is contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined total
stockholder return ("TSR") goals for each year of the specified performance
period. One-third of the option shares will vest each year over the first three
years, if, in each year, the pre-determined TSR goal is attained.

Long-Term Performance Awards.  Long-Term Performance Awards focus senior
executives on the achievement of long-term financial and strategic goals that
contribute to the long-term business success of the Company and have a positive
impact on stockholder return. In January 2001, a new, three-year, long-term
performance cycle commenced, with awards scheduled to be paid in the first
quarter of 2004 after the completion of the three-year cycle in 2003, provided
that certain long-term performance goals are attained. The 2001-2003 Long-Term
Performance Awards for covered officers are payable in cash, and payment is
contingent on a formula tied to the achievement of cumulative adjusted net
income. For other executives, long-term performance awards are payable in cash
based solely on a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of three-year business
performance relative to the three-year plan, beginning January 2001, along with
an assessment of individual performance. The performance factors are the
cumulative quantitative financial measures of income, discretionary cash flow,
volume, earnings per share and return on management investments, and the
strategic measures of market share, total stockholder return, portfolio
management, productivity and synergy savings, and organizational development. No
specific weights have been assigned to the factors the Committee will consider;
however, the individual performance factor will be limited to an adjustment of
plus or minus 25%.

Prior to the IPO, a limited number of Company executives participated in a
long-term incentive award program under the Philip Morris 2000 Performance
Incentive Plan. Commencing with the IPO, these executives became participants in
the Long-Term Performance Award program under the Plan.

Compensation of the Co-Chief Executive Officers

The Committee generally targets total compensation for its senior executives at
the 75th percentile of the compensation survey group. Mr. Deromedi and Ms.
Holden are each responsible for a significant portion of the business and, in
their roles as Co-Chief Executive Officers, equally share overall responsibility
for the management of the Company and its performance. Because of the Company's
Co-Chief Executive Officer structure, Mr. Deromedi's and Ms. Holden's individual
total compensation is less than the 75th percentile for a single chief executive
officer of companies in the compensation survey group.

The Committee intends to determine Mr. Deromedi's and Ms. Holden's compensation
according to the compensation plans that apply to other Company executive
officers, taking into account their contributions to the success of the Company.
For 2001, the Committee considered individual performance with respect to the
achievement of key strategic, financial and leadership development objectives,
including the successful execution of the IPO and integration of the Nabisco
Holdings Corp. businesses, income growth, productivity savings, new product
development, increasing market share and increasing free cash flow, in
determining Mr. Deromedi's and Ms. Holden's compensation.

                                        13
<PAGE>

The Committee has determined that in light of the current circumstances, Mr.
Deromedi's and Ms. Holden's compensation is appropriate as compared to the
compensation provided to a single chief executive officer in the Company's
compensation survey group.

During 2001, the Committee or, with respect to actions occurring prior to June
13, 2001, the compensation committee of the board of directors of Philip Morris,
took the following actions related to the compensation of Mr. Deromedi and Ms.
Holden:

- -  increased their base salaries in 2001 to $850,000 per year;

- -  awarded each an annual incentive award for 2001, which was contingent on a
   pre-established formula applicable to all covered officers;

- -  granted each on January 31, 2001, a non-qualified stock option to purchase
   from Philip Morris 146,480 shares of Philip Morris common stock with an
   exercise price equal to the fair market value of Philip Morris common stock
   on the date of grant, and which vested in full on January 31, 2002;

- -  granted each on June 12, 2001, a non-qualified stock option to purchase from
   the Company 209,677 shares of Class A Common Stock with an exercise price
   equal to the IPO price of $31.00 per share, which vests in full on January
   31, 2003; and

- -  granted each on June 12, 2001, a non-qualified, performance-enhanced stock
   option grant to purchase from the Company 209,677 shares of Class A Common
   Stock with terms consistent with those described on page 13.

Policy With Respect To Qualifying Compensation for Deductibility and Other
Matters

The Company's ability to deduct compensation it pays to covered officers is
generally limited, under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, to
$1,000,000 annually. However, performance-based compensation is not subject to
this limitation, provided certain conditions are satisfied. The annual and
long-term incentives the Committee awarded to covered officers in 2001 were
subject to, and made in accordance with, arrangements implemented by the
Committee to qualify for Section 162(m)'s performance-based compensation
exemption, so that such payments would be fully tax-deductible.

Generally, the Company's policy is to preserve the federal income tax
deductibility of compensation it pays. Accordingly, the Committee has taken
appropriate actions, to the extent the Committee believes feasible, to preserve
the deductibility of annual incentive, long-term performance, and stock option
awards. However, the Committee will retain the authority to authorize payments
that may not be deductible if the Committee believes that they are in the
stockholders' and the Company's best interests. Income for the Company's covered
officers may exceed the $1,000,000 deductibility limit because of certain
elements of their annual compensation, such as perquisites, certain restricted
stock awards and cash dividends thereon, payments related to reductions in
unfunded retirement benefits, tax reimbursements, and income resulting from
payments made pursuant to plans that do not discriminate in favor of executive
officers.

of December 31, 2001, in the aggregate amount of $6.7 billion, which amount is
in excess of 5% of the Company's total consolidated assets as of that date.

(2) In 2001, a limited number of senior executives received long-term
performance awards for performance covering a three-year cycle commencing
January 1, 1998, and ending December 31, 2000. The awards to the executive
officers named in this table were based upon the achievement of financial and
strategic goals over the three-year period.

(3) The amounts in this column consist of matching contributions to defined
contribution plans.

The Company has made available funding payments to certain executives with
vested accrued benefits under non-qualified supplemental retirement plans.
During 2001, the following amounts, less applicable tax withholding, were made
available to the named executive officers to provide funding for matching
contributions to the Company's non-qualified supplemental defined contribution
plan through March 31, 2001, and for earnings through June 30, 2001, on such
matching contributions for Ms. Haben and Mr. Roberts, and for matching
contributions and earnings through May 31, 2001 for Mr. Deromedi, Ms. Holden and
Ms. Rosenfeld: Mr. Deromedi, $120,675; Ms. Holden, $163,791; Ms. Rosenfeld,
$93,746; Ms. Haben, $115,339; and Mr. Roberts, $126,547. The funding of these
amounts is not intended to increase total promised benefits.

(4) Includes reimbursement for taxes on a portion of the earnings on assets held
in trust for Mr. Deromedi, Ms. Holden, Ms. Haben, Mr. Roberts and Ms. Rosenfeld.
These trust assets offset amounts otherwise payable by the Company for vested
benefits under non-qualified supplemental retirement plans and are not intended
to increase total promised benefits.

Holden of 11,726 shares and Ms. Rosenfeld of 12,595 shares. EOSOs do not become

if the executive does not hold the net option shares received upon exercise for
a period of one year following such exercise of the underlying options.

(1) In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, grant date
present value is determined using the Black-Scholes Model. The Black-Scholes
Model is a complicated mathematical formula widely used to value exchange-traded
options. However, stock options granted by the Company and Philip Morris are
long-term, non-transferable and subject to vesting restrictions, while
exchange-traded options are short-term and can be exercised or sold immediately
in a liquid market. The Black-Scholes Model relies on several key assumptions to
estimate the present value of options, including the volatility of, and dividend
yield on, the security underlying the option, the risk-free rate of return on
the date of grant, and the estimated time period until exercise of the option.
In calculating the grant date present values set forth in the table, the
volatility was based on the monthly closing stock prices and dividends for the
five-year period preceding the grant dates for the Philip Morris stock option
grants and based on the average volatility for companies in the Company's
compensation survey group for the Company's stock option grants, the dividend
yield was based on an annual dividend rate in effect at the time the options
were granted, the risk-free rate of return was fixed at the rate for a five-year
U.S. Treasury Note for the month of grant as reported in the Federal Reserve
Statistic Release H.15(159), and an estimated time period equal to the lesser of
the option term or five years was used. The following assumptions were used in
the table:

The use of different assumptions can produce significantly different estimates
of the present value of options. Consequently, the grant date present values
shown in the table are only theoretical values and may not accurately represent
present value. The actual value, if any, an optionee will realize will depend on
the excess of market value of Philip Morris common stock or Class A Common
Stock, as the case may be, over the exercise price on the date the option is
exercised.

(2) Based on the closing price of Philip Morris common stock of $45.85 or Class
A Common Stock of $34.03, as the case may be, on December 31, 2001.

(3) Stock option grants made as part of the Philip Morris 2001 annual stock
option grant in January 2001, prior to the IPO. Options are not exercisable
until one year following the grant date. Percentage of total options granted to
employees in fiscal year refers to all options, including reload options granted
through the EOSO program, to purchase Philip Morris common stock granted by
Philip Morris to its employees and employees of its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries.

(4) These options to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock are not exercisable
until January 31, 2003. Percentage of total options granted to employees in
fiscal year refers to all employee stock options to purchase Class A Common
Stock granted by the Company to its employees and employees of its wholly-owned
and majority-owned subsidiaries.

(5) These options are performance-enhanced and are exercisable based on the
achievement of total stockholder return goals for the Class A Common Stock
during the three years following June 12, 2001, the date of grant. Any
performance-enhanced options not exercisable during three years following the
date of grant will become exercisable five years from the date of grant.
Percentage of total options granted to employees in fiscal year refers to all
employee stock options to purchase Class A Common Stock granted by the Company
to its employees and employees of its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries.

(6) Represents Philip Morris EOSOs that do not become exercisable until six
months following their date of grant. EOSO grants are subject to forfeiture if
the executive does not hold the net option shares received upon exercise for a
period of one year following such exercise of the underlying options. Percentage
of total options granted to employees in fiscal year refers to all options,
including reload options granted through the EOSO program, to purchase Philip
Morris common stock granted by Philip Morris to its employees and employees of
its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.

cycle commencing on January 1, 2001 and ending on December 31, 2003.

(2) The target award opportunities are expressed as a percentage of total cash
compensation. As future payments are based on three-year total cash
compensation, the amount of the target award is not presently determinable.
However, an estimate is provided based on the assumption that the annual base
salary as of December 31, 2001 and annual bonus earned in 2001 are earned in

(1) At February 1, 2002, Mr. Deromedi had accredited service of 13.7 years; Ms.
Holden had accredited service of 17.7 years; Ms. Rosenfeld had accredited
service of 20.9 years; Ms. Haben had accredited service of 22.7 years; and Mr.
Roberts had accredited service of 26.7 years.

Mr. Deromedi, Ms. Holden, Ms. Rosenfeld, Ms. Haben and Mr. Roberts participate
in the tax-qualified Kraft Foods Retirement Plan and a non-qualified
supplemental pension plan (collectively, the "Kraft Foods Retirement Plan").
These plans provide for fixed retirement benefits in relation to the
participant's years of accredited service, five-year average annual compensation
(the highest average annual compensation during any period of five full
consecutive years out of the ten years preceding retirement) and applicable
Social Security-covered compensation amount. The fixed retirement benefit is
also dependent upon the periods of service before January 1, 1989 (for former
Kraft Foods participants), or

                                        19
<PAGE>

January 1, 1991 (for former General Foods participants), in which the
participant elected to make contributions. Allowances are payable upon
retirement at the normal retirement age of 65 and upon attainment of certain
conditions at earlier ages. Annual compensation includes the amount shown as
salary and bonus in the Summary Compensation Table. At December 31, 2001,
five-year average annual compensation was $976,270 for Mr. Deromedi; $742,708
for Ms. Holden; $627,377 for Ms. Rosenfeld; $563,719 for Ms. Haben; and $580,404
for Mr. Roberts.

The above table provides examples of annual pension benefits payable under the
Kraft Foods Retirement Plan. The examples, which assume retirement at the normal
retirement age of 65, are based on the Social Security-covered compensation
amount in effect for an employee attaining age 65 in calendar year 2002. Since
participant contributions could be substantial in individual cases, the benefit
amounts shown in the table may be attributed in certain instances to participant
contributions to a significant degree, depending upon retirement date and years
of service. The Company has made available funding payments to certain
executives with vested accrued benefits under non-qualified supplemental
retirement plans. During 2001, the following amounts, less applicable tax
withholding, were made available to the following executive officers named in
the Summary Compensation Table to provide funding for pension benefits earned
under the Company's non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan as of
December 31, 2000, and valued at July 1, 2001 for Ms. Haben and Mr. Roberts, and
for projected benefits to be earned through July 1, 2002 and valued at July 1,
2001 for Mr. Deromedi, Ms. Holden and Ms. Rosenfeld: Mr. Deromedi, $148,272; Ms.
Holden, $327,415; Ms. Rosenfeld, $685,354; Ms. Haben, $267,278; and Mr. Roberts,
$174,246. These amounts offset benefits previously accrued and do not increase
total promised benefits.

Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change of Control
Arrangements

Mr. Deromedi and Ms. Holden have change of control agreements with Philip
Morris. The agreements provide that if the executive is terminated other than
for cause within three years after a change of control of Philip Morris or if
the executive terminates his or her employment for good reason within such
three-year period or voluntarily during the thirty-day period following the
first anniversary of the change of control, the executive is entitled to receive
a lump-sum severance payment equal to two and one-half times the sum of base
salary and highest annual bonus, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of months remaining until the expiration of the three-year period (but
which shall be no greater than 30), and the denominator of which is 30, together
with certain other payments and benefits, including continuation of employee
welfare benefits. An additional payment is required to compensate the executive
in the event excise taxes are imposed upon payments under the agreements.

                        2001 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN

Introduction

Prior to the IPO, the Board and Philip Morris, as the former sole stockholder of
the Company, adopted the 2001 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The
prospectus for the IPO disclosed the material terms of the Plan. Because the
Company is now publicly traded, the Plan is being submitted to all stockholders
with a request for approval. A copy of the Plan is attached as Exhibit B to this
proxy statement.

Assuming that the Plan is approved by the Company's stockholders, it will
continue to permit the Company to grant to salaried employees awards of stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other awards based on
the Class A Common Stock, as well as performance-based annual and long-term
incentive awards. Your Board believes that the Plan forms an important part of
the Company's overall compensation program. The Plan supports the Company's
ongoing efforts to develop and retain world-class leaders and gives the Company
the ability to provide those employees with

                                        20
<PAGE>

incentives that are directly linked to the profitability of the Company's
businesses and increases in stockholder value.

Summary of the Plan

The following general description of certain features of the Plan is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Plan set forth as Exhibit
B.

Eligibility and Limits on Awards.  Salaried employees of the Company, its
subsidiaries and its affiliates, who are responsible for or contribute to the
management, growth and profitability of the Company, its subsidiaries and
affiliates, will be eligible to receive awards under the Plan. Employees of
Philip Morris and its subsidiaries other than the Company and its subsidiaries
are not eligible for awards. Approximately 2,835 employees currently participate
in the Plan, including 25 officers.

Under the Plan, no employee may receive awards of stock options and stock
appreciation rights ("SARs") that total more than 7,500,000 shares in any Plan
year. The value of an employee's annual incentive award may not exceed
$7,500,000; and individual long-term incentive awards are limited to 150,000
shares times the number of years in the applicable performance cycle and, in the
case of awards expressed in U.S. currency, $4,500,000 times the number of years
in the applicable performance cycle.

Administration.  The Compensation and Governance Committee administers the Plan.
The Committee selects the eligible employees to receive grants and sets the
terms of awards, including any performance goals applicable to annual and
long-term incentive awards. The Committee has the authority to permit or require
the deferral of payment of awards. The Committee may delegate its authority
under the Plan to officers of the Company, subject to guidelines, for employees
who are not "executive officers" of the Company.

Shares Reserved for Awards.  The number of shares of Class A Common Stock
reserved and available for awards under the Plan is 75,000,000. If any award
under the Plan is exercised or cashed out or terminates or expires or is
forfeited without payment being made in the form of Class A Common Stock, the
shares subject to such award will again be available for distribution under the
Plan, as will shares that are used by an employee to pay withholding taxes or as
payment for the exercise price of an award. No more than 18,800,000 of the
shares issuable under the Plan may be awarded as restricted stock or pursuant to
incentive awards or "other stock-based awards" (as discussed on page 22 and
excluding from this limitation such awards whose value is based solely on the
appreciation in fair market value of the Class A Common Stock from the grant or
exercise price of the award). Stock options may be exercised by tendering Class
A Common Stock to the Company in full or partial payment of the exercise price.

In the event of any transaction or event that affects Class A Common Stock,
including but not limited to a merger, share exchange, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, distribution, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, split-up, spin-off or issuance of rights or warrants, then
the Board is authorized, to the extent it deems appropriate, to make
substitutions or adjustments in the number and kind of shares reserved for
issuance under the Plan, in the number, kind and price of shares subject to
outstanding awards under the Plan and in the limits on individual awards
described above or to provide for cash payments to the holders of such awards.
The Compensation and Governance Committee also may make awards in substitution
for awards held by individuals who become employees of the Company, a subsidiary
or an affiliate in connection with any such transactions. Notwithstanding the
generally applicable provisions of the Plan, such substituted awards may be on
such terms as the Committee determines is appropriate.

Annual and Long-Term Incentive Awards.  Annual and long-term incentive awards
may be granted under the Plan. These awards will be earned only if corporate,
business unit or individual performance

                                        21
<PAGE>

objectives over performance cycles established by or under the direction of the
Compensation and Governance Committee are met. The performance objectives may
vary from employee to employee, group to group and period to period. The
performance objectives for awards that are intended to constitute "qualified
performance-based compensation" (see discussion below under the heading United
States Federal Income Tax Consequences) will be based upon one or more of the
following: earnings per share, total shareholder return, operating companies
income, net income, cash flow, return on equity, return on capital or economic
value added (i.e., net after-tax operating profit less the cost of capital).
Awards may be paid in the form of cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or in any
combination, as determined by the Committee.

Stock Options.  The Plan permits the granting to eligible employees of incentive
stock options ("ISOs"), which qualify for special tax treatment, and
nonqualified stock options. The option grants may include executive ownership
stock options (see description on page 12) to an eligible employee who tenders
mature shares of Class A Common Stock already owned by the employee for at least
six months to pay all or a portion of the exercise price of a stock option
and/or to cover minimum-required withholding tax liabilities, including Social
Security and Medicare, resulting from the exercise of the stock option. An
executive ownership stock option will entitle the employee to acquire shares of
Class A Common Stock equal to the number of mature shares tendered to pay the
exercise price and/or withholding tax liabilities. The exercise price for any
stock option will not be less than the fair market value of Class A Common Stock
on the date of grant.

SARs.  SARs may also be granted either singly or in combination with underlying
stock options. SARs entitle the holder upon exercise to receive an amount in any
combination of cash or shares of Class A Common Stock (as determined by the
Compensation and Governance Committee) equal in value to the excess of the fair
market value of the shares covered by such right over the grant price. The grant
price for SARs will not be less than the fair market value of the Class A Common
Stock on the date of grant.

Restricted Stock.  Shares of restricted Class A Common Stock may also be
awarded. The restricted stock will vest and become transferable upon the
satisfaction of conditions set forth in the restricted stock award agreement.
Restricted stock awards may be forfeited if, for example, the recipient's
employment terminates before the award vests. Except as specified in the
restricted stock award agreement, the holder of a restricted stock award will
have all the rights of a holder of Class A Common Stock on his or her restricted
shares.

Other Stock-Based Awards.  The Plan also provides for awards that are
denominated in, valued by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to,
Class A Common Stock. These awards may include, without limitation, performance
shares and restricted stock units that entitle the recipient to receive, upon
satisfaction of performance goals or other conditions, a specified number of
shares of Class A Common Stock or the cash equivalent thereof. When the value of
such stock-based award is based on the difference between the fair market value
of the shares covered by such award and the exercise price, the grant price for
the award will not be less than the fair market value of Class A Common Stock on
the date of grant.

Change in Control Provisions.  The Plan provides that, in the event of a "Change
in Control" (as defined in the Plan), all stock options and SARs will become
fully vested and immediately exercisable, the restrictions applicable to
outstanding restricted stock and other stock-based awards will lapse, and,
unless otherwise determined by the Compensation and Governance Committee, the
value of outstanding stock options, SARs, restricted stock and other stock-based
awards will be cashed out on the basis of the highest price per share paid in
any transaction reported on the New York Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions
or paid or offered in any bona fide transaction related to a potential or actual
change in control of the Company during the preceding 60-day period. In
addition, outstanding incentive awards will be vested and paid out on a prorated
basis, based on the maximum award opportunity of

                                        22
<PAGE>

such awards and the number of months elapsed compared with the total number of
months in the performance cycle.

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences

Nonqualified Stock Options.  Nonqualified stock options granted under the Plan
will not be taxable to an employee at grant but generally will result in
taxation at exercise, at which time the employee will recognize ordinary income
in an amount equal to the difference between the option's exercise price and the
fair market value of the shares on the exercise date. The Company will be
entitled to deduct a corresponding amount as a business expense in the year the
employee recognizes this income.

Incentive Stock Options.  An employee will generally not recognize ordinary
income on receipt or exercise of an ISO so long as he or she has been an
employee of the Company or its subsidiaries from the date the ISO was granted
until three months before the date of exercise; however, the amount by which the
fair market value of the shares on the exercise date exceeds the exercise price
is an adjustment in computing the employee's alternative minimum tax in the year
of exercise. If the employee holds the shares of Class A Common Stock received
on exercise of the ISO for one year after the date of exercise (and for two
years from the date of grant of the ISO), any difference between the amount
realized upon the disposition of the shares and the amount paid for the shares
will be treated as long-term capital gain (or loss, if applicable) to the
employee. If the employee exercises an ISO and satisfies these holding period
requirements, the Company may not deduct any amount in connection with the ISO.

If an employee exercises an ISO but engages in a "disqualifying disposition" by
selling the shares acquired on exercise before the expiration of the one and
two-year holding periods described above, the employee generally will recognize
ordinary income (for regular income tax purposes only) in the year of the
disqualifying disposition equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value
of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price; and any excess of
the amount realized on the disposition over the fair market value on the date of
exercise will be taxed as long- or short-term capital gain (as applicable). If,
however, the fair market value of the shares on the date of the disqualifying
disposition is less than on the date of exercise, the employee will recognize
ordinary income equal only to the difference between the amount realized on the
disqualifying disposition and the exercise price. In either event, the Company
will be entitled to deduct an amount equal to the amount constituting ordinary
income to the employee as a business expense in the year of the disqualifying
disposition.

SARs.  There are no immediate tax consequences to an employee when an SAR is
granted. When an employee exercises the right to the appreciation in fair market
value of shares represented by an SAR, payments made, whether in cash or stock,
are normally includable in the employee's gross income for regular income tax
purposes. The Company will be entitled to deduct the same amount as a business
expense in the same year. When payments are made in shares of Class A Common
Stock, the includable amount and corresponding deduction each equal the fair
market value of the shares on the date of exercise.

Restricted Stock.  The recognition of income from an award of restricted stock
for federal income tax purposes depends on the restrictions imposed on the
shares. Generally, taxation will be deferred until the first taxable year the
shares are no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture. At the time the
restrictions lapse, the employee will recognize ordinary income equal to the
then fair market value of the stock. The employee may, however, make an election
to include the value of the shares in gross income in the year of award despite
such restrictions. Generally, the Company will be entitled to deduct the fair
market value of the shares transferred to the employee as a business expense in
the year the employee includes the compensation in income.

Other Stock-Based Awards/Incentive Awards.  Any cash payments or the fair market
value of any Class A Common Stock or other property an employee receives in
connection with other stock-based
                                        23
<PAGE>

awards, incentive awards, or as unrestricted payments equivalent to dividends on
unfunded awards or on restricted stock are includable in income in the year
received or made available to the employee without substantial limitations or
restrictions. Generally, the Company will be entitled to deduct the amount the
employee includes in income as a business expense in the year of payment.

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a $1,000,000 annual limit on
the compensation deductible by the Company paid to certain of its executives.
The limit, however, does not apply to "qualified performance-based
compensation." Assuming stockholder approval of the Plan, the Company believes
that awards of stock options, SARs and certain other "performance-based
compensation" awards under the Plan will qualify for the performance-based
compensation exception to the deductibility limit. State tax consequences may in
some cases differ from those described above. Awards under the Plan will in some
instances be made to employees who are subject to tax in jurisdictions other
than the United States and may result in tax consequences differing from those
described above.

Other Information

No awards will be made under the Plan after June 11, 2006. Any awards granted
before June 11, 2006 may extend beyond that date. The Board may amend the Plan
at any time, provided that no such amendment will be made without stockholder
approval if approval is required under applicable law, or if the proposed
amendment would: (i) decrease the grant or exercise price of any stock option,
SAR or other stock-based award to less than fair market value on the date of
grant; or (ii) increase the number of shares that may be distributed under the
Plan. An option may not be canceled and a new option issued at a lower price as
a substitute therefor, except as may be necessary to comply with a change in
law, regulations or accounting principles of a foreign country applicable to
participants subject to the laws of such country.

The Plan provides that an award may not be transferred except in the event of
the employee's death or unless otherwise required by law. Other terms and
conditions of each award will be set forth in award agreements, which can be
amended by the Compensation and Governance Committee, provided that no such
amendment may materially and adversely affect an award without the award
recipient's consent. Awards under the Plan may earn dividends or dividend
equivalents, as determined by the Committee.

The Plan constitutes an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation.
The Plan authorizes the creation of trusts and other arrangements to facilitate
or ensure payment of the Company's obligations.

On February 28, 2002, the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange was $39.10.

Awards under the Plan.  The allocation of awards in 2002 to any one individual
or group of individuals under the Plan is not currently determinable as such
allocation is based upon future decisions to be made by the Company's
Compensation and Governance Committee in its sole discretion, subject to the
applicable provisions of the Plan. Directors who are not employees of the
Company are not eligible to participate in the Plan. For information on Plan
awards made to named executive officers, see page 17 of this proxy statement.
The following table sets forth awards that were made under the Plan to executive
officers and other employees during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.

                        RELATIONSHIP WITH PHILIP MORRIS

As of the date of this proxy statement, Philip Morris owned approximately 83.9%
of the outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock through its ownership
of 49.5% of the outstanding Class A Common Stock, and 100% of the outstanding
Class B Common Stock. Class A Common Stock has one vote per share while Class B
Common Stock has ten votes per share. Therefore, Philip Morris holds 97.7% of
the combined voting power of the outstanding Common Stock. For as long as Philip
Morris continues to own shares representing more than 50% of the combined voting
power of the Common Stock, it will be able to direct the election of all members
of the Board and exercise a controlling influence over the business and affairs
of the Company, including any determinations with respect to mergers or other
business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence
of indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other
equity securities and the payment of dividends on Common Stock.

Included below are descriptions of certain agreements, relationships and
transactions the Company has with Philip Morris. The agreements are filed as
exhibits to the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the summaries below are qualified in all respects by reference to the full
text of the exhibits.

Corporate Agreement

The Company has entered into a corporate agreement with Philip Morris under
which Philip Morris has a continuing option to purchase additional shares of
Class A Common Stock. Philip Morris may exercise the option simultaneously with
the issuance of any equity security of the Company, only to the extent necessary
to permit Philip Morris to maintain its then-existing percentage ownership of
Common Stock. This option is not exercisable upon the issuance of stock in
connection with employee compensation. The purchase price of the shares of Class
A Common Stock purchased upon any exercise of this option will be equal to the
price paid for Class A Common Stock in the related issuance if the Company
issues Class A Common Stock for cash, or the then current market price of Class
A Common Stock if the Company issues a different equity security or Class A
Common Stock for other than cash.

                                        25
<PAGE>

The corporate agreement provides that all material intercompany transactions,
including any material amendments to the corporate agreement, the services
agreement, the tax sharing agreement or any other agreement between the Company
and Philip Morris, will be subject to the approval of the Audit Committee of the
Board.

The Company has agreed with Philip Morris that both it and Philip Morris have
the right to engage in the same or similar business activities as the other
party, do business with any customer or client of the other party, and employ or
engage any officer or employee of the other party. Neither Philip Morris nor the
Company, nor their respective related persons, will be liable to the other as a
result of engaging in any of these activities.

Under the corporate agreement, the Company must obtain Philip Morris' written
consent before: entering into any agreement binding Philip Morris or that
contains provisions that trigger a default or require a material payment when
Philip Morris exercises its rights to convert Class B Common Stock; declaring
extraordinary dividends; and issuing any equity securities except for Class A
Common Stock issued or granted to the Company's employees.

The corporate agreement will terminate when Philip Morris owns less than 50% of
the Company's then outstanding Common Stock, except that the indemnification
provisions will survive the termination.

Services Agreement

Philip Morris Management Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip Morris,
provides certain services to the Company for fees based on costs incurred by
Philip Morris and its subsidiaries in providing the services and a management
fee. In 2001, the Company paid $339 million for these services and the Company
expects to make comparable payments to Philip Morris Management Corp. for
similar levels of services in 2002. The Company believes the terms of these
services in the aggregate are at least as favorable to it as those the Company
could have obtained from unrelated third parties through arm's-length
negotiations. These services, which are the subject of a services agreement,
include government and corporate affairs services, human resources services,
treasury services, including insurance services, financial, reporting, research
and ledger services, internal auditing services, information technology
services, legal and corporate secretary services, aviation, building and
conference services, tax services, corporate planning and analysis services,
corporate business development services, and financial communications and
investor relations services.

Philip Morris Management Corp. and the Company may each terminate any or all of
the services under the services agreement by giving the other party written
notice at least 12 months in advance of termination. Philip Morris Management
Corp. has agreed to provide the Company with reasonable assistance to make an
orderly transition to other service providers upon the termination of the
services agreement.

Tax-Sharing Agreement

The Company is included in Philip Morris' federal consolidated income tax group,
and its federal income tax liability is included in the consolidated federal
income tax liability of Philip Morris and its subsidiaries. In certain
circumstances, certain of the Company's subsidiaries will also be included with
certain Philip Morris subsidiaries in combined, consolidated or unitary income
tax groups for state and local income tax purposes. The Company has entered into
a tax-sharing agreement with Philip Morris. Under the tax-sharing agreement, the
Company makes payments to Philip Morris, with respect to any period, for the
amount of taxes to be paid by the Company, and these taxes are determined as
though the Company filed separate federal, state and local income tax returns as
the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations filing combined,
consolidated or unitary, as applicable, federal, state and local income tax
returns. The Company's payments to Philip Morris also include any amounts
determined by a tax authority or estimated by Philip Morris to be due as a
result of a redetermination of the tax liability of
                                        26
<PAGE>

Philip Morris arising from an audit or otherwise. The Company is reimbursed,
however, for any tax items such as foreign tax credits, net operating losses and
alternative minimum tax credits, based on the usage of the tax items by the
consolidated group.

Borrowings from Philip Morris

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had a long-term note payable to Philip
Morris of $5.0 billion and short-term borrowings due to Philip Morris of $1.7
billion. The long-term note bears interest at an annual rate of 7.00% and
matures in 2009, with no penalty for prepayment. During 2001, the Company used
the IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and expenses, of $8.4 billion
to retire a portion of an $11.0 billion long-term note payable to Philip Morris.
The remainder of this note was repaid from short-term borrowings. In 2001, the
Company also repaid a $4.0 billion long-term note payable to Philip Morris with
the net proceeds from a $4.0 billion public global bond offering. The Company
anticipates that it will continue to refinance borrowings from Philip Morris
with proceeds from external debt offerings as market conditions permit. During
2001, the Company also refinanced two long-term Swiss franc notes payable to
Philip Morris in an aggregate amount of $1.4 billion with short-term Swiss franc
borrowings from Philip Morris at variable interest rates.

              SECTION 16 BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Based solely upon a review of copies of reports filed pursuant to Section 16(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or
written representations from persons required to file such reports, the Company
believes that all filings required to be made were timely made in accordance
with the requirements of the Exchange Act, except that Ms. Paula A. Sneed, Group
Vice President, Kraft Foods North America, Inc., failed to include on a Form 4
she filed in July 2001, an acquisition of 16 shares of Class A Common Stock by
her daughter who shares her household. When Ms. Sneed was informed of the filing
requirements with respect to that acquisition, she promptly filed a Form 5.

                                        27

                                 OTHER MATTERS

Management knows of no other business that will be presented to the meeting for
a vote. If other matters properly come before the meeting, the persons named as
proxies will vote on them in accordance with their best judgment.

The cost of this solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. In
addition to the use of the mail, some of the officers and regular employees of
the Company may solicit proxies by telephone and will request brokerage houses,
banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward soliciting
material to the beneficial owners of Class A Common Stock held of record by such
persons. The Company will reimburse such persons for expenses incurred in
forwarding such soliciting material. It is contemplated that additional
solicitation of proxies will be made in the same manner under the engagement and
direction of D.F. King & Co., Inc., 77 Water Street, New York, NY 10005, at an
anticipated cost of $6,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.

                              2003 ANNUAL MEETING

Stockholders wishing to suggest candidates to the Compensation and Governance
Committee for consideration as directors may submit names and biographical data
to the Secretary of the Company. The Company's By-Laws prescribe the procedures
a stockholder must follow to nominate directors or to bring other business
before stockholder meetings. For a stockholder to nominate a candidate for
director at the 2003 Annual Meeting, presently anticipated to be held on April
21, 2003, notice of the nomination must be received by the Company between
October 9, and November 8, 2002. The notice must describe various matters
regarding the nominee, including name, address, occupation and shares held. For
a stockholder to bring other matters before the 2003 Annual Meeting, and to
include a matter in the Company's proxy statement and proxy for that meeting,
notice must be received by the Company within the time limits described above.
The notice must include a description of the proposed business, the reasons
therefor and other specified matters. In each case, the notice must be given to
the Secretary of the Company, whose address is Three Lakes Drive, Northfield,
Illinois 60093. Any stockholder desiring a copy of the Company's By-Laws will be
furnished one without charge upon written request to the Secretary.

the Plan is exercised or cashed out or terminates or expires or is forfeited
without a payment being made to the participant in the form of Common Stock, the
shares subject to such Award, if any, shall again be available for distribution
in connection with Awards under the Plan; provided, however, that any shares

In the event of any merger, share exchange, reorganization, consolidation,

of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan, in the number, kind and
price of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding Awards and in the Award
limits set forth in Section 5 (or to make provision for cash payments to the
holders of Awards).

The Committee may make an Award in substitution for incentive awards, stock
awards, stock options or similar awards held by an individual who becomes an
employee of the Company, a subsidiary or an affiliate in connection with a
transaction described in the second paragraph of this Section 4. Notwithstanding
any provision of the Plan (other than the limitation set forth in the first
paragraph of this Section 4), the terms of such substituted Awards shall be as
the Committee, in its discretion, determines is appropriate.

Section 5.  Awards.

(a)  General.  The types of Awards that may be granted under the Plan are set
forth below. Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem with
other Awards.

     (i)  Stock Options.  A Stock Option represents the right to purchase a
     share of Stock at a predetermined grant price. Stock Options granted under
     the Plan may be in the form of Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified
     Stock Options, as specified in the Award agreement but no Stock Option
     designated as an Incentive Stock Option shall be invalid in the event that
     it fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. The term of each Stock
     Option shall be set forth in the Award agreement, but no Stock Option shall
     be exercisable more than ten years after the grant date. The grant price
     per share of Common Stock purchasable under a Stock Option shall not be
     less than 100% of
                                       B-3
<PAGE>

     the Fair Market Value on the date of grant. Subject to the applicable Award
     agreement, Stock Options may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving
     written notice of exercise specifying the number of shares to be purchased.
     Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price
     by certified or bank check or such other instrument as the Company may
     accept (including a copy of instructions to a broker or bank acceptable to
     the Company to deliver promptly to the Company an amount of sale or loan
     proceeds sufficient to pay the purchase price). As determined by the
     Committee, payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of
     Common Stock already owned by the optionee valued at Fair Market Value on
     the day preceding the date of exercise; provided, however, that such Common
     Stock shall not have been acquired by the optionee within the preceding six
     months.

     (ii)  Stock Appreciation Rights.  An SAR represents the right to receive a
     payment, in cash, shares of Common Stock, or both (as determined by the
     Committee), with a value equal to the Spread Value on the date the SAR is
     exercised. The grant price of an SAR shall be set forth in the applicable
     Award agreement and shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on
     the date of grant. Subject to the terms of the applicable Award agreement,
     an SAR shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, by giving written notice
     of exercise.

     (iii)  Other Stock-Based Awards.  Other Stock-Based Awards are Awards,
     other than Stock Options, SARs or Restricted Stock, that are denominated
     in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or
     related to, Common Stock. The grant, purchase, exercise, exchange or
     conversion of Other Stock-Based Awards granted under this subsection (iii)
     shall be on such terms and conditions and by such methods as shall be
     specified by the Committee. Where the value of an Other Stock-Based Award
     is based on the Spread Value, the grant price for such an Award will not be
     less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.

     (iv)  Restricted Stock.  Shares of Restricted Stock are shares of Common
     Stock that are awarded to a participant and that during the Restricted
     Period may be forfeitable to the Company upon such conditions as may be set
     forth in the applicable Award agreement. Restricted Stock may not be sold,
     assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered during the
     Restricted Period. Except as provided in the applicable Award agreement, a
     participant shall have with respect to such Restricted Stock all the rights
     of a holder of Common Stock during the Restricted Period.

     (v)  Incentive Awards.  Incentive Awards are performance-based Awards that
     are expressed in U.S. currency or Common Stock or any combination thereof.
     Incentive Awards shall either be Annual Incentive Awards or Long-Term
     Incentive Awards.

(b)  Maximum Awards.  Subject to the exercise of the Board's authority pursuant
to Section 4:

     (i)  The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to Stock Options
     and Stock Appreciation Rights awarded during any calendar year to any
     participant shall not exceed 7,500,000 shares.

     (ii)  The total amount of any Annual Incentive Award awarded to any
     participant with respect to any Performance Cycle shall not exceed
     $7,500,000.

     (iii)  The total amount of any Long-Term Incentive Award awarded to any
     Participant with respect to any Performance Cycle shall not exceed 150,000
     shares of Common Stock multiplied by the number of years in the Performance
     Cycle or, in the case of awards expressed in currency, $4,500,000
     multiplied by the number of years in the Performance Cycle.

     (iv)  An amount not in excess of 18,800,000 shares of Common Stock may be
     issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards, and
     Incentive Awards, except that Other Stock-Based Awards with values based on
     Spread Values shall not be included in this limitation.

(c)  Performance-Based Awards.  Any Awards granted pursuant to the Plan may be
in the form of performance-based Awards through the application of Performance
Goals and Performance Cycles.

Section 6.  Change in Control Provisions.

(a)  Impact of Event.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the
contrary, in the event of a Change in Control:

     (i)  All Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the
     date such Change in Control occurs shall become fully vested and
     exercisable.

     (ii)  The restrictions and other conditions applicable to any Restricted
     Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards, including vesting requirements, shall
     lapse, and such Awards shall become free of all restrictions and fully
     vested.

     (iii)  The value of all outstanding Stock Options, Stock Appreciation
     Rights, Restricted Stock and Other Stock-Based Awards shall, unless
     otherwise determined by the Committee at or after grant, be cashed out on
     the basis of the "Change in Control Price," as defined in Section 6(c), as
     of the date such Change in Control occurs or such other date as the
     Committee may determine prior to the Change in Control.

     (iv)  Any Incentive Awards relating to Performance Cycles prior to the
     Performance Cycle in which the Change in Control occurs that have been
     earned but not paid shall become immediately payable in cash. In addition,
     each participant who has been awarded an Incentive Award shall be deemed to
     have earned a pro rata Incentive Award equal to the product of (A) such
     participant's maximum award opportunity for such Performance Cycle, and (B)
     a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full or partial months
     that have elapsed since the beginning of such Performance Cycle to the date
     on which the Change in Control occurs, and the denominator of which is the
     total number of months in such Performance Cycle.

(b)  Definition of Change in Control.  A "Change in Control" means the happening
of any of the following events:

     (i)  Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a reorganization,
     merger, share exchange or consolidation (a "Business Combination"), unless
     in each case following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially
     all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of the
     outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in
     the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities")
     immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own (within the
     meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), directly or
     indirectly, more than 50% of, respectively, the outstanding shares of
     common stock and the combined voting power of the outstanding voting
     securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the
     corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without
     limitation, a corporation that as a result of such transaction owns the
     Company through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same
     proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business
     Combination of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities, (B) no
     individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or
     14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (a "Person") (excluding Philip Morris
     Companies Inc., any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or
     maintained by the Company, Philip Morris Companies Inc. or such corporation
     resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or
     indirectly, 20% or more, respectively, the outstanding shares of common
     stock and of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
     securities of such corporation except to the extent that such Person owned
     20% or more of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities prior to the
     Business Combination and (C) at least a majority of the members of the
     board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business
     Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the
     execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board,
     providing for such Business Combination; or

     (ii)  Approval by the shareholders of the Company of (A) a complete
     liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (B) the sale or other
     disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company,
                                       B-5
<PAGE>

     other than to a corporation with respect to which, following such sale or
     other disposition, (1) more than 50% of, respectively, the outstanding
     shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then
     outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote
     generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly
     or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities
     who were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities
     immediately prior to such sale or other disposition in substantially the
     same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such sale or other
     disposition, of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may
     be, (2) less than 20% of, respectively, the outstanding shares of common
     stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
     securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
     of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any
     Person (excluding Philip Morris Companies Inc., any employee benefit plan
     (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company, Philip Morris
     Companies Inc. or such corporation), except to the extent that such Person
     owned 20% or more of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities prior to the
     sale or disposition and (3) at least a majority of the members of the board
     of directors of such corporation were members of the Incumbent Board at the
     time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the
     Board, providing for such sale or other disposition of assets of the
     Company; or

     (iii)  The sale or other disposition for fair value of securities of the
     Company by Philip Morris Companies Inc. if, after such sale or other
     disposition for value Philip Morris Companies Inc. holds less than 50% of
     the combined voting power of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities; or

     (iv)  If Philip Morris Companies Inc. holds less than 50% of the combined
     voting power of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities by virtue of a
     transaction that does not constitute a Change in Control within the meaning
     of paragraph (iii) above, the acquisition by any Person of beneficial
     ownership of 20% or more of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities;
     provided, however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute a
     Change in Control: (1) any acquisition by such Person directly from the
     Company, (2) any acquisition by the Company, (3) any acquisition by any
     employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the
     Company, Philip Morris Companies Inc. or any entity controlled by the
     Company or (4) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction
     described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of paragraph (i) of this Section
     6(b); or

     (v)  If Philip Morris Companies Inc. holds less than 50% of the combined
     voting power of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities by virtue of a
     transaction that does not constitute a Change in Control within the meaning
     of paragraph (iii) above, the individuals who constitute the Incumbent
     Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board.

(c)  Change in Control Price.  "Change in Control Price" means the highest price
per share paid in any transaction reported on the New York Stock
Exchange-Composite Transactions or paid or offered in any bona fide transaction
related to a potential or actual change in control of the Company at any time
during the preceding 60-day period as determined by the Committee, except that,
in the case of Incentive Stock Options, such price shall be based only on
transactions reported for the date on which such Incentive Stock Options are
cashed out.

(d)  Incumbent Board.  "Incumbent Board" means the members of the Board as of
the effective date of the Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any
individual who becomes a member of the Board after such effective date whose
election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of the Company, was
approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the
Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such member were a member of the
Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose
initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened
election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other
actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
Person other than the Board.

                                       B-6
<PAGE>

(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, upon a Change in Control,
unless the Committee shall determine otherwise at grant, an Award recipient
shall have the right, by giving notice to the Company within the Exercise
Period, to elect to surrender all or part of the Stock Option, SAR, Restricted
Stock or Other Stock-Based Award to the Company and to receive in cash, within
30 days of such notice, an amount equal to the amount by which the "Change in
Control Price" on the date of such notice shall exceed the exercise or grant
price under such Award, multiplied by the number of shares of Stock as to which
the right granted under this Section 6 shall have been exercised.

Section 7.  Plan Amendment and Termination.

The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time, provided that no such
amendment shall be made without shareholder approval if such approval is
required under applicable law, or if such amendment would: (i) decrease the
grant or exercise price of any Stock Option, SAR or Other Stock-Based Award to
less than the Fair Market Value on the date of grant; or (ii) increase the total
number of shares of Common Stock that may be distributed under the Plan. Except
as may be necessary to comply with a change in the laws, regulations or
accounting principles of a foreign country applicable to participants subject to
the laws of such foreign country, the Committee may not cancel any option and
substitute therefor a new option with a lower option price. Except as set forth
in any Award agreement, no amendment or termination of the Plan may materially
and adversely affect any outstanding Award under the Plan without the Award
recipient's consent.

Section 8.  Payments and Payment Deferrals.

Payment of Awards may be in the form of cash, Stock, other Awards or
combinations thereof as the Committee shall determine, and with such
restrictions as it may impose. The Committee, either at the time of grant or by
subsequent amendment, may require or permit deferral of the payment of Awards
under such rules and procedures as it may establish. It also may provide that
deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest or other
earnings on the deferred amounts, or the payment or crediting of dividend
equivalents where the deferred amounts are denominated in Common Stock
equivalents.

Section 9.  Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.

The Committee may provide that any Awards under the Plan earn dividends or
dividend equivalents. Such dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid
currently or may be credited to a participant's Plan account. Any crediting of
dividends or dividend equivalents may be subject to such restrictions and
conditions as the Committee may establish, including reinvestment in additional
shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents.

Section 10.  Transferability.

Unless otherwise required by law, Awards shall not be transferable or assignable
other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

Section 11.  Award Agreements.

Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written agreement (which need
not be signed by the recipient unless otherwise specified by the Committee) that
sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each Award. Such terms may
include, but are not limited to, the term of the Award, vesting and forfeiture
provisions, and the provisions applicable in the event the recipient's
employment terminates. The Committee may amend an Award agreement, provided that
no such amendment may materially and adversely affect an Award without the Award
recipient's consent.

                                       B-7
<PAGE>

Section 12.  Unfunded Status Plan.

It is presently intended that the Plan constitute an "unfunded" plan for
incentive and deferred compensation. The Committee may authorize the creation of
trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to
deliver Common Stock or make payments; provided, however, that, unless the
Committee otherwise determines, the existence of such trusts or other
arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.

Section 13.  General Provisions.

(a)  The Committee may require each person acquiring shares of Common Stock
pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that
such person is acquiring the shares without a view to the distribution thereof.
The certificates for such shares may include any legend that the Committee deems
appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer.

All certificates for shares of Common Stock or other securities delivered under
the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions
as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other
requirements of the Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock
is then listed, and any applicable Federal, state or foreign securities law, and
the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates
to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

(b)  Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company, a subsidiary or an
affiliate from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements for their
respective employees.

(c)  Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the granting of Awards under the Plan
shall confer upon any employee any right to continued employment nor shall they
interfere in any way with the right of the Company, a subsidiary or an affiliate
to terminate the employment of any employee at any time.

(d)  No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in
the gross income of the participant for income tax purposes with respect to any
Award under the Plan, the participant shall pay to the Company, or make
arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any Federal,
state, local or foreign taxes of any kind which are required by law or
applicable regulation to be withheld with respect to such amount. Unless
otherwise determined by the Committee, withholding obligations arising from an
Award may be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is part of,
or is received upon exercise or conversion of, the Award that gives rise to the
withholding requirement. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be
conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company, its subsidiaries
and its affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to
deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the participant. The
Committee may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate, including the
making of irrevocable elections, for the settling of withholding obligations
with Common Stock.

(e)  The Plan and all Awards made and actions taken thereunder shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

(f)  If any provision of the Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, the
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan,
and the Plan shall be enforced and construed as if such provision had not been
included.

(g)  The Plan shall be effective upon approval by Philip Morris Companies Inc.
in its capacity as the Company's sole shareholder. Except as otherwise provided
by the Board, no Awards shall be made after June 11, 2006, provided that any
awards granted prior to that date may extend beyond it.
