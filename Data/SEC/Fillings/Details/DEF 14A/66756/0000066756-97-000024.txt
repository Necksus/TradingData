Dear  Shareholder:

     You are cordially  invited to attend Minnesota  Power's 1997 Annual Meeting
of Shareholders on Tuesday,  May 13, 1997 at 10:30 a.m. in the auditorium at the
Duluth  Entertainment  Convention  Center  (DECC).  The DECC is  located  on the
waterfront  at 350 Harbor  Drive in Duluth.  Free  parking is  available  in the
adjoining lot. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I encourage you to attend.

     This year 13  nominees  are  standing  for  election  to the Board.  We are
pleased to have a new nominee,  Ms.  Kathleen A.  Brekken,  President and CEO of
Midwest of Cannon Falls. With her election,  Ms. Brekken will bring to the Board
the  entrepreneurial and marketing skills she has used to build her family-owned
business in Cannon Falls,  Minnesota into a successful  enterprise serving major
markets in the U.S. and Canada.

     Also to be acted upon at our meeting is a shareholder proposal recommending
that the  Shareholder  Rights  Plan  adopted  by the  Board on July 26,  1996 be
repealed unless it is approved by shareholders.  As explained more fully within,
your  Board of  Directors  believes  the  Rights  Plan to be an  important  tool
available  to the Board for  assuring  that any party  interested  in  acquiring
Minnesota Power pay all shareholders full value for their shares.  Therefore, we
urge you to vote against this shareholder proposal.

     After our  Annual  Meeting,  we  invite  you to visit  with our  directors,
officers  and  employees  over a box  lunch.  A summary  of the  Annual  Meeting
proceedings  will be mailed in early  June to all  shareholders.  If you plan on
attending please return the enclosed reservation card.

     It is important that your shares be represented at the Annual  Meeting.  At
your earliest  convenience,  please sign, date, and mail the enclosed proxy card
in the envelope provided.

     Thank you for your  continued support.

                                                  Sincerely,

Board  and Committee  Meetings in 1996

     During 1996 the Board of Directors  held 6 meetings. The Executive
Committee,  which held 6 meetings during 1996, provides oversight of corporate
financial matters,  performs the functions of a director nominating committee,
and is  authorized  to exercise  the  authority  of the Board in the intervals
between meetings.  Shareholders may recommend nominees for director to the
Executive  Committee by addressing  the  Secretary of the Company,  30 West
Superior Street,  Duluth,  Minnesota  55802.  The Audit Committee,  which held
4 meetings in 1996, recommends the selection of independent  accountants,

intended  to be equitable, competitive
                                       6

with the  marketplace,  and consistent with corporate  objectives.  The Electric
Operations  Committee,  which held 4 meetings in 1996, provides oversight of the
Company's  MP  Electric  business  unit.  Directors  on the  boards  of MP Water
Resources, Inc., ADESA Corporation and MP Real Estate Holdings, Inc., all wholly
owned  subsidiaries  of Minnesota  Power,  have  oversight of Minnesota  Power's
water,  automotive,  and real estate  operations,  respectively.  All  directors
attended 75 percent or more of the aggregate  number of meetings of the Board of
Directors  and  applicable  committee  meetings  in  1996.

Director  Compensation

     Employee directors receive no additional compensation for their services as
directors.  In 1996 the Company  paid each  director an annual  retainer  fee of
$5,000 and 500 shares of Common Stock under the terms of the Company's  Director
Stock Plan. In addition,  each director was paid $950 for each Board, Committee,
and subsidiary board meeting attended,  except that $500 was paid for attendance
at a second meeting held the same day as another  meeting.  Each director who is
the  Chairman of a  Committee  received an  additional  $150 for each  Committee
meeting  attended.  A $250  fee was  paid  for  all  conference  call  meetings.
Directors may elect to defer all or a part of the cash portion of their retainer
fees and meeting fees. The shares of Common Stock paid to directors  during 1996
had an average market price of $27.24 per share.  The Company also provides life
insurance  of $5,000 on the life of each  director at an  aggregate  cost to the
Company  of $713 in 1996.  At the  Board's  direction,  Director  Evans was paid
$43,000 in 1996 for services related to the search for and hiring of Mr. Russell
to assume the office of President of the Company in 1995, and for his continuing
services  as advisor  and Board  liaison  to Mr.  Russell  when he became  Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) in January 1996.

     Effective January 1, 1996,  non-employee directors receive automatic grants
of 725 stock options every year and  performance  shares valued at $10,000 every
other year pursuant to the Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive Plan. The stock
options vest 50 percent after the first year, the remaining 50 percent after the
second  year and  expire on the  tenth  anniversary  of the date of  grant.  The
exercise  price for each grant is the closing sale price of Company Common Stock
on the date of grant. The two-year  performance  periods for performance  shares
end on December 31st the year following the date of grant.  Dividend equivalents
in the form of  additional  performance  shares  accrue  during the  performance
period  and are paid only to the  extent the  underlying  grant is  earned.  The
performance goal of each performance period is Total Shareholder Return (defined
as stock price  appreciation  plus dividends  reinvested on the ex-dividend date
throughout the performance  period,  divided by the fair market value of a share
at the beginning of the performance period) for the Company in comparison to the
Total Shareholder Return for 16 diversified utilities.

     on  January 2, 1998,  and are  subject to a change in control  acceleration
     provision.

<F2> The grant date  dollar  value of the stock  options is based on a
     combination  Black-Scholes,   binomial  price  method.  The  blended  ratio
     associated  with the  January 2, 1996  option  grants is .236,  based on an
     average industry Black-Scholes ratio of .373 and a Minnesota Power binomial
     ratio  (as of  January  2,  1996)  of .099.  The  method  is a  complicated
     mathematical    formula   premised   on   immediate    exercisability   and
     transferability  of the options,  which are not  features of the  Company's
     options granted to executive officers and other employees. The values shown
     are  theoretical  and do not  necessarily  reflect  the  actual  values the
     recipients may eventually realize. Any actual value to the officer or other
     employee  will  depend  on the  extent  to which  the  market  value of the
     Company's  common  shares at a future date exceeds the exercise  price.  In
     addition to the stock  prices at grant and the exercise  prices,  which are
     identical,  and the ten-year term of each option, the following assumptions
     for  modeling  were used to  calculate  the  values  shown for the  options
     granted on January 2, 1996:  expected dividend yield of 7.59 percent (based
     on most recent quarterly dividend), expected stock price volatility of .149
     (based on 250 trading days  previous to January 2, 1996),  and the ten-year
     option  term and a  risk-free  rate of  return  of 5.65  percent  (based on
     Treasury  yields).  The assumptions and the calculations used for the model
     were provided by an independent consulting firm.

     The table directly above reflects the number of shares of Common Stock that
can be earned  for the  1996-1997  performance  period if the Total  Shareholder
Return of the  Company  (or,  for  business  unit  executives,  other  financial
measures established for business units selected because of their correlation to
Total Shareholder Return) meets goals established by the Executive  Compensation
Committee.  These goals are based on the Company's  ranking against a peer group
of 16 diversified electric utilities. The threshold performance share award will
be earned if the  Company's  Total  Shareholder  Return  ranking  is at the 40th
percentile,  the  target  award  will be  earned if the  Company  is at the 50th
percentile,  and the maximum  award will be earned if the Company is at the 76th
percentile.  Dividend  equivalents  accrue during the performance period and are
paid in shares only to the extent performance goals are achieved.  If earned, 50
percent of the  performance  shares  will be paid in stock  after the end of the
performance  period; the remaining 50 percent will be paid in stock, half on the
first  anniversary of the end of the  performance  period and half on the second
anniversary thereof. Payment is accelerated upon a change in control of

</TABLE>

     Retirement benefit amounts shown are in the form of a straight-life annuity
to the  employee  and are based on amounts  listed in the  Summary  Compensation
Table under the headings Salary and Bonus.  Retirement benefit amounts shown are
not subject to any deduction for Social  Security or other offset  amounts.  The
Retirement  Plan  provides  that the benefit  amount at retirement is subject to
adjustment  in future  years to reflect  cost of living  increases  to a maximum
adjustment  of 3 percent  per year.  As of  December  31,  1996  (except for Mr.
Sandbulte whose service is determined as of May 31, 1996, his retirement  date),
the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table had the following
number of years of credited service under the plan:

        Edwin L. Russell      2 years         John Cirello          2 years
        Arend J.  Sandbulte  31 years         Donnie R.  Crandell  15 years
        Robert D. Edwards    20 years         David G. Gartzke     21 years

     With certain  exceptions,  the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended,
(Code)  restricts the aggregate amount of annual pension which may be paid to an

                                       11
<PAGE>

employee under the Retirement Plan to $120,000 for 1996, which amount is subject
to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living increases. The Company's
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides for supplemental payments by the
Company to eligible  executives  (including the executive  officers named in the
Summary  Compensation  Table) in amounts sufficient to maintain total retirement
benefits  upon  retirement  at a level  which  would have been  provided  by the
Retirement  Plan if benefits  were not  restricted by the  Code.

Report of Board Executive Compensation Committee on Executive Compensation

     Described below are the compensation policies of the Executive Compensation
Committee  of the Board of  Directors  effective  for 1996 with  respect  to the
executive  officers of the Company.  Composed  entirely of  independent  outside
directors,  the Executive Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending
to the Board  policies  which govern the executive  compensation  program of the
Company  and  for  administering   those  policies.   To  assist  the  Executive
Compensation   Committee   in   connection   with   the   performance   of  such
responsibilities for 1996, the Board retained the services of William M. Mercer,
Inc. (Mercer), a benefits and compensation consulting firm.

     The role of the  executive  compensation  program  is to help  the  Company
achieve  its  corporate  goals by  motivating  performance,  rewarding  positive
results,  and encouraging  teamwork.  Recognizing  that the potential  impact an
individual  employee has on the attainment of corporate  goals tends to increase
at higher levels within the Company, the executive compensation program provides
greater  variability in compensating  individuals  based on results  achieved as
their  levels  within the Company  rise.  In other words,  individuals  with the
greatest potential impact on achieving the stated goals have the greatest amount
to gain when goals are achieved  and the greatest  amount at risk when goals are
not achieved.

     The  program  also  recognizes   that,  in  order  to  attract  and  retain
exceptional  executive talent,  compensation must be competitive in the national
market when measured against comparable  companies within that market. For those
executives engaged primarily or exclusively in electric operations, the relevant
market for purposes of comparison is other  electric  utilities  throughout  the
country  which,  on average,  are  comparable in size to the Company.  For those
executives engaged  substantially in the Company's  diversification  activities,
the market for purposes of  comparison  includes  both  electric  utilities  and
general industry. Comparisons with the general industry market allow recognition
of skills  required in  diversification  activities and  compensation  levels of
executives in other industries.

     To determine market levels of compensation for executive  officers in 1996,
the  Executive  Compensation  Committee  relied  upon  comparative   information
provided  by  Mercer,  based on  seven  surveys  including  data  from  over 100
utilities  and  several  hundred  general  industrial  companies.  All data were
analyzed to determine  median  compensation  levels for comparable  positions in
comparably-sized  companies.  While these companies are not the same as those in
the  peer  group  used in the  performance  graph,  the  Executive  Compensation
Committee believes that these companies are 

                                       12
<PAGE>

appropriate for market compensation comparison, primarily because they are 
approximately  the same size as the Company as measured  by sales  revenue.

     The Executive  Compensation Committee determined that executive base salary
plus  additional  performance-based  compensation  at the  target  level  should
approximate   the   midpoint   of  the   range  of  base   salary   plus   total
performance-based compensation in the appropriate market. Executive compensation
actually paid by the Company for 1996 was above target,  on average,  reflecting
the fact that both financial and  non-financial  goals were, on average,  met or
exceeded. As a result, executive compensation paid in 1996 fell at the upper end
of the mid-range of executive compensation paid by comparable companies.

     Section  162(m) of the Internal  Revenue Code,  enacted in 1993,  generally
disallows a tax deduction to public companies for  compensation  over $1 million
paid to the corporation's CEO and four other most highly  compensated  executive
officers.  Qualifying performance-based  compensation will not be subject to the
deduction  limit  if  certain  requirements  are  met.  The  stock  options  and
performance shares granted to the executive officers in 1996 under the Executive
Long-Term   Incentive   Compensation   Plan   are   intended   to   qualify   as
performance-based  compensation  and should  therefore be fully  deductible  for
Federal  income tax  purposes.  The Company  currently  intends to structure the
performance-based  portion  of its  executive  officer  compensation  to achieve
maximum  deductibility  under Section 162(m) so long as this can be done without
sacrificing flexibility and corporate objectives.

     As  described   below,   executive   officers  of  the  Company  receive  a
compensation  package  which  consists  of four  basic  elements:  base  salary,
performance-based compensation, supplemental executive benefits and perquisites.
The CEO's compensation is discussed separately.

Base Salary

     Base  salaries  are  set at a  level  so  that,  if  the  target  level  of
performance is achieved under the  performance-based  plans as described  below,
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of the
performance-based  compensation  plans,  will be near  the  midpoint  of  market
compensation as described  above.  Base salaries of the executive  officers were
increased by an average of 7.6 percent in 1996,  reflecting market  adjustments,
merit increases and promotions.

Performance-Based  Compensation

     Performance-based  compensation  includes  stock  options and  performance
shares awarded under the new Executive  Long-Term  Incentive Plan,  Common Stock
under the old Long-Term  Incentive Plan, as well as the opportunity to earn cash
awards under Results Sharing and the Annual  Incentive Plan.  Performance  goals
are approved in advance by the Executive Compensation Committee and the Board. A
target  level  of  performance  under  the  performance-based  plans  represents
performance  that is either  consistent  with or above budget,  or represents at
least median Total Shareholder  Return  performance as measured against the peer
groups  described  below.  Total  Shareholder  Return is defined as stock  price
appreciation  plus dividends  reinvested on the ex-dividend  date throughout the
relevant performance 

                                       13

period, divided by the fair market value of a share at the beginning of the
performance period. With target performance, plus the value of stock options
granted,  executive  compensation  will be near  the  midpoint  of the relevant
market. If no performance  awards are earned, and no value is attributed to the
stock options granted, compensation of the Company's executive officers would
be approximately 70 percent of the market compensation level, while performance
at increments  above the target level will result in total  compensation  above
the midpoint of the  market.

The  Company's  performance-based  compensation  plans include:

     - Results Sharing.  The Results Sharing award opportunity rewards annual
       performance  of the  executive's  responsibility  area as well as overall
       corporate performance.  Awards are available to all employees on the same
       percentage of pay basis.  Target financial  performance will result in an
       award  of  5  percent  of  base  salary,   assuming  non-financial  goals
       established   by  the   Executive   Compensation   Committee   are   also
       accomplished.  For 1996 the electric  and water  utility  business  units
       earned  Results  Sharing  awards  equaling 6.8 percent and 9.5 percent of
       base  salary,  respectively,  based on business  unit  pre-tax  operating
       income results  (weighted 75 percent) and earnings per share  performance
       (weighted  25  percent).  Based  on its  contributions  to the  Company's
       earnings per share target,  the real estate business unit earned an award
       of 7.5 percent of base salary. The Corporate group earned an award of 7.3
       percent of base salary,  which is an average of the above  business  unit
       results, weighted by payroll of each business unit. To earn these awards,
       non-financial goals approved by the Executive Compensation Committee were
       also achieved.

     - Annual Incentive Plan. The Annual Incentive Plan is intended to focus
       executive  attention  on  meeting  and  exceeding  annual  financial  and
       non-financial   business   unit  goals   established   by  the  Executive
       Compensation  Committee.  For  1996  corporate  executive  officers  were
       rewarded for corporate  performance  as measured by earnings per share of
       the  Company's  Common Stock,  while the  executive  officers of the real
       estate business unit were rewarded for the contribution of their business
       unit to earnings  per share.  The  executive  officers  of the  Company's
       electric and water business units were rewarded for  performance of their
       respective business units in 1996 as measured by operating cash return on
       investment  (weighted  50 to 60  percent)  and  operating  free cash flow
       (weighted 40 to 50 percent). These measures of financial performance were
       chosen  by  the  Executive   Compensation   Committee  because  they  are
       positively  correlated with the Total Shareholder  Return achieved by the
       Company  for its  shareholders.  Target  level  performance  is earned if
       budgeted  financial results are achieved.  In 1996 executive  officers in
       the Corporate group earned awards  averaging 38 percent of base salary by
       achieving  earnings  of $2.28 per share of  Common  Stock of the  Company
       compared  to the budget of $2.25,  and  achieving  certain  non-financial
       goals. The top executive officer in each of the electric,  water and real
       estate  business units earned awards ranging from 53.7 to 74.1 percent of
       base salary by exceeding financial and non-financial goals established by
       the Executive Compensation Committee.
                                       14

     - Long-Term  Incentive  Plans.  The  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan is
       designed to motivate  long-term  strategic  planning and reward long-term
       corporate  performance,  as  measured  by Total  Shareholder  Return over
       four-year  performance  periods commencing each January. At the outset of
       each  performance  period,  the  executive  officers were given a maximum
       award  opportunity  of a stated number of shares of the Company's  Common
       Stock.  Sixty  percent  of the  award  opportunity  with  respect  to the
       four-year  period ending  December 31, 1996,  was based upon rank among a
       peer group of ten utilities  operating in the same  geographic  region as
       the Company (Upper Midwest), and 40 percent of this award opportunity was
       based on rank among the S&P 500 companies.  For the four-year performance
       period ending  December 31, 1996,  the maximum award  opportunity  ranged
       from 2,000 to 5,000 shares for the executive officers.  The maximum award
       opportunity  is earned if the  Company  ranks first or second in the peer
       group and at or above the 90th  percentile  among the S&P 500  companies.
       The Company must achieve at least a 55th percentile  ranking among a peer
       group of ten  utilities or a 40th  percentile  ranking  among the S&P 500
       companies  for any  award to be  earned.  For the  four-year  performance
       period  ending  December  31,  1996,  no awards were  earned  because the
       Company did not achieve a Total Shareholder  Return at the level required
       for a payout  under the plan.  To motivate the CEO to maintain a focus on
       the long-term performance of the Company during the last years before the
       CEO's retirement,  the Executive  Compensation Committee has provided for
       the continuing  participation of the CEO in the Long-Term  Incentive Plan
       after retirement.  Consistent with this practice,  in 1995, and effective
       with his  retirement  from the office of CEO in January  1996,  the Board
       provided  for  the  continued  participation  of  Mr.  Sandbulte  in  the
       Long-Term Incentive Plan with four-year performance periods commencing on
       each January 1 from 1996 through the year 2000, with a target opportunity
       in each year equal to 27 percent of his 1996 base salary. Any awards will
       be paid to Mr. Sandbulte in cash.

       Effective for 1996 no further  performance  periods were initiated  under
       the Long-Term  Incentive Plan,  except for Mr. Sandbulte as stated above,
       and, with shareholder  approval,  the new Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
       Compensation  Plan  was  implemented.  Under  the new  plan,  in 1996 the
       executive  officers  of  the  Company  were  awarded  stock  options  and
       performance  shares having target award values ranging from 25 percent to
       35  percent of the  executives'  base  salaries.  The value of each award
       opportunity  was divided  equally  between stock options and  performance
       shares.  The stock options will have value if the Company's  Common Stock
       price  appreciates.  The  performance  shares  will have value if, in two
       years from the date of grant, the Total Shareholder Return of the Company
       (or, for business unit executives,  other financial measures  established
       for  business  units  selected  because  of  their  correlation  to Total
       Shareholder Return) meets goals established by the Executive Compensation
       Committee.  These goals are based on the Company's ranking against a peer
       group of 16  diversified  electric  utilities  recommended  by Mercer and
       adopted by the Executive Compensation Committee as

                                       15
<PAGE>


       appropriate comparators. The threshold performance share award will be
       earned if the Company's Total Shareholder Return ranking is at the 40th
       percentile, the target award will be earned if the Company is at the
       50th  percentile,  and the  maximum  award will be earned if the Company
       is at the 76th percentile. Dividend equivalents accrue during the
       performance period and are paid in shares only to the extent performance
       goals are achieved. If earned, 50 percent of the performance shares will
       be paid in stock after the end of the performance  period; the remaining
       50 percent will be paid in stock,  half on the first  anniversary of the
       end of the performance period and half on the second anniversary
       thereof. Payment is  accelerated upon a change in control of the Company
       at 200 percent of the target number of  performance  shares granted as
       increased by dividend  equivalents  for the  performance  period.  These
       awards are consistent  with the  Executive  Compensation  Committee's
       philosophy of linking a significant portion of the executive officers'
       compensation to  the performance of the Company as measured by Total
       Shareholder Return or by other  measures of financial  performance which
       correlate with Total  Shareholder Return.

Supplemental Executive  Benefits

     The Company has established a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
to treat  employees,  including the executive  officers,  equitably by replacing
benefits not provided by the  Company's  Flexible  Benefit Plan and the Employee
Stock Ownership Plan due to government-imposed  limits and to provide retirement
benefits which are competitive with those offered by other businesses with which
the Company  competes for managerial  talent.  The SERP also provides  employees
whose salaries exceed the salary limitations for tax-qualified  plans imposed by
the Code with  additional  benefits  such that they  receive  in  aggregate  the
benefits they would have been entitled to receive had such  limitations not been
imposed.

     The Company has also adopted  Executive  Investment Plans whereby executive
officers  may enter into  agreements  with the  Company to  irrevocably  defer a
portion of their compensation until after termination of service,  retirement or
death. The Executive  Investment Plans are non-qualified  deferred  compensation
plans under which benefits result wholly from deferred compensation.

Perquisites

     The Company  provides  various  perquisites  to assist  selected  executive
officers  in  fulfilling  their  business  responsibilities  in a cost  and time
efficient manner,  to the extent they are consistent with competitive  practice.
Perquisites  provided by the  Company to the named  executive  officers  did not
exceed the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the total  salary and bonus  shown
for them in the Summary  Compensation  Table.  The  perquisites  provided by the
Company were reviewed by the Executive  Compensation Committee and determined to
be reasonable and in line with electric utility companies of comparable size.

Chief  Executive  Officer  Compensation

     In January 1996 the Board of Directors increased Mr. Russell's annual base

                                       16
<PAGE>

salary 8.3 percent in conjunction  with his election to the office of CEO. Under
the Company's  Results  Sharing Plan,  Mr. Russell was awarded  $23,416,  or 7.3
percent  of his base  salary,  which was  calculated  based on an average of the
Results   Sharing  awards  paid  to  the  Company's   business  units  for  1996
performance,  weighted by the payroll of each  business  unit. In April 1996 Mr.
Russell was paid a bonus of $125,000, which the Executive Compensation Committee
determined would be appropriate  based upon Mr.  Russell's  contributions to the
Company in 1995. Under Minnesota Power's Annual Incentive Plan for the Company's
performance in 1996, Mr. Russell earned an award of $220,220, or 67.8 percent of
his base  salary,  based on a formula  established  in advance by the  Executive
Compensation  Committee which rewarded Mr.  Russell,  as well as other executive
officers in the Corporate group, for above-budget earnings per share performance
by the  Company  in 1996,  as well as for  achievement  of  non-financial  goals
established by the Executive Compensation Committee.

     Mr. Russell's  compensation  plan also contains elements which motivate him
to focus on the longer-term  performance of the Company.  To align Mr. Russell's
financial  interests  with  those of the  shareholders  and to help  retain  his
services for the full four-year  vesting period,  Mr. Russell was awarded 24,000
shares of  restricted  Common  Stock of the Company  effective  January 2, 1996,
pursuant to the  Company's  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan,
subject  to the  restriction  that his right to retain  ownership  in said stock
would vest at the rate of 6,000 shares per year  beginning  in 1996.  Also under
the Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan,  in January  1996,  Mr.
Russell  was  awarded  a target  opportunity  valued at 55  percent  of his base
salary.  This value was divided  equally  between stock options and  performance
shares.  The stock options  become fully  exercisable in two years and expire 10
years from the date of grant. The options will have value if the Company's stock
price  appreciates.  The  performance  shares will have target  value if, in two
years from the date of grant, the Total  Shareholder  Return realized by Company
shareholders  is at the  50th  percentile  of a  peer  group  of 16  diversified
utilities  recommended  by Mercer  and  adopted  by the  Executive  Compensation
Committee as appropriate comparators.

     To recruit Mr.  Russell  from  general  industry and retain his services at
Minnesota Power, the Executive  Compensation Committee has endeavored to provide
Mr. Russell with a compensation  package that is half-way  between the midpoints
of  compensation  paid by electric  utilities and  compensation  paid by general
industrial  companies  the  approximate  size of the Company.  The  Compensation
Committee has designed Mr. Russell's compensation package to provide substantial
incentive to achieve and exceed the Board's Total  Shareholder  Return goals for
the Company's shareholders.

LAREX Economic Development Project

     In 1995  Minnesota  Power began  developing  plans for an energy park to be
located on its property  adjacent to its Boswell Energy Center in Cohasset,  MN.
The first tenant of the energy park is LAREX International, Inc. LAREX developed
a process to extract from  certain  tree  species a substance  that is used in a
variety of  commercial  applications.  Minnesota  Power,  through a  subsidiary,
entered  into a contract  to pay M. A.  Mortenson  Company  $1.336  million  for
construction of the buildings to be occupied by LAREX, and agreed to lease these
buildings to LAREX. The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB), a
local  economic  development  agency,  has agreed to purchase the buildings from
Minnesota  Power's  subsidiary for an amount equal to the cost of  construction,
and the subsidiary  will then assign the building lease to the IRRRB.  Minnesota
Power has  entered  into a  separate  ground  lease  with  LAREX at an  economic
development rate which Minnesota Power will offer to other tenants of the energy
park.  Minnesota  Power has also  provided  financing  to LAREX in the amount of
$200,000 under the customary terms of the Minnesota Power's Economic Development
Loan Program.  This financing was used to purchase  equipment in which Minnesota
Power has  retained a security  interest.  LAREX is  providing  quality jobs and
represented  an  important  first step in the  development  of the energy  park.
Following  the sale of the building and  assignments  of the leases as described
above,  only the  Economic  Development  Loan will remain an  obligation  to the
Company.

     LAREX was founded in 1993 by Medical  Innovation Fund II of Minneapolis and
Northeast  Ventures of Duluth.  To date,  LAREX's  owners have  invested  $7.434
million in LAREX as follows:  Medical  Innovation  Fund II has  invested  $3.406
million and holds 53.0  percent of all stock  currently  outstanding;  Northeast
Ventures has invested  $1,030,000 and holds 16.3 percent of the currently issued
and outstanding stock; and the remaining investment and stock is held by various
individuals and entities including Larex  International  Investors Ltd. (LII), a
partnership of which Kolya Management  Company is the general  partner.  LII has
invested $1.1 million.  Medical Innovation Fund II, Northeast Ventures, and LII,
in addition to certain other  investors in LAREX,  have received  warrant rights
based on their respective  participation in specific periodic financing activity
in LAREX.

     Minnesota  Power Director Robert  Nickoloff  serves as a General Partner of
Medical  Innovation  Partners II,  possessing a 20 percent  ownership  interest.
Medical Innovation Partners II is the general partner of Medical Innovation Fund
II. In addition,  Mr.  Nickoloff  serves on the boards of directors of Northeast
Ventures and LAREX.  Northeast Ventures,  together with its affiliate Iron Range
Ventures,  is a $9.0  million  venture  capital fund  investing in  northeastern
Minnesota. Minnesota Power purchased a 21 percent interest in Northeast Ventures
for $1  million  in 1989 at a time  when  there  were no  relationships  between
Northeast Ventures and

                                       18
<PAGE>

     Minnesota  Power or its directors or employees. Minnesota Power invested in
Northeast  Ventures as an economic  development  contribution and agreed that it
will not  withdraw  its  investment.  Mr.  Gregory  Sandbulte,  the son of Arend
Sandbulte,  former  Minnesota  Power  Chairman,  CEO and President,  and current
Director,  is currently president of Northeast Ventures and a director of LAREX.
Mr. Nick Smith serves as chairman and CEO of Northeast Ventures, and is a member
of the Minnesota  Power and LAREX boards of directors.  Geraldine R.  VanTassel,
former Vice President - Corporate  Resource  Planning of Minnesota  Power,  is a
director of Northeast Ventures.  Mr. Gregory Sandbulte and Mr. Smith, along with
a third party, are general partners in Kolya Management Company,  holding a five
percent ownership interest.  Mr. Bo Nickoloff,  the son of Mr. Robert Nickoloff,
is an employee of  LAREX.

Minnesota  Power Common Stock Performance

     The following graph compares the Company's  cumulative Total Shareholder
Return on its Common Stock  with the  cumulative  return of the S&P 500  Index
and the S&P  Utilities Index,  a  capitalization-weighted  index of 26 stocks,
which is designed  to measure the  performance of the electric power utility
company sector of the S&P 500 Index.  The S&P 500 Index is a  capitalization-
weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad
domestic economy through changes in the  aggregate  market value of 500 stocks 
representing  all major  industries. Because this composite  index has a broad
industry base, its performance may not closely track that of a composite index
comprised solely of electric  utilities. In  previous  Proxy  Statements,  the
Company  used the Duff & Phelps  Electric Utility  Index  which is no longer
published.  The  calculations  assume a $100 investment on December 31, 1991,
and  reinvestment  of all dividends at the time paid.

Certain  Relationships  and  Related  Transactions

     Effective  August 21,  1996,  Minnesota  Power  acquired  the  remaining 17
percent  ownership  interest  in ADESA  Corporation  from the  ADESA  management
shareholders.  In  connection  with the  transaction,  Mr.  D.  Michael  Hockett
resigned  from his  positions  as  Director  of  Minnesota  Power and  Chairman,
Director and CEO of ADESA,  and Mr. Larry Wechter resigned from his positions as
Director and President of ADESA.  Mr. Hallett,  who was previously  President of
ADESA-Canada and a director of ADESA, was elected President and CEO of ADESA. In
connection  with this  transaction,  Minnesota  Power paid $36.0  million to Mr.
Hockett,  $2.7 million to Mr. Wechter, $1.2 million to Mr. James P. Hallett, and
$1.7 million to Mr. John E. Fuller.

     In 1996 ADESA leased space for its principal  offices in an office building
located at 1919 S. Post Road,  Indianapolis,  Indiana, from CIL, Inc., an entity
that is wholly owned by the former  Chairman,  President  and CEO of ADESA,  Mr.
Hockett.  This lease  terminates on February 28, 1998, and ADESA management does
not plan on renewal.  ADESA paid an aggregate  of $144,000 in lease  payments to
CIL during 1996.  Management believes that the terms of the lease are comparable
to terms that could be obtained by ADESA from  unrelated  parties for comparable
rental  property.  As  specified  under a  services  agreement  with CIL,  ADESA
received  $99,623 in fees from CIL in 1996 for  providing  certain  general  and
administrative services to CIL.

              ITEM NO. 2 - APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  has
recommended the appointment of Price  Waterhouse as independent  accountants for
the Company for the year 1997.  Price  Waterhouse has acted in the same capacity
since October 1963.

     A  representative  of the  accounting  firm will be  present  at the Annual
Meeting of  Shareholders,  will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or
she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

     In connection with the 1996 audit, Price Waterhouse  reviewed the Company's
annual report,  examined the related financial statements,  and reviewed interim
financial  statements  and  certain of the  Company's  filings  with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     The Board of  Directors  recommends a vote "FOR" the  appointment  of Price
Waterhouse as the Company's independent accountants for 1997.

Change in  Accountants

     On September 3, 1996, the Board of Directors of ADESA Corporation  resolved
to engage Price Waterhouse LLP as independent accountants for ADESA for the year
ended December 31, 1996, and dismiss Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) as such independent
accountants.  This change was effected for purposes of administrative efficiency
and  cost  effectiveness  following  the  purchase  by  Minnesota  Power  of the
remaining 17 percent minority  interest in ADESA in August 1996.  During the two
fiscal years ended December 31, 1995, and the subsequent  interim period through
September  3,  1996,  there  were no  disagreements  with E&Y on any  matters of
accounting principles or practices,  financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedures  which,  if not resolved to the  satisfaction  of E&Y, would
have caused E&Y to make reference to the matter in their report.  E&Y reports on
ADESA's  financial  statements  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994, and
six-month  periods  ended June 30, 1995,  and  December  31, 1995,  contained no
adverse  opinion or  disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as
to uncertainty or audit scope.  E&Y's letter dated September 5, 1996,  addressed
to the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  stated it  agreed  with the above
statements.

                ITEM NO. 3 - SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING THE
                       COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The following  proposal was submitted by Mr. Kenneth Steiner of Great Neck,
NY who owns 394 shares of Minnesota  Power Common  Stock.  The  Minnesota  Power
Board of Directors recommends a vote "AGAINST" this resolution.

     RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Minnesota Power & Light Company urge the
board of  directors  to redeem any  shareholder  rights plan unless the issue is
approved by the affirmative  vote of a majority of the  outstanding  shares at a
meeting of the shareholders held as soon as possible.

     Supporting   Statement:   Minnesota   Power  &  Light  Company   adopted  a
"Shareholder Rights Plan" in July 1996 that provides formidable  protection from
acquirers  who would seek to purchase the company  without board  approval.  The
Rights Plan,  commonly  known as a "Poison Pill" would become  exercisable  if a
person or group  were to acquire  15  percent  or more of the  company's  common
stock.

     I believe that this Poison Pill is both unnecessary and harmful.  It serves
to entrench  management  and the board of directors.  It makes it more difficult
for an outside  concern to acquire  our stock at a premium  price  because  they
could not go directly to the shareholders with a tender offer. Minnesota Power &
Light stock has under performed its peer group and the S&P 500 in 1993 and 1994,
as can be seen on page 20 of last year's proxy statement. The board of directors
owns very little common stock of Minnesota  Power & Light,  which can be seen on
page 3 of last year's proxy statement.  They have  unilaterally  taken action to
institute the "Poison Pill" plan without asking the other  shareholders (who own
99% of the company's stock) what they think. The Shareholder Rights Plan is both
untimely and ill-conceived, in my opinion.

     Recently Phillip Morris and Chase Manhattan both voluntarily redeemed their
own Poison  Pills.  Minnesota  Power & Light Company  should  attempt to emulate
these well-run companies and do the same. At the very least, it should be put to
a shareholder vote.

     I urge your support. Vote for this proposal.

Board of Directors Statement  Opposing the Resolution

     The Board of  Directors  authorized  the Rights  Agreement,  dated July 24,
1996, between the Company and the Corporate  Secretary of the Company, as Rights
Agent ("Rights Plan") to protect the interests of Minnesota  Power  shareholders
in the event that Minnesota Power is confronted with an acquisition  proposal at
a  price  deemed  by  the  Board  to  be  inadequate,  and  to  protect  against
acquisitions  that would result in unequal  treatment  among  shareholders.  The
Rights Plan is designed to prevent a potential  acquiror from gaining control of
the Company without offering all shareholders  what the Board believes to be the
full value of their investment and to otherwise  preserve the long-term value of
the Company for all shareholders.  The Rights Plan is also designed to prevent a
potential acquiror from acquiring a controlling  interest in the Company through
open market  purchases  without paying a control premium to all shareholders and
can prevent other takeover  tactics that the Board concludes are not in the best
interests of Minnesota Power's shareholders.

     The  rights are  excercisable  only if a person or group of  affiliated  or
associated  persons (1)  acquires,  or obtains the right to acquire,  beneficial
ownership of 15 percent or more of the  outstanding  Common Stock of the Company
or (2) commences,  or intends to commence, a tender or exchange offer that would
result in the beneficial ownership by such person or group of 15 percent or more
of the  outstanding  Common Stock of the Company.  The Rights Plan is similar to
those  adopted by over 1,500 United States  corporations,  including at least 65
electric  and gas  utility  companies.  An  explanation  of the Rights  Plan was
provided to all shareholders at the time of its adoption in July 1996.

     The proponent  asserts that the Rights Plan makes it more  difficult for an
outside  concern to acquire  Minnesota  Power  Common  Stock at a premium  price
because it could not go directly to the  shareholders  with a tender offer.  The
Rights Plan does not  prohibit a tender  offer,  but does  encourage a potential
acquiror to negotiate  directly with the Board.  The purpose of encouraging  the
outsider  to  negotiate  with  the  Board is to  ensure  that an  acquiror  pays
Minnesota Power shareholders a premium reflecting the full value of the Company.
The Board is in a stronger position than individual  shareholders to negotiate a
price  that  maximizes  the  value  for all of the  Company's  shareholders.  By
creating  inducements for a potential  acquiror to negotiate with the Board, the
Rights Plan creates an orderly process that allows the Board  sufficient time to
evaluate  whether  a  takeover  offer  is  beneficial  to all  of the  Company's
shareholders,  while retaining the Board's  flexibility to develop  alternatives
that may  result  in  greater  value  for the  Company's  shareholders.  A basic
objective of the Rights Plan is to encourage potential acquirors to come forward
with a sound  offer at the  earliest  possible  time and to  negotiate  with the
Board. It is well recognized that the price an acquiror is ultimately willing to
pay

                                       22

for a company's  stock can far exceed the initial  offer,  especially  when the
acquiror must  negotiate  with the company's  board of directors.

     The Company's  Rights Plan is  administered by and under the control of the
Minnesota  Power Board of  Directors.  Eleven of the  Company's  twelve  current
directors are neither employees nor officers of the Company. The Board possesses
a broad range of  experience  in  business,  finance and law. In the event of an
offer that is in the best interests of the shareholders,  the Board would have a
fiduciary  obligation  to redeem the Rights to permit the offer to proceed.  The
Board is  knowledgeable  of its  fiduciary  duty to represent  the  interests of
shareholders when evaluating the merits of any acquisition proposal.

     The Board  believes  that the proper  time to  consider  redemption  of the
Rights is when a specific  offer is made to acquire the Company's  Common Stock.
Redemption  of the  Rights  prior  to  that  time  would  expose  the  Company's
shareholders to abusive takeover tactics, remove any incentive for the potential
acquiror  to approach  the Board,  and deprive the Board of the time to evaluate
any third party offer and  maximize  value for all  shareholders  of the Company
either through negotiations or development of alternatives.

     The  Board  of  Directors  unanimously  recommends  a vote  "AGAINST"  this
shareholder  proposal.  The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present and
entitled to vote will be required for approval of this shareholder proposal.
