Dear Shareholder:

         We cordially invite you to attend Minnesota Power's 1996 Annual Meeting
of  Shareholders  on Tuesday,  May 14, 1996 at 2 p.m. in the  auditorium  at the
Duluth  Entertainment  Convention  Center  (DECC).  The DECC is  located  on the
waterfront  at 350 Harbor  Drive in Duluth.  Free  parking is  available  in the
adjoining lot. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we encourage you to attend.

         This year there are 14 nominees  standing for election to the Board.
Two members of the Board,  Sister  Kathleen  Hofer and Charles  Russell,  will
not stand for reelection. We thank them for their contributions to the success
of the Company. We are pleased to have  standing for  election,  for the first 
time,  D. Michael Hockett,  Jack R. Kelly,  Jr., and George L. Mayer.  Mr. 
Hockett is Chairman and CEO of ADESA Corporation,  our new automobile auction 
subsidiary.  Mr. Kelly was Chairman of ADESA until it joined  Minnesota Power 
last July. He continues to be a valued  advisor to ADESA,  serving on its board 
of  directors.  Mr.  Mayer,  a seasoned  real estate  investor and manager, 
will  contribute  to the Company's ongoing real estate investment strategy.

         We  recommend  for your  approval  the  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
Compensation Plan and the Director Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan. The plans are
designed to more closely link the interest of Directors and  management to those
of our shareholders.

         It is important that your shares be represented at the Annual  Meeting.
At your earliest  convenience,  please sign,  date,  and mail the enclosed proxy
card in the envelope provided.

        Prior to our Annual  Meeting  this  year,  you  will  have  a  special
opportunity  to learn more about the newest  member of Minnesota  Power's  team,
ADESA Corporation. Key members of ADESA management will be on hand with displays
and  information  booths  describing  ADESA's  many  services to the  automotive
industry.  As a special  plus,  the ADESA  team will  conduct a live  automobile
auction,  with  licensed  car dealers  selling  and  bidding on cars.  The ADESA
management  team will make  presentations  and answer your  questions over a box
lunch. Visit with the car dealers as well. This program will be very informative
and fun. Review the enclosed information and, if you plan to participate, please
fill out the enclosed reply card and return it with your proxy.

         A summary of the  Annual  Meeting  proceedings  will be mailed in early
June to all shareholders.

         Thank you for your continued support.  We look forward to seeing you in
May.

Sincerely,


Arend J. Sandbulte                        Edwin L. Russell

                   ITEM NO. 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The  Board  expects  that all of the  nominees  will be  available  for
election. In the event, however, that any of them should become unavailable,  it
is intended that the proxy would be voted for a nominee or nominees who would be
designated  by the Board,  unless  the Board  reduces  the  number of  directors
serving on the Board.

         In connection  with its  acquisition of ADESA in July 1995, the Company
appointed  Mr.  Hockett as a director,  effective  July 26, 1995,  and agreed to
nominate  Mr.  Hockett (or an  alternate  nominee  selected by a majority of the

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

ADESA Relationships

         On  December  19, 1995 ADESA  Corporation,  the  Company's  subsidiary,
purchased  Eagle  Investments  II, LLC  (Eagle),  an Indiana  limited  liability
company, from five members of the ADESA Corporation's Executive Management team,
including Mr. Hockett,  ADESA's Chairman and CEO, who owned 90 percent of Eagle.
Eagle's only asset was a jet aircraft  which was to be used by ADESA in managing
its  growing  number of auction  sites.  ADESA  paid  Eagle  $99,000 as the cash
purchase price for these interests.  An additional $1,814,795,  representing the
principal and interest owing on a Note held by Bank One, N.A., Indianapolis, was
paid to Eagle and the jet  aircraft is now owned free and clear of liens.  Eagle
paid  $1,881,318 for the aircraft,  license,  and other  associated  acquisition
costs on July 11, 1995,  and invested  $52,216 in the aircraft for  improvements
and maintenance. Upon subsequent evaluation, it was determined that ownership of
a jet  aircraft  would  no  longer  be  necessary,  and  ADESA  has now sold the
aircraft.

         ADESA leases space on an annual basis for its  principal  offices in an
office building located at 1919 S. Post Road,  Indianapolis,  Indiana, from CIL,
Inc., an entity that is wholly owned by Mr. Hockett.  ADESA paid an aggregate of
$148,488 in lease  payments to CIL during  1995.  Management  believes  that the
terms of the lease are  comparable to terms that could be obtained by ADESA from
unrelated parties for comparable rental property.  As specified under a services
agreement  with CIL,  ADESA  received  $19,200  in fees  from CIL for  providing
certain  general and  administrative  services to CIL.  ADESA had an outstanding
receivable from CIL at December 31, 1995 of $95,541 arising from the purchase of
automobiles at  ADESA-Indianapolis  and certain  construction  costs incurred by
ADESA at 1919 S. Post Road, Indianapolis, Indiana which were to be reimbursed by
CIL. Such receivables were paid in the normal course of business.

         Mr.  Hockett and Mr. Dave Hill,  a director  and  executive  officer of
ADESA, and Mr. Hill's son own an automobile  dealership that has participated as
a seller and a buyer at certain of ADESA's auction facilities.  In addition, Mr.
Hockett,  Mr. Hill, and Mr. Larry Wechter,  a director and executive  officer of
ADESA, are directors and officers of the corporation which owns such dealership.
Such  dealership  settles  its  accounts  on the same  terms as any  third-party
customer at ADESA auctions,  and, in the ordinary course,  ADESA had outstanding
receivables from the dealership of $95,231 at December 31, 1995 representing the
unremitted  purchase  price of  automobiles  purchased  at  auction  which  were
remitted by ADESA to the sellers net of ADESA's fees. Such receivables were paid
in the  normal  course of  business.  The  dealership  paid fees to ADESA in the
aggregate of $21,610 during 1995 for use of auction facilities.

Other Relationships

         Robert S. Mars, Jr., who retired from the Board of Directors  effective
May 9, 1995, is Chairman of W.P.& R.S. Mars Company, an industrial equipment and
supply firm. In the normal course of business  through May 9 in 1995 the Company
and its subsidiaries  purchased  $86,737 worth of tools,  equipment,  and repair
services from Mars Company. Some of these tools, equipment,  and repair services
were purchased  pursuant to competitive bids, and others were purchased directly
from inventory of the company as required. It is the opinion of the Company that
such  purchases  were made at prices that were  competitive  with others in this
area.

</TABLE>

         Retirement  benefit  amounts  shown are in the form of a  straight-life
annuity  to the  employee  and  are  based  on  amounts  listed  in the  Summary
Compensation  Table  under the  headings  Salary and Bonus.  Retirement  benefit
amounts  shown are not  subject to any  deduction  for Social  Security or other
offset  amounts.  The  Retirement  Plan  provides  that the  benefit  amount  at
retirement  is subject to  adjustment  in future years to reflect cost of living
increases  to a maximum  adjustment  of 3 percent per year.  As of December  31,
1995,  the executive  officers named in the Summary  Compensation  Table had the
following number of years of credited service under the plan:

    Arend J. Sandbulte       31 years        Donnie R. Crandell      14 years
    Jack R. McDonald         28 years        David G. Gartzke        20 years
    Robert D. Edwards        19 years

         With certain exceptions, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(Code)  presently  restricts the aggregate amount of annual pension which may be
paid to an employee  under the  Retirement  Plan to  $120,000,  which  amount is

                                       11
<PAGE>

subject to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living  increases.  The
Company's  Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan  provides for  supplemental
payments by the Company to eligible executives (including the executive officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table) in amounts sufficient to maintain total
retirement benefits upon retirement at a level which would have been provided by
the Retirement Plan if benefits were not restricted by the Code.

Compensation of Directors

         Employee  directors  receive  no  additional   compensation  for  their
services  as  directors.  In 1995,  the  Company  paid each  director  an annual
retainer  fee of $5,000  and 500 shares of Common  Stock  under the terms of the
Company's Director Stock Plan. In addition, each director was paid $850 for each
Board,  Committee,  and subsidiary board meeting attended,  except that $500 was
paid for  attendance at a second  meeting held the same day as another  meeting.
Each director who is the Chairman of a Committee received an additional $150 for
each  Committee  meeting  attended.  A $250  fee was paid  for  conference  call
meetings.  Directors  may  elect to defer all or a part of the cash  portion  of
their  retainer  fees and  meeting  fees.  The  shares of Common  Stock  paid to
directors  during  1995 had an average  market  price of $26.13  per share.  The
Company also provides  life  insurance of $5,000 on the life of each director at
an aggregate cost to the Company of $938 in 1995.

         The Board has a Long-Term  Incentive Plan which provides a compensation
program  similar to that  provided to the  executive  officers by the  Long-Term
Incentive  Plan (as described in the  Executive  Compensation  Committee  Report
below),  except that the directors'  maximum award  opportunity is 600 shares of
Common Stock every other year. The plan awards Common Stock to the directors if,
over a four-year  period  commencing  with each even  numbered  year,  the total
return to the Company's  shareholders  (that is, stock price  appreciation  plus
reinvested  dividends)  ranks at or above the 55th  percentile of a pre-selected
group of ten comparable utilities or above the 40th percentile of the Standard &
Poor's 500 (S&P 500). The size of the award varies  depending upon the extent to
which the Company's total return exceeds the above total returns. No awards were
paid to directors for the four-year  period ending December 31, 1995 because the
Company's stock performance was below both threshold total returns.

         Effective  January 1, 1996,  directors will receive automatic grants of
stock options every year and performance shares every other year pursuant to the
new  Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive  Plan,  which is being  presented  to
shareholders  for  approval at this Annual  Meeting  and which is  described  in
greater detail later in this Proxy Statement.  Awards of stock under the current
Long-Term  Incentive  Plan will no longer be made  after the end of the  current
four-year performance period (1994 - 1997).

Employment Contracts

         The Company  entered into employment  agreements  effective May 1, 1995
with Robert D.  Edwards and David G. Gartzke in which each  executive  agreed to
remain an employee of the Company  through May 31, 1998 at an annual base salary
that is not less than his respective 1995 base salary.

Report of Board Executive Compensation Committee on Executive Compensation

         Described  below  are  the  compensation   policies  of  the  Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors effective for 1995 with respect
to the  executive  officers of the  Company.  Composed  entirely of  independent
outside  directors,  the Executive  Compensation  Committee is  responsible  for
recommending  to the Board the policies which govern the executive  compensation
program of the  Company  and for  administering  those  policies.  To assist the
Executive  Compensation  Committee in connection  with the  performance  of such
responsibilities  for 1995, the Board retained the services of Hewitt Associates
LLC, a benefits and compensation consulting firm. Hewitt Associates has been
retained in this capacity since 1986.

         The role of the executive  compensation  program is to help the Company
achieve  its  corporate  goals by  motivating  performance,  rewarding  positive
results,  and encouraging  teamwork.  Recognizing  that the potential  impact an
individual  employee has on the attainment of corporate  goals tends to increase
at higher levels within the Company, the executive compensation program provides
greater  variability in compensating  individuals  based on results  achieved as
their  levels  within the Company  rise.  In other words,  individuals  with the
greatest potential impact on achieving the stated goals have the greatest amount
to gain when goals are achieved  and the greatest  amount at risk when goals are
not achieved.

         The  program  also  recognizes  that,  in order to  attract  and retain
exceptional  executive talent,  compensation must be competitive in the national
market when  measured  against  comparable  firms within that market.  For those
executives engaged primarily or exclusively in electric operations, the relevant
market for purposes of comparison is other  electric  utilities  throughout  the
country  which,  on average,  are  comparable in size to the Company.  For those
executives engaged  substantially in the Company's  diversification  activities,
the  appropriate  market for  purposes  of  comparison  includes  both  electric
utilities and general  industry.  Comparisons  with the general  industry market
allow  recognition  of  skills  required  in   diversification   activities  and
compensation levels of executives in other industries.

         To determine  market levels of compensation  for executive  officers in
1995, the Executive Compensation  Committee relied upon comparative  information
provided by Hewitt  Associates,  based on the same 15 electric  utilities and 25
industrial  companies  previously  selected  by Hewitt  Associates  and used for

                                       13
<PAGE>

comparison  purposes  for the  past  seven  years.  The  Executive  Compensation
Committee believes that these companies are appropriate for market  compensation
comparison,  primarily  because  they are  approximately  the  same  size as the
Company as measured by sales revenue.

         The Executive  Compensation  Committee  determined  that executive base
salary plus additional performance-based compensation at the target level should
approximate   the   midpoint   of  the   range  of  base   salary   plus   total
performance-based compensation in the appropriate market. Executive compensation
actually  paid by the Company for 1995 fell within the  mid-range  of  executive
compensation paid by the comparable companies.

         Since  compensation  has  remained  well  below  amounts  that would be
affected by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the
Company  had no  policy  in  1995  regarding  the  deductibility  of  qualifying
compensation paid to executive officers under that section.

         As  described  below,  executive  officers  of the  Company  receive  a
compensation  package  which  consists  of four  basic  elements:  base  salary,
performance-based    compensation,    supplemental   executive   benefits,   and
perquisites.

Base Salary

         Base  salaries  are set at a level  so  that,  if the  target  level of
performance is achieved under the  performance-based  plans as described  below,
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of the
performance-based  compensation  plans,  will be near  the  midpoint  of  market
compensation as described in the preceding four paragraphs. Base salaries of the
executive  officers  (not  including  the CEO) were  increased on average by 5.2
percent in 1995, reflecting market adjustments and merit increases.

Performance-Based Compensation

         Performance goals are approved in advance by the Executive Compensation
Committee   and  the   Board.   A  target   level  of   performance   under  the
performance-based plans represents performance that is either consistent with or
above budget,  or represents  average  performance as measured  against the peer
group described below. With target performance,  executive  compensation will be
near the midpoint of the relevant market.  If no performance  awards are earned,
compensation  of  the  Company's  executive  officers  will  be  near  the  40th
percentile of the market, while performance at increments above the target level
will result in total compensation above the midpoint of the market.

         The Company's performance-based compensation plans include:

     -   Results  Sharing.  The Results Sharing award opportunity rewards annual
         performance of the executive's  responsibility  area as well as overall
         corporate  performance.  Results  Sharing  awards are  available to all
         employees on the
 
                                       14
<PAGE>

         same  percentage  of pay  basis  and are  intended  to  focus  employee
         attention  on  both   responsibility  area  performance  and  corporate
         performance  generally.  Target  performance will result in an award of
         2.5 percent of base salary. Results Sharing awards equaling 7.3 percent
         of base salary were earned by executive  officers and  employees in the
         MP-Electric  business  unit in 1995 because  MP-Electric  substantially
         exceeded its operating  income  budget and achieved its other  business
         unit  goals.  Awards  averaging  5.7 percent of base pay were earned by
         executive  officers and employees in the  corporate  business unit as a
         result of superior operating income achieved by MP-Electric.

     -   Annual  Incentive  Plan. The Annual Incentive Plan is intended to focus
         executive   attention  on  superior   performance  of  the  Company  in
         comparison  to other  companies.  The  Annual  Incentive  Plan  rewards
         near-term corporate performance as measured by the Company's ranking in
         relation  to  (i) a  peer  group  of  ten  electric  utility  companies
         operating in the same geographic  region as the Company (Upper Midwest)
         selected by Hewitt Associates, and (ii) the companies listed in the S&P
         500 Index. The full award opportunity is earned if Company  performance
         equals or exceeds the 90th percentile for all performance measures when
         measured  against  performance of both the peer group utilities and the
         S&P 500  companies.  The target level of performance is achieved if the
         Company's  performance is at the 60th percentile.  At the target level,
         the  executive  officers  (not  including  the CEO) would  earn  awards
         ranging from 15 percent to 24 percent of base salary depending on their
         level of  responsibility.  At the target  level,  the CEO would earn an
         award of 36  percent of his base  salary.  Based on 1995  results,  the
         executive officers (not including the CEO) earned awards averaging 15.6
         percent of base salary under this plan.  This award  resulted  from the
         MP-Electric  business unit achieving maximum performance under the plan
         with respect to its operating income goal, the Company  achieving below
         target  performance  with respect to its  earnings per share goal,  and
         total  shareholder  return  performance  at the  64th  percentile  when
         compared to the peer group of 10 utilities.

         In addition to the foregoing, strategic goals were established pursuant
         to the plan by the Executive  Compensation Committee for each executive
         officer named in the Summary  Compensation Table. These goals relate to
         the performance of the business unit within the scope of responsibility
         of each officer.  Each executive officer (not including the CEO) may be
         awarded up to 10  percent  of base  salary,  though  higher  awards may
         result from  superior  earnings  performance  of the business  unit for
         which the officer is responsible.  Target  performance  would result in
         payment of an award equal to 4 percent of base  salary.  The CEO may be
         awarded up to 15 percent of his salary, with a target of 6 percent. The
         executive officer  responsible for MP-Electric
 

                                       15
<PAGE>

         achieved an award equal to 25 percent of base salary as determined by a
         formula setting the size of his award based on operating  income of MP-
         Electric.  The other three  executive  officers (not including the CEO)
         received  awards in the range of 9 percent to 10 percent of base salary
         for achieving strategic and earnings goals in their respective areas of
         responsibility.

     -   Long-Term  Incentive  Plan.  The  Long-Term  Incentive Plan is designed
         to motivate long-term strategic planning and reward long-term corporate
         performance,  as measured by total  shareholder  return.  In January of
         each year the executive  officers are given a maximum award opportunity
         of a stated number of shares of the  Company's  Common Stock based upon
         the Company's  performance over a four-year  performance period.  Sixty
         percent of the award  opportunity is based upon rank among a peer group
         of ten utilities operating in the same geographic region as the Company
         (Upper Midwest), and forty percent of the award opportunity is based on
         rank among the S&P 500 companies.  For the four-year performance period
         ending  December  31, 1995,  the maximum  award  opportunity  was 6,000
         shares for the CEO. The maximum award ranged from 1,500 to 5,000 shares
         for the other  executive  officers.  The maximum award  opportunity  is
         earned if the Company ranks first or second in the peer group and at or
         above the 90th percentile among the S&P 500 companies. The Company must
         achieve  at  least a 55th  percentile  ranking  among a peer  group  of
         utilities or a 40th percentile  ranking among the S&P 500 companies for
         any award to be earned.  For the  four-year  performance  period ending
         December  31, 1995,  no awards were earned  because the Company did not
         achieve total shareholder return required for a payout under the plan.

Supplemental Executive Benefits

         The Company has  established a Supplemental  Executive  Retirement Plan
(SERP) to treat  employees,  including  the  executive  officers,  equitably  by
replacing  benefits not provided by the Company's  Flexible Benefit Plan and the
Employee Stock  Ownership Plan due to  government-imposed  limits and to provide
retirement benefits which are competitive with those offered by other businesses
with which the Company  competes for managerial  talent.  The SERP also provides
employees whose salaries exceed the salary  limitations for tax-qualified  plans
imposed by the Code with additional benefits such that they receive in aggregate
the benefits they would have been entitled to receive had such  limitations  not
been imposed.

         The  Company  has  also  adopted  Executive  Investment  Plans  whereby
executive  officers may enter into  agreements  with the Company to  irrevocably
defer a portion  of their  compensation  until  after  termination  of  service,
retirement,  or death. The Executive Investment Plans are non-qualified deferred
compensation   plans,   under  which   benefits   result  wholly  from  deferred
compensation.

Perquisites

         The Company provides various  perquisites to assist selected  executive
officers  in  fulfilling  their  business   responsibilities   in  a  cost  and
time efficient  manner,  to the  extent  they are  consistent  with  competitive
practice.  Perquisites  provided by the Company to the named executive  officers
did not exceed the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the total salary and bonus
shown for them in the Summary  Compensation  Table. The perquisites  provided by
the Company were reviewed by the Executive Compensation Committee and determined
to be reasonable and in line with electric utility companies of comparable size.

Chief Executive Officer Compensation
         
         Effective June 1, 1995, the Executive  Compensation Committee increased
Mr.  Sandbulte's  (CEO in 1995)  base  salary  by 5.7  percent  to  reflect  his
contributions to the Company.  Under the Company's Results Sharing Plan, the CEO
was awarded  $21,226,  or 5.7 percent of his base  salary,  because  MP-Electric
achieved  operating income well above its budget and achieved its other business
unit goals.  Under the Annual Incentive Plan, the CEO earned  $112,788,  or 29.7
percent of base salary in 1995 because the  MP-Electric  business  unit achieved
maximum  performance  under the plan with respect to its operating  income goal,
the Company  achieved below target  performance with respect to its earnings per
share,  and total  shareholder  return  performance at the 64th  percentile when
compared  to a peer  group of ten  electric  utility  companies.  Also under the
Annual  Incentive Plan, the CEO was awarded  $57,000,  or 15 percent of his base
salary,  for  accomplishing  Individual  Strategic  Goals assigned to him by the
Executive  Compensation  Committee,  which  included  consummation  of the ADESA
acquisition  and  successfully  guiding the transition by ADESA to membership on
the Minnesota Power team, and successfully  executing the management  succession
plan  adopted  by the  Board.  No award was  earned in 1995 by the CEO under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan because the Company did not achieve the threshold total
shareholder return required for payout under the plan.

- -    Norwest Bank Relationships. Director Charles A. Russell, who, by reason of
     his  retirement,  is not standing for reelection to the Board of Directors,
     retired as  Chairman  and CEO of Norwest  Bank  Minnesota North,  N.A. on
     December 31, 1995.  Norwest has loan commitments under which the Company is
     required to pay certain fees or maintain  compensating  balances,  although
     during 1995 Norwest did not hold notes of the Company for loans pursuant to
     these  arrangements.  Additionally,  Reach  All  Partnership,  in which the
     Company held an 82 1/2 percent ownership interest through its subsidiaries,
     had a secured  working capital line of credit with Norwest under which $3.8
     million was  outstanding,  with  interest  payable at prime rate plus 2 1/2
     percent per annum.  Principal and interest due under this loan were paid in
     full during October 1995 in connection  with the termination of Reach All's
     operations.  Reach All's financial  arrangements  with Norwest were entered
     into before the Company  purchased its ownership  interest in Reach All. It
     is the opinion of management  that these financial  arrangements  reflected
     market rates.

- -    LAREX Economic  Development Project. In 1995 the Company began developing
     plans for an energy  park to be located  on its  property  adjacent  to its
     Boswell Energy Center in Cohasset,  MN. The first tenant of the energy park
     will be LAREX International, Inc. LAREX developed a process to extract from
     certain  tree species a substance  that is used in a variety of  commercial
     applications. The Company, through a subsidiary, entered into a contract to
     pay M. A. Mortenson  Company $1.7 million for construction of the buildings
     to be occupied by LAREX,  and agreed to lease these buildings to LAREX. The
     Iron Range Rehabilitation and Redevelopment Board (IRRRB), a local economic
     development agency, has agreed to purchase the buildings from the Company's
     subsidiary   when  LAREX   occupies  the  building   upon   completion   of
     construction,  for an  amount  equal to the cost of  construction,  and the
     subsidiary  will then assign the building lease to the IRRRB.  Construction
     is  expected to be  complete  in May 1996.  The  Company  will enter into a
     separate ground lease with LAREX at an economic  development rate which the
     Company will offer to other  tenants of the energy park. It is expected the
     Company  will also  provide  financing  to LAREX in the amount of  $200,000
     under the customary terms of the Company's  Economic  Development  Program.
     This financing will be used to purchase equipment in which the Company will
     retain a security  interest.  LAREX is expected to provide quality jobs and
     represents an important first step in the development of the energy park.

     LAREX was founded in 1993 by Medical  Innovation Fund II of Minneapolis and
     Northeast  Ventures of Duluth. To date,  LAREX's owners have invested $3.25
     million in LAREX as follows:  Medical  Innovation Fund II has invested $2.5
     million  and  holds  58.5  percent  of  all  stock  currently  outstanding;
     Northeast  Ventures  has  invested  $750,000  and holds 18  percent  of the
     currently issued and outstanding  stock;  and the remaining  investment and
     stock is held by various  employees of LAREX. In addition to the foregoing,
     in return for an investment of 

                                       18
<PAGE>
     approximately $1 million,  LAREX has issued Kolya Management  Company (i) a
     promissory note convertible into LAREX stock with market value equal to the
     face value of the note at the time of LAREX's next stock  offering and (ii)
     a warrant giving Kolya the right to purchase,  at market value,  additional
     stock of LAREX with an aggregate  value of  approximately  $500,000.  Also,
     Northeast  Ventures  invested an additional  $250,000 in LAREX receiving in
     return a note and warrants  with the same terms  described in the preceding
     sentence.

     Minnesota  Power Director Robert  Nickoloff  serves as a General Partner of
     Medical Innovation Partners II, possessing a 20 percent ownership interest.
     Medical Innovation Partners II is the general partner of Medical Innovation
     Fund II. In addition,  Mr.  Nickoloff  serves on the boards of directors of
     Northeast Ventures and LAREX.  Northeast Ventures is a $7.8 million venture
     capital fund investing in northeastern Minnesota. Minnesota Power purchased
     a 21 percent  interest in  Northeast  Ventures  for $1 million in 1989 at a
     time when  there  were no  relationships  between  Northeast  Ventures  and
     Minnesota Power or its Directors or employees.  Minnesota Power invested in
     Northeast Ventures as an economic  development  contribution and has agreed
     that it would not withdraw its investment.  Mr. Gregory Sandbulte,  the son
     of Minnesota  Power Chairman  Arend  Sandbulte,  is currently  president of
     Northeast Ventures.  Mr. Nick Smith serves as chairman and CEO of Northeast
     Ventures,  and is a member  of the  Minnesota  Power  and  LAREX  boards of
     directors.  Geraldine R.  VanTassel,  Vice  President - Corporate  Resource
     Planning of  Minnesota  Power,  is a director of  Northeast  Ventures.  Mr.
     Gregory  Sandbulte  and Mr.  Smith,  along with a third party,  are general
     partners in Kolya  Management  Company,  holding a five  percent  ownership
     interest. Mr. Bo Nickoloff, the son of Mr. Robert Nickoloff, is an employee
     of LAREX.

              ITEM NO. 2 - APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The  Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  has
recommended the appointment of Price  Waterhouse as independent  accountants for
the Company for the year 1996.  Price  Waterhouse has acted in the same capacity
since October 1963.

         A  representative  of the accounting firm will be present at the Annual
Meeting of  Shareholders,  will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or
she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

         In  connection  with the 1995  audit,  Price  Waterhouse  reviewed  the
Company's annual report, examined the related financial statements, and reviewed
interim  financial  statements  and certain of the  Company's  filings  with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The Board of Directors recommends a vote in favor of the appointment of
Price Waterhouse as the Company's independent accountants for 1996.

                    ITEM NO. 3 - RECOMMENDED APPROVAL OF THE
                                 MINNESOTA POWER
                 EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         At its  meeting  on  January 22 and 23,  1996,  the Board of  Directors
adopted the Minnesota  Power Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan
(Plan),  subject to approval by the shareholders.  The following is a summary of
the material features of the Plan.

         The Plan is intended to replace the existing Long-Term  Incentive Plan,
which has four-year  performance periods, the last of which will end on December
31, 1998.

         A vote in favor of the Plan will be  deemed  also to be a vote in favor
of the performance goals as set forth in the Plan.

Purpose of the Plan

         The purpose of the Plan is to promote the success and enhance the value
of the Company by linking  participants'  personal interests to those of Company
shareholders  and  customers,  providing  participants  with  an  incentive  for
outstanding  performance.  The Plan is further intended to assist the Company in
its ability to motivate,  attract and retain the services of  participants  upon
whom the successful conduct of its operations is largely dependent.

Effective Date and Duration

         The Plan became  effective  on January 1, 1996,  subject to approval by
the shareholders,  and shall remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board
of Directors to terminate the Plan at any time,  until all shares subject to the
Plan shall have been purchased or acquired. No grants may be made under the Plan
after the tenth anniversary of the effective date.

Amendments

          The  Board  may,  at any  time and from  time to time,  alter,  amend,
suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part;  provided,  however,  that no
amendment which requires  shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue
to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
(Exchange Act) shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders.

Administration of the Plan

         The Plan will be administered by the Executive  Compensation  Committee
of the Board of Directors (which consists  exclusively of outside  directors) or
by  such  other  committee  (Committee)   consisting  of  not  less  than  three
non-employee directors appointed by the Board of Directors.  The Committee will,
to  the  extent  necessary,  be  comprised  solely  of  directors  qualified  to
administer  the Plan pursuant to Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and Treas.  Reg.
Section 1.162-27(e)(3)  with  respect  to grants  made to  certain key executive
officers  (Key  Executives).  Compliance  with  this  requirement  is one of the
factors necessary to enable the

                                       21

<PAGE>

Company to avoid the income tax deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of
the Code (Section 162(m) Limitations) on annual compensation in excess of
$1,000,000.

Shares Subject to the Plan

         The Plan  authorizes  the grant of up to 2,100,000  shares of Minnesota
Power Common Stock.  Shares  underlying  grants that lapse, are forfeited or are
not paid in  stock  may be  reused  for  subsequent  grants.  Shares  may be (i)
authorized but unissued  shares of Common Stock or (ii) shares  purchased on the
open market.  The market  value of Company  Common Stock as of March 1, 1996 was
$27.625.

         If any  corporate  transaction  occurs  that  causes  a  change  in the
capitalization  of the  Company,  the  Committee  is  authorized  to  make  such
adjustments to the number and class of shares of stock delivered, and the number
and class and/or price of shares of Common Stock subject to  outstanding  grants
made under the Plan, as it deems  appropriate and equitable to prevent  dilution
or enlargement of participants' rights.

Eligibility and Participation

         Employees  eligible to participate in the Plan include officers and key
employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries,  as determined by the Committee,
including  employees  who are members of the Board of  Directors,  but excluding
directors who are not employees.  It is anticipated that the approximate  number
of employees who will be eligible  initially to participate  under the Plan will
be at least 100.

Grants under the Plan

Stock Options

         The Committee may grant incentive  stock options  (ISOs),  nonqualified
stock options or a combination thereof under the Plan. The option price for each
such grant  shall be the  closing  sale  price of  Company  stock on the date of
grant.  Options  shall expire at such times as the  Committee  determines at the
time of grant; provided, however, that no option shall be exercisable later than
the tenth anniversary of its grant.  Simultaneously with the grant of an option,
a participant may receive dividend equivalents, which entitle the participant to
a right to receive the value of the dividends paid with respect to the number of
shares  held under  option from the date of grant to the date of  exercise.  The
Committee will determine at the time that dividend  equivalents  are granted the
conditions,  if any,  to which  the  payment  of such  dividend  equivalents  is
subject.

         Options  granted under the Plan shall be  exercisable at such times and
subject to such  restrictions  and  conditions as the Committee  shall  approve;
provided that no option may be exercisable prior to six (6) months following its
grant.  The option  exercise price is payable in cash, in shares of Common Stock
of the Company having a fair market value equal to the exercise  price, by share
withholding or in a combination of the foregoing. The Committee may allow, along
with other means of exercise,  cashless  exercise as permitted under the Federal
Reserve Board's Regulation T, subject to the applicable securities laws.


                                       22
<PAGE>

Stock Appreciation Rights

         Stock  Appreciation  Rights (SARs) granted under the Plan may be in the
form of freestanding SARs, tandem SARs or a combination  thereof. The base value
of a  freestanding  SAR shall be equal to the  closing  sale price of a share of
Company Common Stock on the date of grant.  The base value of a tandem SAR shall
be equal to the option  price of the related  option.  No SAR granted  under the
Plan may be exercisable prior to six (6) months following its grant. The term of
any SAR granted under the Plan shall be determined  by the  Committee,  provided
that such term may not exceed ten (10) years.

         Freestanding  SARs may be exercised  upon such terms and  conditions as
are imposed by the Committee and set forth in the SAR grant agreement.  A tandem
SAR may be  exercised  only with  respect to the  shares of Common  Stock of the
Company for which its related option is exercisable.

         Upon exercise of an SAR, a  participant  will receive the excess of the
fair  market  value of a share of Company  Common  Stock on the date of exercise
over the base value multiplied by the number of shares with respect to which the
SAR is exercised.  Payment due to the  participant  upon exercise may be made in
cash, in shares of Company Common Stock having a fair market value equal to such
cash  amount,  or in a  combination  of cash and shares,  as  determined  by the
Committee.

         The maximum number of SARs which may be granted to any one  participant
under the Plan in any calendar year is 20,000.

Restricted Stock

         Restricted  stock may be granted in such  amounts  and  subject to such
terms and conditions as determined by the Committee.

         Restricted stock may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned, or
otherwise  alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable  restricted
period;  provided,  however, that in no event may restricted stock granted under
the Plan vest prior to six (6) months following the date of its grant.

         Participants  holding  restricted stock may exercise full voting rights
with respect to those shares during the restricted  period and shall be credited
with regular cash  dividends and other  distributions  paid with respect to such
shares.  Subject to the Committee's right to determine  otherwise at the time of
grant, dividends or distributions credited during the restricted period shall be
subject to the same restrictions on  transferability  and  forfeitability as the
shares of restricted  stock with respect to which they were paid.  All dividends
credited shall be paid promptly following the vesting of the share of restricted
stock to which such dividends or other distributions relate.
 
Performance Units and Performance Shares

         Performance units and performance  shares may be granted in the amounts
and subject to such terms and  conditions as determined  by the  Committee.  The


                                       23
<PAGE>

Committee shall set performance goals,  which,  depending on the extent to which
they are met during the performance periods  established by the Committee,  will
determine the number and/or value of performance  units/shares that will be paid
out to  participants.  Performance  periods shall, in all cases, be at least six
(6) months in length.

         Simultaneously  with the grant of performance  shares,  the participant
may be granted dividend  equivalents  with respect to such  performance  shares.
Dividend  equivalents  shall  constitute  rights to be paid amounts equal to the
dividends declared on an equal number of outstanding shares on all payment dates
occurring during the period between the grant date of the performance shares and
the date the performance shares are earned or paid out.

         Participants   shall  receive  payment  of  the  value  of  performance
units/shares  earned after the end of the performance  period,  or at such later
time as the Committee may determine.  Payment of performance  units/shares shall
be made in cash  and/or  shares of Common  Stock  which have an  aggregate  fair
market value equal to the value of the earned performance units/shares after the
end of the applicable  performance  period, in such combination as the Committee
determines.  Such  shares may be  granted  subject  to any  restrictions  deemed
appropriate by the Committee.

         Unless  and until the  Committee  proposes  a change in such  goals for
shareholder  vote or  applicable  tax and/or  securities  laws  change to permit
Committee   discretion  to  alter  such  performance   goals  without  obtaining
shareholder  approval,  to avoid the Section 162(m) Limitations, the performance
goals to be used for  purposes of grants to Key  Executives  shall be based upon
any one or more of the following:

         Total shareholder return (measured as the sum of share appreciation and
         dividends declared). 

         Return on invested capital, assets, or net assets.

         Share earnings/earnings growth.

         Cash flow/cash flow growth.

         Cost of services to consumers.

         Growth in revenues,  sales,  operating income, net income,  stock price
         and/or earnings per share.

         Return on shareholders equity.

         Economic value created.

         Customer  satisfaction  and/or  customer  service  quality.

         Operating effectiveness

         The  maximum  payout  to  any  one  participant  (i)  with  respect  to
performance units granted in any calendar year is 200% of base salary determined
at the  earlier  of the  beginning  of the  performance  period and the time the
performance  goals are set by the Committee and (ii) with respect to performance
shares in any calendar year is 20,000 shares.

Other Grants

         The  Committee  may  make  other  grants  which  may  include,  without
limitation,  the grant of shares of Common  Stock based upon  certain  specified
conditions  and the  payment  of  shares  in lieu of cash  under  other  Company
incentive  or bonus  programs in such manner and at such times as the  Committee
determines.

Termination of Employment

         In  the  event  a  participant's  employment  is  terminated  during  a
performance  period,  before grants become  exercisable or vested, or after they
become  exercisable but before exercise,  the Committee shall determine,  at the
time of grant, participants' rights, if any, with respect to such grants.

Transferability

         Grants may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned or  otherwise
alienated  or  hypothecated,  other than by will or by the laws of  descent  and
distribution.   A  participant's   rights  shall  be  exercisable  only  by  the
participant during his or her lifetime.

Change in Control

         As of the effective date of a change in control,

         (i)      any option or SAR outstanding shall become immediately 
                  exercisable;
         (ii)     any restriction period and restrictions imposed on restricted
                  stock shall be deemed to have expired;
         (iii)    the superior number of performance shares granted for the
                  entire performance period including dividend equivalents 
                  for the entire performance period shall be paid out, in cash
                  or in stock, as determined by the Committee; and

         (iv)     any  earned   performance  units  or  performance  shares  (as
                  increased by any dividend  equivalents to the date of payment)
                  not yet paid out shall be paid out immediately,  in cash or in
                  stock,  as  determined  by the  Committee.  There  shall  not,
                  however, be any accelerated payout with respect to performance
                  grants  made less than six (6)  months  prior to the change in
                  control.

         For purposes of the above,  a change in control of the Company shall be
deemed  to  have  occurred  as of the  first  day  that  any  one or more of the
following events have occurred:
                
         (i)      the dissolution or liquidation of the Company; 
 
                                       25

<PAGE>
 
         (ii)     a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company with
                  one or more unrelated corporations, as a result of which the
                  Company is not the surviving corporation;

         (iii)    the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of shares of
                  the Company Common Stock (or of the shares of the stock of any
                  person that is a  shareholder  of the  Company) in one or more
                  transactions,  related or  unrelated,  to one or more entities
                  unrelated to the Company if, as a result of such transactions,
                  any entity (or any entity and its  affiliates)  owns more than
                  twenty  percent  (20%) of the voting power of the  outstanding
                  Company Common Stock;
                                    
         (iv)     a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company with
                  one or more unrelated  corporations,  if immediately after the
                  consummation of such  transaction  less than a majority of the
                  Board of Directors of the surviving  corporation  is comprised
                  of Continuing  Directors.  Continuing  Director shall mean (i)
                  each member of the Board of Directors  of the  Company,  while
                  such  person  is a member of the  Board,  who is not the other
                  party to the transaction,  an Affiliate or Associate (as these
                  terms are defined in the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as
                  amended)  of  such  other  party  to  the  transaction,  or  a
                  representative of such other party or of any such Affiliate or
                  Associate,  and was a member of the Board immediately prior to
                  the initial public  announcement  of a proposal  relating to a
                  reorganization,  merger or consolidation  involving such other
                  party,  or an  Affiliate  or  Associate of such other party or
                  (ii) any  person  who  subsequently  becomes  a member  of the
                  Board,  while such person is a member of the Board, who is not
                  the  other  party  to  the  transaction,  or an  Affiliate  or
                  Associate thereof,  or a representative of such other party to
                  the transaction or of any such Affiliate or Associate, if such
                  person's  nomination  for election to the Board is recommended
                  or approved by two-thirds of the Continuing  Directors then in
                  office; or

         (v)      the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
                  Company.

         The table reflects the number of stock options and  performance shares
granted pursuant to the Plan on January 2, 1996, subject to approval of the Plan
by the shareholders.

         The  dollar  value of the  stock  options  is  based  on a  combination
Black-Scholes,  binomial  pricing  method.  The stock options vest 50 percent on
January 2, 1997 and 50 percent on January 2, 1998,  are  exercisable  at $28.625
per share, and expire on January 2, 2006. The value of the performance shares is
based on $28.625,  the closing price of Minnesota  Power Common Stock on January
2, 1996.  Performance shares carry dividend  equivalents which add to the number
of shares subject to the grant. Threshold, target, and superior award numbers in
the table reflect dividend  equivalents expected to be accrued over the two year
performance period at the current dividend rate.

         It is contemplated  that additional  grants under the Plan will be made
annually.

Federal Income Tax Consequences

         The following is a brief  description  of the federal tax  consequences
related to options awarded under the Plan.

Consequences to the Optionholder

Grant
- -----

         There are no federal income tax consequences to the optionholder solely
by reason of the grant of ISOs and non-ISOs under the Plan.

Exercise
- --------

         The  exercise  of an ISO is not a  taxable  event for  regular  federal
income tax  purposes  if  certain  requirements  are  satisfied,  including  the
restriction  providing that the optionholder  generally must exercise the option
no  later  than  three  (3)  months  following  the  termination  of  his or her
employment.  However,  such exercise may give rise to an alternative minimum tax
liability (see "Alternative Minimum Tax" below).

         Upon  the  exercise  of a  non-ISO,  the  optionholder  will  generally
recognize  ordinary  income in an amount  equal to the excess of the fair market
value of the shares of Company  Common  Stock at the time of  exercise  over the
amount paid as the exercise price. The ordinary income  recognized in connection
with the exercise by an  optionholder  of a non-ISO will be subject to both wage
and employment tax withholding.

         The  optionholder's  tax basis in the shares  acquired  pursuant to the
exercise of an option will be the amount paid upon exercise plus, in the case of
a non-ISO,  the amount of ordinary income  recognized by the  optionholder  upon
exercise.

                                       28
<PAGE>


Qualifying Disposition
- ----------------------

         If an optionholder  disposes of shares of Company Common Stock acquired
upon the  exercise  of an ISO in a  taxable  transaction,  and such  disposition
occurs more than two years from the date on which the option is granted and more
than one  year  after  the  date on which  the  shares  are  transferred  to the
optionholder  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of the  ISO,  the  optionholder  will
recognize  long-term  capital gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the
amount realized upon such disposition and the  optionholder's  adjusted basis in
such shares (generally the option exercise price).

Disqualifying Disposition
- -------------------------

         If the optionholder disposes of shares of Company Common Stock acquired
upon the exercise of an ISO (other than in certain tax-free transactions) within
two years from the date on which the ISO is granted or within one year after the
transfer of the shares to the optionholder  pursuant to the exercise of the ISO,
then at the  time of  disposition  the  optionholder  will  generally  recognize
ordinary  income  equal to the  lesser of (i) the  excess of such  share's  fair
market  value  on the  date of  exercise  over the  exercise  price  paid by the
optionholder or (ii) the  optionholder's  actual gain (i.e., the excess, if any,
of the amount  realized on the  disposition  over the exercise price paid by the
optionholder).  If the total amount realized on a taxable disposition (including
return of capital and capital gain) exceeds the fair market value on the date of
exercise,  then the optionholder  will recognize a capital gain in the amount of
such excess. If the optionholder  incurs a loss on the disposition (i.e., if the
total amount realized is less than the exercise price paid by the optionholder),
then the loss will be a capital loss.

Other Disposition
- -----------------

         If an optionholder  disposes of shares of Company Common Stock acquired
upon  exercise  of a non-ISO in a taxable  transaction,  the  optionholder  will
recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference  between his
or her  basis  (as  discussed  above) in the  shares  sold and the total  amount
realized upon  disposition.  Any such capital gain or loss (and any capital gain
or loss  recognized on a  disqualifying  disposition of shares of Company Common
Stock  acquired  upon  exercise of ISOs as  discussed  above) will be  long-term
depending on whether the shares of Company  Common Stock were held for more than
one year from the date such shares were transferred to the optionholder.

Alternative Minimum Tax
- -----------------------

         Alternative  minimum tax (AMT) is imposed in  addition  to, but only to
the extent it exceeds,  the  optionholder's  regular  tax for the taxable  year.
Generally,  AMT is  computed  at the rate of 26% on the  excess of a  taxpayer's
alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) over the exemption amount, but only if
such  excess  amount  does not exceed  $175,000  ($87,500 in the case of married

                                       29

<PAGE>

individuals  filing  separate  returns).  The AMT tax rate is 28% of such excess
amount over the $175,000  ($87,500)  amount.  For these purposes,  the exemption
amount is $45,000 for joint returns or returns of surviving spouses ($33,750 for
single taxpayers and $22,500 for married  individuals  filing separate returns),
reduced by 25% of the excess AMTI over  $150,000 for joint returns or returns of
surviving  spouses  ($112,500  for single  taxpayers  and  $75,000  for  married
individuals  filing  separate  returns).  A taxpayer's  AMTI is essentially  the
taxpayer's  taxable income adjusted pursuant to the AMT provisions and increased
by items of tax preference.

         The exercise of ISOs (but not  non-ISOs)  will  generally  result in an
upward  adjustment  to the  optionholder's  AMTI in the year of  exercise  by an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock on the
date of exercise over the exercise price.  The basis of the stock acquired,  for
AMT  purposes,  will equal the  exercise  price  increased  by the prior  upward
adjustment of the taxpayer's  AMTI due to the exercise of the option.  This will
result in a corresponding  downward adjustment to the optionholder's AMTI in the
year the stock is disposed of.

Consequences to the Company

         There are no federal income tax  consequences  to the Company by reason
of the  grant  of  ISOs  or  non-ISOs  or  the  exercise  of  ISOs  (other  than
disqualifying dispositions).

         At the  time  the  optionholder  recognizes  ordinary  income  from the
exercise  of a non-ISO,  the Company  will be  entitled to a federal  income tax
deduction  in the amount of the  ordinary  income so  recognized  (as  described
above),   provided  that  the  Company  satisfies  its  withholding  obligations
described  below. To the extent the optionholder  recognizes  ordinary income by
reason of a  disqualifying  disposition  of the stock  acquired upon exercise of
ISOs, the Company will be entitled to a  corresponding  deduction in the year in
which the disposition occurs. Any deduction to which the Company may be entitled
may be limited by reason of the Section 162(m) Limitations, as described above.

         The Company will be required to report to the Internal  Revenue Service
any ordinary income  recognized by any optionholder by reason of the exercise of
a non-ISO.  The Company will be required to withhold income and employment taxes
(and pay the  employer's  shares of  employment  taxes) with respect to ordinary
income recognized by the optionholder upon the exercise of non-ISOs.

Other Tax Consequences

         The foregoing  discussion is not a complete  description of the federal
income  tax  aspects  of  ISOs  and  non-ISOs   under  the  Plan.  In  addition,
administrative  and judicial  interpretations  of the application of the federal
income tax laws are subject to change.  Furthermore,  the  foregoing  discussion
does not address state or local tax consequences.

                    ITEM NO. 4 - RECOMMENDED APPROVAL OF THE
                                 MINNESOTA POWER
                    DIRECTOR LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         At its  meeting  on  January 22 and 23,  1996,  the Board of  Directors
adopted the Minnesota  Power  Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive Plan (Plan),
subject to  approval  by the  shareholders.  The  following  is a summary of the
material features of the Plan.

         The  Plan is  intended  to  replace  the  existing  Director  Long-Term
Incentive Plan, which has four-year  performance periods, the last of which will
end on December  31,  1997.  The Plan will cover the  performance  share  grants
currently held under the old plan.

         A vote in favor of the Plan will be  deemed  also to be a vote in favor
of the performance  goals set forth in the Plan and a vote in favor of the grant
of  shares  under  the old  Directors'  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan and the goals
relating thereto, all as set forth in the Plan.

Purpose of the Plan

         The purpose of the Plan is to promote the success and enhance the value
of the  Company by linking  directors'  personal  interests  to those of Company
shareholders.  The Plan is further intended to assist the Company in its ability
to  motivate,  attract  and  retain  highly  qualified  individuals  to serve as
directors of the Company.

Effective Date and Duration

         The Plan became  effective  on January 1, 1996,  subject to approval by
the shareholders,  and shall remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board
of Directors to terminate the Plan at any time,  until all shares subject to the
Plan shall have been purchased or acquired. No grants may be made under the Plan
after the tenth anniversary of the effective date.

Amendments

         The Board may, at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend
or terminate the Plan in whole or in part; provided,  however, that no amendment
which requires  shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply
with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act shall be effective unless approved by the
shareholders.  Any provision of the Plan stating the amount, price and timing of
securities to be issued under the Plan shall not be amended more than once every
six months, other than to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue Code, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the rules thereunder.

                                       31
<PAGE>

Administration of the Plan

         The Plan will be administered by a committee (Committee) appointed by
the Board of  Directors  consisting  of not less than three  persons who are not
eligible  to  participate  in the Plan.  Members  of the  Committee  need not be
members of the Board.

Shares Subject to the Plan

         The Plan  authorizes  the grant of up to  150,000  shares of  Minnesota
Power Common Stock.  Shares underlying grants that lapse or are forfeited may be
reused for subsequent  grants.  Shares may be (i) authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock or (ii) shares purchased on the open market. The market value of
Company Common Stock as of March 1, 1996 was $27.625.

         If any  corporate  transaction  occurs  that  causes  a  change  in the
capitalization of the Company,  the Committee shall make such adjustments to the
number and class of shares of stock  delivered,  and the number and class and/or
price of shares of Common  Stock  subject to  outstanding  grants made under the
Plan, as it deems  appropriate and equitable to prevent  dilution or enlargement
of participants' rights.

Eligibility and Participation

         Only non-employee  directors of the Company are eligible to participate
in the  Plan.  The  number  of  directors  who  will be  eligible  initially  to
participate under the Plan will be 12.

Grants under the Plan

Stock Options
- -------------

         On  January  2,  1996  and  on  every  January  2nd  thereafter,   each
non-employee  director of the Company will receive a grant of 725 stock options.
The  exercise  price for each such  grant  shall be the  closing  sale  price of
Company  Common  Stock on the date of grant.  Options  shall expire on the tenth
anniversary of the date of grant.

         Options  granted under the Plan shall be  exercisable  50% on the first
anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining 50% on the second anniversary
of the date of grant. The option exercise price is payable in cash, in shares of
Common  Stock of the Company  having a fair market  value equal to the  exercise
price,  by share  withholding,  cashless  exercise  or in a  combination  of the
foregoing.

Performance Shares
- ------------------
         On January 2, 1996 and on every  second  January 2nd  thereafter,  each
non-employee  director of the Company will receive a grant of performance shares
equal in number to $10,000  divided by the closing sale price of Company  Common
Stock on the date of grant.  Performance  periods shall end on the December 31st
two years after the date of grant.

                                       32
<PAGE>

         The participant shall also receive dividend equivalents with respect to
the number of performance shares subject to the grant. The dividend  equivalents
credited on each Common Stock  ex-dividend  date during the  performance  period
shall be in the form of  additional  performance  shares,  shall be added to the
number of performance  shares subject to the grant and shall equal the number of
shares (including  fractional shares) that could be purchased on the ex-dividend
date,  based  on  the  closing  sale  price  as  reported  in  the  consolidated
transaction  reporting  system on that date, with cash dividends that would have
been paid on performance shares, if such performance shares were shares.

         The performance goal for each performance  period is total  shareholder
return  (defined as stock price  appreciation  plus dividends  reinvested on the
ex-dividend date throughout the performance  period,  divided by the fair market
value of a share at the beginning of the performance  period) for the Company in
comparison to the total shareholder return for the 16 companies set forth in the
Plan over the performance  period. The fair market value of shares is defined as
the closing price as reported on the composite reporting system on the first day
of the performance period.

         No awards will be paid if the  threshold  percentiles  are not reached.
Earned  awards will range from 50% to 200% of the number of  performance  shares
granted (as  increased by the  dividend  equivalents),  based on the  percentile
performance  achieved by the Company.  Straight line  interpolation will be used
for results between those specified, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

         Subject to the provisions for termination or change in control,  50% of
any earned performance  shares (as increased by the dividend  equivalents) shall
be paid after the end of the performance period promptly after  determination of
the extent to which  performance  goals have been met. The  remaining 50% of the
earned  performance  shares (as  increased  by the dividend  equivalents)  shall
continue to accrue dividend  equivalents until paid out as set forth in the next
sentence.  One-

half of the remaining  earned  performance  shares (as increased by the dividend
equivalents) shall be paid out on the next January 2. The remaining  performance
shares shall continue to accrue  dividend  equivalents  and shall be paid out on
the following January 2.

Termination of Director Status

         In the event a  participant  ceases to be a director  of the Company by
reason of retirement or death:

         (i)      before  the  exercise  period  commences  for an  option,  any
                  options  not  yet   exercisable   shall   become   exercisable
                  immediately  and be exercisable in full at any time during the
                  one year period after retirement or death;

         (ii)     after  the  exercise  period  commences  for an  option,  such
                  options  may be  exercised  in full at any time during the one
                  year period after  retirement or death,  but in no event after
                  the exercise period has expired;

         (iii)    during  a  performance  period  for  performance  shares,  the
                  participant  (or  his  or her  beneficiary  or  estate)  shall
                  receive  a  payment  of  any  earned  performance  shares  (as
                  increased   by   dividend    equivalents),    promptly   after
                  determination  of the extent to which  performance  goals have
                  been met. The payout  shall be prorated  based upon the number
                  of months  elapsed  as of the date of  retirement  or death in
                  relation to the full performance period; and

         (iv)     after the end of a performance  period,  but before any or all
                  earned  performance shares have been paid out, the participant
                  (or his or her  beneficiary  or estate) shall be entitled to a
                  full payout of all earned  performance shares (as increased by
                  the dividend equivalents),  which shall be paid promptly after
                  such occurrence.

         Retirement is defined as resignation  upon reaching  retirement age, or
otherwise  resigning  or not standing  for  reelection  with the approval of the
Board.

         In the event a  participant  ceases to be a director of the Company for
any other reason (other than upon a change in control):

         (i)      all options not yet exercisable or exercised shall be 
                  forfeited;

         (ii)     all performance shares and related dividend equivalent not yet
                  earned shall be forfeited; and
 
         (iii)    earned performance shares (as increased by dividend 
                  equivalents) shall continue to accrue dividend equivalents 
                  and shall be paid out as and when provided in Section 7.6 
                  of the Plan.

                                       34

Transferability

         Grants may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned or  otherwise
alienated  or  hypothecated,  other than by will or by the laws of  descent  and
distribution.   A  participant's   rights  shall  be  exercisable  only  by  the
participant during his or her lifetime.

Change in Control

         As of the effective date of a change in control:

         (i)      any options outstanding shall become immediately exercisable;

         (ii)     the  higher of (x) 100% of the  number of  performance  shares
                  granted for the entire  performance  period and (y) the payout
                  based on actual  performance for the performance period ending
                  on the date of the  change in control  (in  either  case after
                  giving effect to the  accumulation  of dividend  equivalents),
                  prorated  to reflect  the number of months in the  performance
                  period up to the date of the change in control in  relation to
                  the full performance period,  shall be paid out immediately in
                  shares; and

         (iii)    all  earned  performance  shares  (as  increased  by  dividend
                  equivalents) not yet paid out shall be paid out immediately in
                  shares.  There shall not, however,  be any accelerated  payout
                  with  respect to  performance  share grants made less than six
                  (6) months prior to the change in control.

         For purposes of the above,  a change in control of the Company shall be
deemed  to  have  occurred  as of the  first  day  that  any  one or more of the
following events have occurred:

         (i)      the dissolution or liquidation of the Company;

         (ii)     a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company with
                  one  or  more  unrelated
                  corporations, as a result of which the Company is not the 
                  surviving corporation;

         (iii)    the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of shares of
                  the Company Common Stock (or of the shares of the stock of any
                  person that is a  shareholder  of the  Company) in one or more
                  transactions,  related or  unrelated,  to one or more entities
                  unrelated to the Company if, as a result of such transactions,
                  any entity (or any entity and its  affiliates)  owns more than
                  twenty  percent  (20%) of the voting power of the  outstanding
                  Company Common Stock; or

         (iv)     the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company.

</TABLE>

         The table reflects the number of stock options and  performance  shares
granted pursuant to the Plan on January 2, 1996, subject to approval of the Plan
by the shareholders.

         The  dollar  value of the  stock  options  is  based  on a  combination
Black-Scholes, binomial pricing method. The stock options vest 50% on January 2,
1997 and 50% on January 2,  1998,  are  exercisable  at $28.625  per share,  and
expire on January 2, 2006.  Performance shares carry dividend  equivalents which
add to the  number  of shares  subject  to the  grant.  Threshold,  target,  and
superior award numbers in the table reflect dividend  equivalents expected to be
accrued over the two year  performance  period at the current dividend rate. The
table also reflects the maximum award number and dollar value of shares  granted
under  the old Plan  for the 1994 - 1997  performance  cycle.  The  value of the
performance  shares and the awards  under the old Plan is based on $28.625,  the
closing price of Minnesota Power Common Stock on January 2, 1996.

         Additional  grants  of  stock  options  will  be  made  annually,   and
additional grants of performance shares will be made every other year.

Federal Income Tax Consequences

         The following is a brief  description  of the federal tax  consequences
related to options awarded under the Plan.

Consequences to the Optionholder

Grant
- -----

         There are no federal income tax consequences to the optionholder solely
by reason of the grant of an option under the Plan.

Exercise
- --------

         Upon  the  exercise  of an  option,  the  optionholder  will  generally
recognize  ordinary  income in an amount  equal to the excess of the fair market
value of the shares of Company  Common  Stock at the time of  exercise  over the
amount paid as the exercise price.

         The  optionholder's  tax basis in the shares  acquired  pursuant to the
exercise of an option will be the amount paid upon  exercise  plus the amount of
ordinary income recognized by the optionholder upon exercise.

Disposition of Shares Acquired Under an Option
- ----------------------------------------------

         If an optionholder  disposes of shares of Company Common Stock acquired
upon  exercise  of an option in a taxable  transaction,  the  optionholder  will
recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference  between his
basis (as discussed above) in the shares sold and the total amount realized upon
disposition.  Any such  capital  gain or loss  will be  long-term  depending  on
whether the shares of Company Common Stock were held for more than one year from
the date such shares were transferred to the optionholder.

Consequences to the Company

         There are no federal income tax  consequences  to the Company by reason
of the grant of options.

         At the  time  the  optionholder  recognizes  ordinary  income  from the
exercise  of an option,  the Company  will be  entitled to a federal  income tax
deduction  in the amount of the  ordinary  income so  recognized  (as  described
above).

         The Company will be required to report to the Internal  Revenue Service
any ordinary income  recognized by any optionholder by reason of the exercise of
an option.

                                       37
<PAGE>

Other Tax Consequences

         The foregoing  discussion is not a complete  description of the federal
income tax aspects of options  under the Plan. In addition,  administrative  and
judicial  interpretations  of the application of the federal income tax laws are
subject to change. Furthermore,  the foregoing discussion does not address state
or local tax consequences.

Old Plan

         The Company has previously  made grants to outside  directors under the
Directors'   Long-Term   Incentive  Plan,   which  provides  for  maximum  award
opportunities  of 600 shares of Company  Common  Stock  every  other  year.  One
performance  period (1994 - 1997) is still running under this plan,  although no
new performance period will commence in 1996. On and after the effective date of
the new Plan, the shares  relating to the existing  performance  period shall be
deemed to be covered by the new Plan and shall be counted  against the number of
shares  available under the new Plan, and their grant and the performance  goals
shall be deemed to have been approved by Company  shareholders by their approval
of the new Plan.

         The old plan  awards a maximum  of 600  shares of Common  Stock to each
outside director if, over a four-year period commencing with each  even-numbered
year, total  shareholder  return (TSR) equals or exceeds (i) median TSR compared
to a pre-selected  group of comparable  utilities (listed below) and/or (ii) the
40th  percentile  TSR  compared to  companies  in the  Standard & Poor's 500. No
awards are  granted to  directors  if  Company  results  are below both of these
threshold  performance levels. The comparison to comparable utilities and to the
S&P 500 companies is weighted 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively.

         The first comparator group is comprised of:

                  MidAmerican Energy Company
                  IES Industries, Inc.
                  Interstate Power Company
                  Madison Gas & Electric Company
                  Northern States Power Company
                  Otter Tail Power Company
                  Wisconsin Energy Corporation
                  WPL Holdings, Inc.

Effective Date.

appointed  by the  Board  consisting  of not less than  three  (3)  non-employee
Directors. The members of the Committee shall be appointed from time to time by,
and shall serve at the discretion of, the Board of Directors.

        The Committee,  to the extent  necessary,  shall be comprised  solely of
Directors who are eligible to  administer  the Plan pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act and Treas. Reg.  1.162-27(e)(3)  with respect to Grants made to
Named  Executive  Officers.  However,  if for any reason the Committee  does not
qualify to administer the Plan, as contemplated by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act or Treas.  Reg.  1.162-27(e)(3),  the Board of  Directors  may appoint a new
Committee so as to comply with Rule 16b-3 and Treas. Reg. 1.162-27(e)(3).

        2     Authority of the  Committee.  The Committee  shall have full
power except as limited by law, the Articles of Incorporation  and the Bylaws of
the Company,  subject to such other restricting limitations or directions as may
be imposed by the Board and subject to the provisions  herein,  to determine the
size and types of Grants;  to determine the terms and  conditions of such Grants
in a manner consistent with the Plan; to construe and interpret the Plan and any
agreement or  instrument  entered into under the Plan;  to  establish,  amend or
waive rules and regulations for the Plan's  administration;  and (subject to the
provisions  of  Article  15  herein)  to amend the terms and  conditions  of any
outstanding Grant.  Further,  the Committee shall make all other  determinations
which may be necessary  or  advisable  for the  administration  of the Plan.  As
permitted by law, the  Committee  may delegate  its  authorities  as  identified
hereunder.

        3     Decisions Binding.  All determinations  and  decisions made by the
Committee  pursuant  to the  provisions  of the Plan and all  related  orders or
resolutions of the Board shall be final,  conclusive and binding on all persons,
including  the Company,  its  shareholders,  Employees,  Participants  and their

reorganization, consolidation,  recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, split-up, share combination or other change in the corporate structure
of the Company affecting the Shares, such adjustment shall be made in the number

class of and/or  price of Shares  subject to  outstanding  Grants made under the
Plan, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee,  in
its sole  discretion,  to prevent  dilution or enlargement of rights;  provided,
however,  that the number of Shares subject to any Grant shall always be a whole
number.

determined by the Committee,  including  Employees who are members of the Board,

        2     Actual Participation. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the
Committee may, from time to time,  select from all eligible  Employees  those to
whom  Grants  shall be made and shall  determine  the  nature and amount of each
Grant.


6.      Stock Options

        1     Grant of Options. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
Options  may be granted  to an  Eligible  Employee  at any time and from time to
time, as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have complete
discretion in  determining  the number of Shares  subject to Options  granted to
each  Participant  (subject  to  Article  4  herein)  and  consistent  with  the
provisions of the Plan, in determining  the terms and  conditions  pertaining to
such Options; provided, however, the maximum number of shares subject to Options
which may be granted to any single  Participant  during any one calendar year is
twenty thousand  (20,000).  The Committee may grant ISOs, NQSOs or a combination
thereof.

        2     Option Grant Agreement. Each Option grant shall be evidenced by
an Option Grant  Agreement that shall specify the Option Price,  the duration of
the  Option,  the number of Shares to which the Option  pertains,  the  Exercise
Period and such other  provisions as the Committee shall  determine.  The Option
Grant  Agreement also shall specify  whether the Option is intended to be an ISO
or a NQSO.

        3     Option Price. The Option Price for each Option granted under the
Plan shall be the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.

        4     Duration of Options. Each  Option shall expire at such time as the
Committee  shall  determine  at the time of grant;  provided,  however,  that no
Option shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th)  anniversary of its date
of grant.

        5     Dividend Equivalents. Simultaneously with the grant of an Option,
the Participant  receiving the Option may be granted  Dividend  Equivalents with
respect  to the  Shares  subject  to such  Option.  Dividend  Equivalents  shall
constitute rights to amounts equal to the dividends  declared on an equal number
of outstanding  Shares on all payment dates occurring  during the period between
the grant date of an Option and the date the Option is exercised.  The Committee
shall determine at the time Dividend Equivalents are granted the conditions,  if
any, to which the payment of such Dividend Equivalents is subject.

        6     Exercise of and Payment for Options. Options granted under the
Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such  restrictions and
conditions as the Committee  shall in each instance  approve,  which need not be
the same for each  Grant or for each  Participant.  However,  in no event may an
Option  granted  under  the Plan  become  exercisable  prior  to six (6)  months
following the date of its grant.

                                   6
<PAGE>

         A  Participant  may  exercise an Option at any time during the Exercise
Period.  Options  shall be  exercised  by the  delivery  of a written  notice of
exercise to the  Company,  setting  forth the number of Shares  with  respect to
which the Option is to be exercised,  accompanied by provisions for full payment
for the Shares.

         The Option  Price upon  exercise of any Option  shall be payable to the
Company  in  full  either  (a) in  cash  or  its  equivalent,  (b) by  tendering
previously  acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of
exercise  equal to the total  Option Price  (provided  that the Shares which are
tendered  must  have been held by the  Participant  for at least six (6)  months
prior to their tender to satisfy the Option Price),  (c) by share withholding or
(d) by a combination of (a), (b) and/or (c).

         The  Committee  also may allow  cashless  exercise as  permitted  under
Federal  Reserve  Board's  Regulation  T, subject to applicable  securities  law
restrictions,  or by any  other  means  which  the  Committee  determines  to be
consistent with the Plan's purpose and applicable law.

         As soon as  practicable  after  receipt  of a written  notification  of
exercise of an Option and  provisions  for full  payment  therefor,  the Company
shall deliver to the Participant,  in the Participant's name, Share certificates
in an  appropriate  amount based upon the number of Shares  purchased  under the
Option(s).

        7     Restrictions on Share Transferability.  The Committee may impose
such  restrictions on any Shares acquired  pursuant to the exercise of an Option
under  the  Plan  as it  may  deem  advisable,  including,  without  limitation,
restrictions  to  comply  with  applicable  Federal  securities  laws,  with the
requirements  of any stock  exchange  or market  upon which such Shares are then
listed and/or traded and with any blue sky or state  securities  laws applicable
to such Shares.

        8     Termination of Employment. Each Option Grant Agreement shall set
forth the extent to which the  Participant  shall have the right to exercise the
Option following  termination of the  Participant's  employment with the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion
of the Committee,  shall be included in the Option Grant Agreement  entered into
with Participants, need not be uniform among all Options granted pursuant to the
Plan or among Participants and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for
termination of employment.

        9     Nontransferability of Options. No Option granted under the Plan
may  be  sold,  transferred,   pledged,  assigned,  or  otherwise  alienated  or
hypothecated,  other  than by will or by the laws of descent  and  distribution.
Further,  all  Options  granted  to  a  Participant  under  the  Plan  shall  be
exercisable  during his or her lifetime only by such  Participant  or his or her
legal representative.


7.      Stock Appreciation Rights

        1     Grant of SARs. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
an SAR may be granted to an Eligible Employee at any time and from time to time,
as shall be determined by the  Committee.  The Committee may grant  Freestanding
SARs, Tandem SARs or any combination of these forms of SAR.

                                   7
<PAGE>

        The Committee  shall have complete  discretion in determining the number
of SARs  granted  to  each  Participant  (subject  to  Article  4  herein)  and,
consistent  with the  provisions  of the  Plan,  in  determining  the  terms and
conditions  pertaining to such SARs;  provided,  however,  the maximum number of
SARs which may be granted to any single Participant during any one calendar year
is twenty thousand (20,000).

         The Base Value of a Freestanding  SAR shall equal the Fair Market Value
of a Share on the date of grant of the SAR.  The Base Value of Tandem SARs shall
equal the Option Price of the related Option.  In no event shall any SAR granted
hereunder become exercisable within the first six (6) months of its grant.

        2     SAR Grant Agreement. Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an SAR
Grant Agreement  that shall specify the number of SARs  granted, the Base Value,
the term of the SAR (not to exceed ten (10) years), the Exercise Period and such
other provisions as the Committee shall determine.

        3     Exercise of Tandem SARs.  Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or
part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right
to exercise the equivalent  portion of the related  Option.  A Tandem SAR may be
exercised  only with respect to the Shares for which its related  Option is then
exercisable.

        Notwithstanding  any other  provision of the Plan to the contrary,  with
respect to a Tandem SAR granted in  connection  with an ISO:  (i) the Tandem SAR
will expire no later than the expiration of the  underlying  ISO; (ii) the value
of the payout with respect to the Tandem SAR may be for no more than one hundred
percent (100%) of the difference  between the Option Price of the underlying ISO
and the Fair Market  Value of the Shares  subject to the  underlying  ISO at the
time the Tandem SAR is exercised; and (iii) the Tandem SAR may be exercised only
when the Fair Market  Value of the Shares  subject to the ISO exceeds the Option
Price of the ISO.

        4     Exercise of Freestanding SARs. Freestanding SARs may be exercised
upon  whatever  terms and  conditions  the  Committee,  in its sole  discretion,
imposes upon them.

        5     Exercise and Payment of SARs. A Participant may exercise an SAR
at anytime during the Exercise  Period.  SARs shall be exercised by the delivery
of a written notice of exercise to the Company, setting forth the number of SARs
being  exercised.  Upon exercise of an SAR, a  Participant  shall be entitled to
receive payment from the Company in an amount equal to the product of:

        (a)    the  excess of (i) the Fair Market  Value of a Share on the date
of exercise over (ii) the Base Value of the SAR, multiplied by

        (b)    the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

        At the sole  discretion of the Committee,  the payment upon SAR exercise
may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.

                                  8
<PAGE>

        6     Termination of Employment.  Each SAR Grant Agreement shall set
forth the extent to which the  Participant  shall have the right to exercise the
SAR following  termination of the Participant's  employment with the Company and
its Subsidiaries.  Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of
the Committee,  shall be included in the SAR Grant  Agreement  entered into with
Participants, need not be uniform among all SARs granted pursuant to the Plan or
among  Participants  and may  reflect  distinctions  based  on the  reasons  for
termination of employment.

        7     Nontransferability of SARs. No SAR granted under the Plan may be
sold, transferred,  pledged,  assigned, or otherwise  alienated or hypothecated,
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, all SARs
granted to a Participant  under the Plan shall be exercisable  during his or her
lifetime only by such Participant or his or her legal representative.


8.      Restricted Stock

        1     Grant of Restricted Stock.  Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Plan,  Restricted Stock may be granted to Eligible  Employees at any time
and from time to time, as shall be determined  by the  Committee.  The Committee
shall have complete discretion in determining the number of shares of Restricted
Stock granted to each Participant  (subject to Article 4 herein) and, consistent
with the  provisions  of the Plan,  in  determining  the  terms  and  conditions
pertaining to such Restricted Stock.

        2     Restricted Stock Grant Agreement. Each Restricted Stock grant
shall  be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Grant Agreement that shall specify the
Period or Periods of Restriction,  the number of Restricted Stock Shares granted
and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine.

        3     Transferability.  Except as provided in this Article 8, Restricted
Stock  granted  herein  may not be  sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned,  or
otherwise  alienated or hypothecated  until the end of the applicable  Period of
Restriction  established by the Committee and specified in the Restricted  Stock
Grant Agreement. However, in no event may any Restricted Stock granted under the
Plan become vested in a Participant  prior to six (6) months  following the date
of its grant.  All rights  with  respect to the  Restricted  Stock  granted to a
Participant under the Plan shall be available during his or her lifetime only to
such Participant.
            
        4     Certificate  Legend.  Each certificate  representing  Restricted
Stock granted pursuant to the Plan may bear a legend substantially as follows:

        "The sale or other  transfer of the shares of stock  represented by
        this certificate, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of
        law, is subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in
        the Minnesota  Power  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation
        Plan,  and in a Restricted  Stock Grant  Agreement.  A copy of such
        Plan and such  Agreement  may be obtained  from  Minnesota  Power &
        Light Company."

     The Company  shall have the right to retain the  certificates  representing
Restricted Stock in the Company's possession until such time as all restrictions
applicable to such Shares have been satisfied.

        5     Removal of Restrictions.  Except as otherwise provided in this
Article 8, Restricted  Stock shall become freely  transferable by the
Participant  after the last day of the Period of Restriction applicable thereto.
Once Restricted  Stock is released from the restrictions,  the  Participant
shall be entitled to have the legend  referred to in Section 8.4 removed  from
his or her stock certificate.

                                   9
<PAGE>

        6     Voting Rights. During the Period of Restriction,  Participants
holding  Restricted  Stock may exercise  full voting  rights with respect to
those Shares.

        7     Dividends and Other Distributions.  During the Period of 
Restriction,  Participants  holding  Restricted Stock shall be credited with all
regular cash  dividends  paid with respect to all Shares while they are so held.
All cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to Restricted Stock
shall  be  credited  to  Participants   subject  to  the  same  restrictions  on
transferability and forfeitability as the Restricted Stock with respect to which
they were paid. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares,  such
Shares  shall  be  subject  to the  same  restrictions  on  transferability  and
forfeitability  as the  Restricted  Stock with  respect to which they were paid.
Subject  to the  restrictions  on vesting  and the  forfeiture  provisions,  all
dividends  credited to a Participant  shall be paid to the Participant  promptly
following  the full vesting of the  Restricted  Stock with respect to which such
dividends were paid. The provisions of this Section 8.7 are subject to the right
of the Committee to determine otherwise at the time of grant.

        8     Termination  of  Employment.  Each  Restricted  Stock Grant
Agreement  shall set forth the  extent to which the  Participant  shall have the
right  to  receive  unvested  Restricted  Shares  following  termination  of the
Participant's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.  Such provisions
shall be determined in the sole  discretion of the Committee,  shall be included
in the Restricted Stock Grant Agreement entered into with Participants, need not
be uniform among all grants of Restricted  Stock or among  Participants  and may
reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment.
             
9.      Performance Units and Performance Shares

        1     Grant of  Performance  Units and Performance  Shares.  Subject to 
the  terms of the Plan,  Performance  Units  and/or  Performance  Shares  may be
granted to an Eligible  Employee at any time and from time to time,  as shall be
determined by the  Committee.  The Committee  shall have complete  discretion in
determining the number of Performance Units and/or Performance Shares granted to
each  Participant  (subject  to  Article  4  herein)  and,  consistent  with the
provisions of the Plan, in determining  the terms and  conditions  pertaining to
such Grants;  provided,  however,  the maximum payout to any single  Participant
with respect to Performance Units granted in any one calendar year shall be 200%
of base salary  determined  at the earlier of the  beginning of the  Performance
Period  and the time the  performance  goals are set by the  Committee  and with
respect to Performance Shares shall be twenty thousand (20,000) shares.

        2     Performance  Unit/Performance  Share Grant  Agreement.  Each grant
of  Performance  Units  and/or  Performance  Shares  shall  be  evidenced  by  a
Performance Unit and/or Performance Share Grant Agreement that shall specify the
number of Performance Units and/or Performance Shares granted, the initial value
(if applicable),  the Performance  Period,  the performance goals and such other
provisions as the Committee shall determine,  including, but not limited to, any
right to Dividend Equivalents during or after the Performance Period.

                                   10
<PAGE>

        3     Value of Performance  Units/Shares.  Each  Performance  Unit shall
have an initial value that is established by the Committee at the time of grant.
The  value of a  Performance  Share  shall  equal the  value of one  Share.  The
Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which,  depending on the
extent  to  which  they are met,  will  determine  the  number  and/or  value of
Performance  Units/Shares  that will be paid out to the  Participants.  The time
period  during  which  the  performance  goals  must be met  shall  be  called a
"Performance  Period."  Performance Periods shall, in all cases, be at least six
(6) months in length.

        Unless and until the Committee  proposes for shareholder  vote a change
in the general  performance goals set forth below, the attainment of which shall
serve as a basis for the determination of the number and/or value of Performance
Units and/or Performance Shares granted under the Plan, the performance goals to
be used for purposes of grants to Named  Executive  Officers shall be based upon
any one or more of the following:

        (a)      Total  shareholder return (measured as the sum of Share
             appreciation  and  dividends declared).

        (b)      Return on invested capital, assets or net assets.

        (c)      Share earnings/earnings growth.

        (d)      Cash flow/cash flow growth.

        (e)      Cost of services to consumers.

        (f)      Growth in revenues, sales, operating income, net income, stock
             price and/or earnings per share.

        (g)      Return on shareholders equity.

        (h)      Economic value created.

        (i)      Customer satisfaction and/or customer service quality.

        (j)      Operating effectiveness.

      In the event that applicable tax and/or securities laws change to permit
Committee discretion to alter the governing  performance goals without obtaining
shareholder  approval of such changes and without losing any income tax benefits
to the Company,  the Committee  shall have sole  discretion to make such changes
without obtaining shareholder approval.

        4     Earning of Performance Units/Shares. After the applicable
Performance  Period has ended, the holder of Performance  Units/Shares  shall be
entitled to receive payout with respect to the Performance  Units/Shares  earned
by the Participant over the Performance  Period,  to be determined as a function
of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

                                   11
<PAGE>

        5     Form and  Timing of  Payment  of  Performance  Units/Shares.
Payment of earned Performance  Units/Shares shall be made following the close of
the applicable Performance Period or at such later time as the Committee, in its
sole discretion,  may determine. The Committee, in its sole discretion,  may pay
earned  Performance  Units/Shares  in cash  or in  Shares  (or in a  combination
thereof),  which have an  aggregate  Fair Market Value equal to the value of the
earned  Performance Units/Shares  at the  close of the  applicable  Performance
Period.  Such Shares may  be  granted  subject  to  any  restrictions  deemed 
appropriate by the Committee.

        6     Dividend Equivalents. Simultaneously with the grant of Performance
Shares, the Participant may be granted Dividend Equivalents with respect to such
Performance  Shares.  Dividend  Equivalents  shall constitute  rights to amounts
equal to the dividends  declared on an equal number of outstanding Shares on all
payment dates  occurring  during the period  between the grant date and the date
the Performance  Shares are earned or paid out. The Committee shall determine at
the time Dividend  Equivalents are granted the conditions,  if any, to which the
payment of such Dividend Equivalents is subject.

        7     Termination of Employment.  Each Grant  Agreement  shall set forth
the  extent  to which  the  Participant  shall  have  the  right  to  receive  a
Performance   Unit/Share  payout  following  termination  of  the  Participant's
employment  with the  Company and its  Subsidiaries.  Such  provisions  shall be
determined  in the sole  discretion of the  Committee,  shall be included in the
Grant Agreement  entered into with the  Participants,  need not be uniform among
all grants of Performance  Units/Shares  or among  Participants  and may reflect
distinctions based upon reasons for termination of employment.

        8     Nontransferability.  Performance  Units/Shares  may  not be sold, 
transferred,  pledged,  assigned or otherwise  alienated or hypothecated,  other
than  by  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution.   Further,  a
Participant's   rights   under  the  Plan  shall  be   exercisable   during  the
Participant's  lifetime  only  by the  Participant  or the  Participant's  legal
representative.

10.     Other Grants

       The  Committee  shall  have the  right to make  other  Grants  which may
include,  without  limitation,  the grant of Shares based on certain conditions,
the payment of cash based on performance  criteria established by the Committee,
and the payment of Shares in lieu of cash under other Company incentive or bonus
programs.  Payment  under or settlement of any such Grants shall be made in such
manner and at such times as the Committee may determine.


11.     Beneficiary Designation

       Each  Participant  under  the Plan  may,  from  time to  time,  name any
beneficiary or beneficiaries  (who may be named contingently or successively) to
whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before
he or she  receives  any or all of such  benefit.  Each such  designation  shall
revoke  all  prior  designations  by the  same  Participant,  shall be in a form
prescribed  by the  Committee,  and will be  effective  only  when  filed by the
Participant in writing with the Committee during the Participant's  lifetime. In
the  absence  of  any  such  designation,   benefits  remaining  unpaid  at  the
Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

        The spouse of a married  Participant  domiciled in a community  property
jurisdiction shall join in any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries other
than the spouse.

                                   12
<PAGE>
12. Deferrals

        The  Committee  may permit a  Participant  to defer  such  Participant's
receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be
due to such  Participant  by  virtue  of (1) the  exercise  of an SAR or (2) the
satisfaction  of any  requirements  or goals with respect to any Grants.  If any
such  deferral  election  is  permitted,   the  Committee  shall,  in  its  sole
discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals.


13. Rights of Employees

        1     Employment.  Nothing in the Plan shall  interfere with or limit in
any way the right of the Company to terminate  any  Participant's  employment at
any time,  for any reason or no reason in the  Company's  sole  discretion,  nor
confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company.

        2     Participation. No  Employee shall have the right to be selected to
receive a Grant under the Plan,  or, having been so selected,  to be selected to
receive a future Grant.


14.     Change in Control

        Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,  as defined  herein,  unless
otherwise  specifically  prohibited  by the terms of Article 18 herein or unless
the Committee provides otherwise prior to the Change in Control:

        (a)      Any  and  all Options and SARs granted hereunder shall  become
             immediately exercisable;

        (b)      Any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted 
             Stock shall be deemed to have expired;

        (c)      With  respect  to all outstanding Grants of Performance Units,
             Performance   Shares  and other performance-based   Grants,  there
             shall be paid out immediately to Participants the superior number
             of Performance Units or Shares granted for the entire Performance
             Period as increased by Dividend Equivalents for the entire 
             Performance Period. Payment shall be made in cash or in stock, as
             determined by the Committee. However, there shall not be an 
             accelerated payout under this Section 14(c) with respect to Grants
             of Performance Units, Performance Shares or other performance-based
             Grants which were made less than six (6) months prior to the 
             effective date of the Change in Control; and

                                   13
<PAGE>
    
        (d)      All  earned  Performance  Units, Performance Shares  and  other
             performance-based  Grants (as increased by any Dividend Equivalents
             to the  date of  payment)  not  yet  paid  out  shall  be paid  out
             immediately, in cash or in stock, as determined by the Committee.

15.     Amendment, Modification  and Termination

        1     Amendment,  Modification and  Termination.  The Board may, at any 
time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole
or in part;  provided,  however,  that no amendment  which requires  shareholder
approval  in order for the Plan to  continue to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act,  including any successor to such Rule,  shall be effective  unless
such amendment  shall be approved by the requisite vote of the  shareholders  of
the Company entitled to vote thereon.

        2     Grants  Previously Made. No termination, amendment or modification
of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Grant previously made
under the Plan,  without the written  consent of the  Participant  holding  such
Grant  unless  such  termination,  modification  or  amendment  is  required  by
applicable law.

16.     Withholding

        1     Tax  Withholding.  The Company shall have the power and the right
to deduct or withhold,  or require a  Participant  to remit to the  Company,  an
amount  sufficient  to satisfy  Federal,  state and local taxes  (including  the
Participant's FICA obligation)  required by law to be withheld with respect to a
Grant made under the Plan.

        2     Share  Withholding.  With  respect to  withholding  required  upon
the exercise of Options or SARs,  upon the lapse of  restrictions  on Restricted
Stock,  or upon any other  taxable event arising out of or as a result of Grants
made  hereunder,  Participants  may  elect,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
Committee,  to satisfy  the  withholding  requirement,  in whole or in part,  by
having the Company  withhold  Shares  having a Fair Market Value on the date the
tax is to be determined equal to the minimum  statutory total tax which could be
imposed on the transaction. All elections shall be irrevocable,  made in writing
and signed by the Participant.

17.     Successors

        All  obligations  of the Company under the Plan,  with respect to Grants
made  hereunder,  shall be binding on any successor to the Company,  whether the
existence  of such  successor  is the result of a direct or  indirect  purchase,
merger,  consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company.

                                   14
<PAGE>
18.     Legal Construction

        1     Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the
context,  any masculine  term used herein also shall  include the feminine,  the
plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.

        2     Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect
the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as
if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

        3     Requirements of Law. The making of Grants and the issuance of 
Shares  under  the Plan  shall be  subject  to all  applicable  laws,  rules and
regulations,  and to such  approvals  by any  governmental  agencies or national
securities exchanges as may be required.

        Notwithstanding  any other  provision set forth in the Plan, if required
by the then-current Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any "derivative security" or
"equity security" offered pursuant to the Plan to any Insider may not be sold or
transferred  within the minimum time limits  specified or required in such rule.
The terms "equity  security" and  "derivative  security" shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the then-current Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act.

        4     Securities Law Compliance.  With respect to Insiders, transactions
under the Plan are  intended to comply  with all  applicable  conditions  of the
Federal  securities  laws.  To the extent any provision of the Plan or action by
the  Committee  fails to so  comply,  it shall be deemed  null and void,  to the
extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee.

        5     Governing  Law. To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the 
Plan, and all agreements  hereunder,  shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed by, the laws of the State of Minnesota.

                     DIRECTOR LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN


                   
1.      Establishment, Purpose and Duration
       
        1     Establishment of the Plan.  Minnesota Power & Light Company,
a  Minnesota  corporation  (hereinafter  referred to as the  "Company"),  hereby
establishes  an  outside  director  plan to be  known  as the  "Minnesota  Power
Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive  Plan"  (hereinafter  referred  to as  the
"Plan"),  as set forth in this  document.  The Plan  provides for the  automatic
grant of Stock Options and Performance Shares to non-employee directors.

        The Plan shall become  effective as of January 1, 1996 (the  "Effective
Date"),  subject to shareholder approval, and shall remain in effect as provided
in Section 1.3 herein.
       
        2     Purpose of the Plan.  The  purpose of the Plan is to promote
the  success  and  enhance  the value of the  Company  by linking  the  personal
interests  of directors  to those of Company  shareholders.  The Plan is further

Effective Date, as described in Section 1.1 herein,  and shall remain in effect,
subject to the right of the Board of Directors to terminate the Plan at any time

grants to outside directors under the Directors' Long-Term Incentive Plan, which

by this Plan and shall be counted  against the number of shares  available under
this Plan,  and their  grant and the  performance  goals shall be deemed to have

forth in the next sentence.  One-half of the remaining earned Performance Shares

understanding,  express or implied, that the Company will retain a Director as a
director  or in any other  capacity  for any  period of time or at a  particular
retainer or other rate of  compensation,  as conferring upon any Participant any
legal or other right to continue as a director or in any other  capacity,  or as
limiting,  interfering  with or otherwise  affecting the right of the Company to
terminate a  Participant  in his capacity as a director or otherwise at any time

                giving effect to accumulation  of Dividend  Equivalents and (ii)
                shall pay to the  Participants  immediately  the greater of such
                amounts,  in Shares,  prorated based upon the number of complete
                and partial calendar months within the Performance  Period which
                have elapsed as of the  effective  date of the Change in Control
                in  relation  to the  number  of  calendar  months  in the  full
                Performance Period.  However,  there shall not be an accelerated
                payout  under  this  Section  11(b)  with  respect  to Grants of
                Performance  Shares  which  were made  less than six (6)  months
                prior to the effective date of the Change in Control; and

        (c)    All earned Performance  Shares (as increased by Dividend  
               Equivalents) not yet paid out shall be paid out immediately.

        
12.     Amendment, Modification  and Termination
                    
        1     Amendment,  Modification and Termination.  The Board may, at
any time and from time to time, alter,  amend,  suspend or terminate the Plan in
whole  or  in  part;  provided,   however,  that  no  amendment  which  requires
shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act, including any successor to such Rule, shall be effective
unless  such  amendment   shall  be  approved  by  the  requisite  vote  of  the
shareholders  of the  Company  entitled  to vote  thereon.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  any provision of the Plan that either states the amount and price of
securities  to be  issued  under  the  Plan and  specifies  the  timing  of such
issuances,  or sets forth a formula that determines the amount, price and timing
of such issuances,  shall not be amended more than once every six months,  other
than to  comport  with  changes  in the Code,  the  Employee  Retirement  Income
Security Act of 1974, or the rules thereunder.
                      
        2     Grants Previously Made.  No termination, amendment or modification
of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Grant previously made
under the Plan,  without the written  consent of the  Participant  holding  such
Grant  unless  such  termination,  modification  or  amendment  is  required  by
applicable law.
                  
13.     Restrictions on Share Transferability

        The  Committee  may impose  such  restrictions  on any Shares  acquired
pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the payment of Performance Shares under
the Plan as it may deem advisable,  including, without limitation,  restrictions
to comply with applicable  Federal securities laws, with the requirements of any
stock  exchange or market upon which such Shares are then listed  and/or  traded
and with any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares.

                
14.     Nontransferability

        No Options or  Performance  Shares  granted under the Plan may be sold,
transferred,  pledged,  assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated,  other
than  by  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution.   Further,  a
Participant's  rights  under the Plan  shall be  exercisable  during  his or her
lifetime only by such Participant or his or her legal representative.

15.     Successors

        All obligations  of the Company under the Plan,  with respect to Grants
made  hereunder,  shall be binding on any successor to the Company,  whether the
existence  of such  successor  is the result of a direct or  indirect  purchase,
merger,  consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company.
                
16.     Legal Construction
        
        1     Gender and Number.  Except where otherwise  indicated by the
context,  any masculine  term used herein also shall  include the feminine,  the
plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.

        2     Severability.  In the event any provision of the Plan shall
be held illegal or invalid for any reason,  the  illegality or invalidity  shall
not affect the remaining  parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
        
        3     Requirements of Law.  Neither the Plan nor the Company shall
be  obligated  to issue any shares of common  stock  pursuant to the Plan at any
time  unless and until all  applicable  requirements  imposed by any federal and
state  securities  and other  laws,  rules and  regulations,  by any  regulatory
agencies  or by any stock  exchanges  upon which the common  stock may be listed
have been fully met.  As a  condition  precedent  to any  issuance  of shares of
common stock and delivery of certificates evidencing such shares pursuant to the
Plan,  the Board or the  Committee  may  require a  Participant to take any such
action or make any such covenants,  agreements and  representations as the Board
or the  Committee,  as the case may be, in its  discretion  deems  necessary  or
advisable to ensure compliance with such  requirements.  The Company shall in no
event be obligated to register the shares of common stock  deliverable under the
Plan  pursuant  to the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  or to qualify or
register such shares under any securities  laws of any state upon their issuance
under the Plan or at any time  thereafter,  or to take any other action in order
to  cause  the  issuance  and  delivery  of such  shares  under  the Plan or any
subsequent offer, sale, or other transfer of such shares to comply with any such
law, regulation or requirement.  Participants are responsible for complying with
all  applicable  federal  and  state  securities  and  other  laws,  rules,  and
regulations in connection with any offer,  sale, or other transfer of the shares
of common stock issued under the Plan or any interest therein including, without
limitation,  compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933 as amended  (unless an  exception  therefrom is  available)  or with the
provisions of Rule 144 promulgated thereunder,  if applicable,  or any successor
provisions.  Certificates  for  shares of common  stock may be  legended  as the
Committee shall deem appropriate.
                        
        Notwithstanding  any other provision set forth in the Plan, if required
by the then-current Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any "derivative security" or
"equity security" offered pursuant to the Plan to any Insider may not be sold or
transferred  within the minimum time limits  specified or required in such rule.
The terms "equity  security" and  "derivative  security" shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the then-current Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act.

        4     Securities  Law  Compliance.   With  respect  to  Insiders,
transactions  under  the  Plan  are  intended  to  comply  with  all  applicable
conditions  of the Federal  securities  laws. To the extent any provision of the
Plan or action by the Committee fails to so comply,  it shall be deemed null and
void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee.
        
        Governing  Law. To the extent not  preempted  by Federal law,
the Plan, and all agreements  hereunder,  shall be construed in accordance with,
and governed by, the laws of the State of Minnesota.

                       Directors' Long-Term Incentive Plan

                  
                  The plan  awards a maximum  of 600  shares of common  stock to
each  outside  director  if,  over  a  four-year  period  commencing  with  each
even-numbered year, total shareholders return (TSR) equals or exceeds (i) median
TSR compared to a  pre-selected  group of comparable  utilities  (listed  below)
and/or (ii) the 40.0  percentile  TSR  compared to  companies  in the Standard &
Poor's 500. No awards are granted to directors if Company results are below both
of these threshold  performance  levels. The comparison to comparable  utilities
and to the S&P 500 companies is weighted 60% and 40%, respectively.

                  The first comparator group is comprised of:

Midamerican Energy Company
IES Industries, Inc.
Interstate Power Company
Madison Gas & Electric Company
Northern States Power Company
Otter Tail Power Company
Wisconsin Energy Corporation
WPL Holdings, Inc.
Northwestern Public Service Company
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation

                  The second comparator group is the companies comprising the
S&P 500.

                  After  calculation  of the  Company's  TSR ranking  within the
first and second comparator  groups, the schedule below indicates the percent of
the Director's Performance Award Opportunity actually earned.

         TSR is defined as:

                  TSR = Stock price appreciation + reinvested dividends
                        -----------------------------------------------
                                        Initial stock price

         -        Stock prices for the  beginning  and end of the period are the
                  closing prices on the composite  reporting system on the first
                  and last business days of the period.

         -        Dividends are assumed to be reinvested on the ex-dividend 
                  date at the closing stock prices on that date.

         -        Calculation of TSR for the S&P 500 group is based on the
                  companies included in the S&P 500 Index as of the end of the
                  period.
