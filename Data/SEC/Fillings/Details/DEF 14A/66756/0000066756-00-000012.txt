[LOGO OF MINNESOTA POWER]


                                                      March 17, 2000


Dear Shareholder:

         You are  cordially  invited to attend  Minnesota  Power's  2000  Annual
Meeting of Shareholders on Tuesday,  May 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m. in the auditorium
at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center (DECC). The DECC is located on the
waterfront  at 350 Harbor  Drive in Duluth.  Free  parking is  available  in the
adjoining lot. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I encourage you to attend.

         Minnesota  Power's  strong  1999  operating  results  were  spurred  by
significant  earnings  growth  in our  automotive  and  water  businesses.  This
performance reflects the successful  implementation of our strategy,  "The Drive
Toward 2000," crafted in 1995. At our Annual Shareholders  Meeting this year, we
will share the exciting  vision of our new five-year  plan,  "Horizon 2005." Our
goals: market leadership in each of our four businesses,  accelerated  financial
performance,  enhanced shareholder return, and completion of our transition to a
multi-services  company.  Now,  more  than  ever,  Minnesota  Power is more than
Minnesota ... and more than power.

         At the Shareholders Meeting, twelve nominees will stand for election to
the Board.  This year I am pleased to announce  that Ms.  Glenda Hood,  Mayor of
Orlando,  Florida,  will stand for  election  to the Board.  Over seven years of
experience  leading  Orlando  under a  strong  mayor  system  provide  her  with
excellent  credentials  for service on the Board as your  representative.  Also,
shareholders will vote on a resolution to appoint  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
the Company's independent accountants.

         After our Annual  Meeting,  we invite you to visit with our  directors,
officers and employees  over a box lunch in the Lake Superior  Ballroom  located
within the DECC. If you plan to attend,  please return the enclosed  reservation
card.

         It is important that your shares be represented at the Annual  Meeting.
Please sign,  date and promptly  return the enclosed  proxy card in the envelope
provided, or, if applicable,  follow the easy instructions for phone or Internet
voting.

         Thank you for your investment in Minnesota Power.

                                                      Sincerely,


                                                      Edwin L. Russell

                                                      Edwin L. Russell
                                                      Chairman, President and
                                                      Chief Executive Officer

the Board of Directors of Minnesota Power, Inc. (Minnesota Power or Company) for
use at the  Annual  Meeting  of  Shareholders  to be held on May 9, 2000 and any

         The Company expects to solicit proxies primarily by mail.  Proxies also
may be  solicited  in person and by  telephone  at a nominal  cost by regular or
retired  employees of the Company.  The  expenses of such  solicitation  are the
ordinary ones in connection with preparing, assembling and mailing the material,
and also include charges and expenses of brokerage houses and other  custodians,
nominees,  or other fiduciaries for communicating with shareholders.  Additional
solicitation  of  proxies  will be made by  mail,  telephone  and in  person  by
Corporate Investor Communications, Inc., a firm specializing in the solicitation
of proxies, at a cost to the Company of approximately $6,000 plus expenses.  The
total amount of such costs will be borne by the Company.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS IN 1999

         During  1999 the Board of  Directors  held 5  meetings.  The  Executive
Committee,  which held 8 meetings during 1999,  provides  oversight of corporate
financial matters,  performs the functions of a director  nominating  committee,
and is  authorized  to  exercise  the  authority  of the Board in the  intervals
between  meetings.  Shareholders  may  recommend  nominees  for  director to the
Executive Committee by addressing the Secretary of the Company, 30 West Superior
Street, Duluth,  Minnesota 55802. The Audit Committee,  which held 7 meetings in
1999, recommends the selection of independent accountants, reviews and evaluates
the Company's  accounting  practices,  reviews periodic  financial reports to be
provided to the public and reviews and  recommends  approval of the annual audit
report.  The Executive  Compensation  Committee,  which held 4 meetings in 1999,
establishes compensation and benefit arrangements for Company officers and other
key executives, intended to be equitable,  competitive with the marketplace, and
consistent with corporate objectives.  All directors attended 75 percent or more
of the  aggregate  number of meetings of the Board of Directors  and  applicable
committee meetings in 1999.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

         Employee  directors  receive  no  additional   compensation  for  their
services as directors.  In 1999 the Company paid each  non-employee  director an
annual  retainer  fee of $5,000 and 1,000 shares of Common Stock under the terms
of the Company's  Director Stock Plan. In addition,  each non-employee  director
was paid $950 for each Board, Committee,  and subsidiary board meeting attended,
except that $500 was paid for  attendance at a second  meeting held the same day
as  another  meeting.  Each  non-employee  director  who  is the  Chairman  of a
Committee  received an additional $150 for each Committee  meeting  attended.  A
$250 fee was paid for all conference call meetings. Directors may elect to defer
all or a part of the cash portion of their retainer and meeting fees. The shares
of Common  Stock paid to directors  with  respect to 1999 had an average  market
price of $19.64 per share.

         Under the Director Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, effective January 1,
1996,  non-employee  directors  receive  automatic grants of 1,500 stock options
every year and performance  shares valued at $10,000 every other year. The stock
options vest 50 percent after the first year, the remaining 50 percent after the
second  year and  expire on the  tenth  anniversary  of the date of  grant.  The
exercise  price for each grant is the closing sale price of Company Common Stock
on the date of grant.  The  performance  periods for  performance  shares end on
December 31, the year following the date of grant.  Dividend  equivalents in the
form of additional  performance  shares accrue during the performance period and
are paid only to the extent the underlying grant is earned. The performance goal
of each performance  period is based on Total Shareholder Return for the Company
in comparison to Total Shareholder Return for 16 diversified electric utilities.
During the four-year  performance period ending December 31, 1999,  shareholders
of the  Company  realized a Total  Shareholder  Return of 52.2  percent on their
investment in Minnesota Power Common Stock,  ranking the Company number 10 among
the 16  diversified  utilities.  With this ranking under the plan, the directors
each earned 321 shares of Common Stock,  an award equal to 62.5 percent of their
target  performance  share award.  Fifty percent of this performance share award
was paid in stock at the end of the performance period. The remaining 50 percent
will  be  paid  in  stock,  half  on the  first  anniversary  of the  end of the
performance period and half on the second anniversary thereof.

PROPOSALS OF SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE 2001 ANNUAL MEETING

         All proposals from  shareholders  to be considered for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting scheduled for May 8, 2001 must be

Minnesota 55802,  not later than November 16, 2000. In addition,  the persons to

matter as to which the Company  did not have  notice  prior to February 5, 2001,
without discussion of such matter in the proxy statement relating to that Annual
Meeting.

<F1>  New options vest 50 percent on January 4, 2000 and 50 percent on January 4, 2001. Options  granted to the top 7
      executives  of the Company  include a replacement option  feature  (see  note 2  below)  and  are subject  to a
      change-in-control acceleration provision.
<F2>  Replacement  options (also known as ownership  retention  options or reload  options) are intended to encourage
      share ownership. They typically do not provide stock appreciation opportunity greater than the original options.
      In addition, they do not result in an increase in equity position,  which is the total combined number of shares
      and options held. Replacement options are granted when the executive uses his shares of Common Stock to fund the
      exercise price of stock options.  One  replacement  option is granted to replace each share that is delivered by
      the executive as payment for the purchase price of shares being acquired through the exercise of a stock option.
      Replacement options become exercisable twelve months after their grant date and terminate on the expiration date
      of the option that they  replace.  The exercise  price of  replacement  options is equal to the closing price of
      Minnesota Power's Common Stock on the grant date of the replacement  options. All replacement options granted in
      1999 have a replacement option feature.
<F3>  The grant date  dollar  value of the new options is based on a Minnesota Power binomial  ratio (as of January 4,
      1999) of .154. The binomial method is a complicated  mathematical  formula premised on immediate  exercisability
      and  transferability  of the  options,  which are not  features of the  Company's  options  granted to executive
      officers and other employees.  The values shown are theoretical and do not necessarily reflect the actual values
      the  recipients  may  eventually  realize.  Any actual value to the officer or other employee will depend on the
      extent to which the market value of the Company's  Common Stock at a future date exceeds the exercise  price. In
      addition to the option  exercise  price,  and the ten-year term of each option,  the following  assumptions  for
      modeling were used to calculate the values shown for the new options granted in 1999: expected dividend yield of
      4.839 percent (based on the most recent quarterly  dividend),  expected stock price volatility of .168 (based on
      250 trading days previous to January 4, 1999),  and the ten-year  option term and a risk-free  rate of return of
      4.65 percent (based on Treasury  yields).  The grant date dollar value of the replacement  options is based on a
      Minnesota Power binomial ratio determined using  assumptions that are materially  similar to those applicable to
      the new options.

     *Represents  the  highest  annualized  average compensation (salary and bonus) received for 48 consecutive months
     during  the  employee's  last 15 years of service with the Company. For determination of the pension benefit, the
     48-month period for highest  average salary may be different from the 48-month  period of highest aggregate bonus
     compensation.

</TABLE>


         Retirement  benefit  amounts  shown are in the form of a  straight-life
annuity  to the  employee  and  are  based  on  amounts  listed  in the  Summary
Compensation  Table  under the  headings  Salary and Bonus.  Retirement  benefit
amounts  shown are not  subject to any  deduction  for Social  Security or other
offset  amounts.  The  Retirement  Plan  provides  that the  benefit  amount  at
retirement  is subject to  adjustment  in future years to reflect cost of living
increases  to a maximum  adjustment  of 3 percent per year.  As of December  31,
1999,  the executive  officers named in the Summary  Compensation  Table had the
following number of years of credited service under the plan:

         Edwin L. Russell     5 years        Robert D. Edwards     23 years
         James P. Hallett     5 years        John Cirello           5 years
         John E. Fuller       5 years

         With certain exceptions, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(Code)  restricts the aggregate amount of annual pension which may be paid to an
employee under the Retirement  Plan to $130,000 for 1999. This amount is subject
to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living increases. The Company's
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides for supplemental payments by the
Company to eligible  executives  (including the executive  officers named in the
Summary  Compensation  Table) in amounts sufficient to maintain total retirement
benefits  upon  retirement  at a level  which  would have been  provided  by the
Retirement Plan if benefits were not restricted by the Code.

REPORT OF BOARDS'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         Described  below  are  the  compensation   policies  of  the  Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors effective for 1999 with respect
to the  executive  officers of the  Company.  Composed  entirely of  independent
outside  directors,  the Executive  Compensation  Committee is  responsible  for
recommending  to the Board  policies  which  govern the  executive  compensation
program of the  Company and for  administering  those  policies.  Since 1995 the
Board has retained the services of William M. Mercer,  Incorporated  (Mercer), a
benefits and compensation  consulting firm, to assist the Executive Compensation
Committee in connection with the performance of such responsibilities.

         The role of the executive  compensation  program is to help the Company
achieve  its  corporate  goals by  motivating  performance,  rewarding  positive
results and enhancing Total Shareholder  Return.  Recognizing that the potential
impact an individual  employee has on the attainment of corporate goals tends to
increase at higher levels within the Company, the executive compensation program
provides  greater  variability  in  compensating  individuals  based on  results
achieved as their levels within the Company  rise.  In other words,  individuals
with the  greatest  potential  impact on  achieving  the  stated  goals have the
greatest  amount to gain when goals are achieved and the greatest amount at risk
when goals are not achieved.

         The program recognizes that, in order to attract and retain exceptional
executive talent needed to lead and grow the Company's businesses,  compensation
must be  competitive  in the  national  market.  To determine  market  levels of
compensation  for  executive  officers  in  1999,  the  Executive   Compensation
Committee relied upon comparative  information for general industrial  companies
provided by Mercer.  The  Committee  determined  that,  because of the Company's
diversified  operations,  general industry data is the most  appropriate  market
benchmark for the executive officers. All data were analyzed to determine median
compensation levels for comparable positions in comparably sized  companies,  as
measured by revenue.  While the companies  represented in the Mercer survey data
are not the same as those in the peer group used in the performance  graph,  the
Committee believes that these companies are appropriate for market  compensation
comparison,  primarily  because  they are  approximately  the  same  size as the
Company as measured by revenue.

         Code  Section  162(m)  generally  disallows a tax  deduction  to public
companies for  compensation  over $1 million paid for any fiscal year to each of
the corporation's CEO and four other most highly compensated  executive officers
as of the end of any fiscal year. Qualifying performance-based compensation will
not be subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements are met. The stock
options and  performance  shares  granted to the  executive  officers  under the
Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan are  intended  to qualify as
performance-based  compensation  within the meaning of Code  Section  162(m) and
should therefore be fully deductible for federal income tax purposes.

         As  described  below,  executive  officers  of the  Company  receive  a
compensation  package  which  consists  of four  basic  elements:  base  salary,
performance-based compensation, supplemental executive benefits and perquisites.
The CEO's compensation is discussed separately.

BASE SALARY

         Base  salaries  are set at a level  so  that,  if the  target  level of
performance is achieved under the  performance-based  plans as described  below,
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of the
performance-based  compensation  plans,  will be near  the  midpoint  of  market
compensation as described above.

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION

         The performance-based compensation plans of the Company are intended by
the  Executive   Compensation  Committee  to  reward  executives  for  achieving
financial  and  non-financial  goals  which  the  Committee  determines  will be
required to achieve the Company's strategic and budgeted goals.

         Performance  goals under  performance-based  plans are  established  in
advance by the  Executive  Compensation  Committee  and the Board of  Directors.
Target  performance  meets  budgeted  financial  goals  and,  in the case of the
long-term plan, may for some executives  include a Total Shareholder Return goal
of at least median performance as measured

                                       9

<PAGE>

against the peer group companies  described below.  Total Shareholder  Return is
defined as stock price appreciation plus dividends reinvested on the ex-dividend
date  throughout  the relevant  performance  period,  divided by the fair market
value  of a share  at the  beginning  of the  performance  period.  With  target
performance,  plus the value of stock options  granted,  executive  compensation
will be near the midpoint of the relevant market.  If no performance  awards are
earned, and no value is attributed to the stock options granted, compensation of
the  Company's  executive  officers  would be  significantly  below the midpoint
market  compensation  level,  while  performance at increments  above the target
level will result in total compensation above the midpoint of the market.

         The Company's performance-based compensation plans include:

      -  RESULTS SHARING.  The Results Sharing award opportunity  rewards annual
         performance of the executive's  responsibility  area as well as overall
         corporate  performance.  Awards are  available to all  employees in the
         electric,  water and  corporate  groups  on the same  percentage-of-pay
         basis.  Target  financial  performance  will  result  in an  award of 5
         percent of base salary, assuming non-financial goals established by the
         Executive Compensation Committee are also accomplished.

      -  EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN. The Executive Annual Incentive Plan is
         intended to focus executive  attention on meeting and exceeding  annual
         financial  and  non-financial  business unit goals  established  by the
         Executive  Compensation  Committee.  For  1999,  financial  goals  were
         business unit  contributions  to net income,  operating cash returns on
         investment,  operating  free cash flow,  and earnings per share.  These
         financial  performance measures were chosen by the Committee because of
         their positive  correlation over time with the Total Shareholder Return
         achieved by the Company for its shareholders.  Target level performance
         is earned if budgeted financial results are achieved. The results shown
         on the Summary  Compensation Table reflect  substantially  above-budget
         financial operating performance of the Company in 1999.

      -  LONG-TERM   INCENTIVE  PLAN  (LTIP).   Under  the  Executive  Long-Term
         Incentive   Compensation   Plan  implemented  in  1996,  the  executive
         officers,  other than the CEO, of the Company have been  awarded  stock
         options  annually  and  performance  shares  biennially  having  in the
         aggregate  target award values ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent of
         their base  salaries.  The value of the award  opportunity is allocated
         between stock options and  performance  shares.  The stock options will
         have value only if the Common Stock price appreciates.  The performance
         shares  granted to the  corporate  group have value if, in 2 years from
         the grant date,  the Total  Shareholder  Return of the Company,  over a
         4-year  performance  measurement  period  determined  in advance by the
         Board  of  Directors,  ranks  at  least  11th  in a  peer  group  of 16
         diversified  electric  utilities adopted by the Executive  Compensation
         Committee  as  appropriate  comparators.  Twenty-five  percent  of  the
         performance  share award to business  unit  executives  is based on the
         foregoing ranking,  and 75 percent is based on other financial measures
         selected by the Committee  because of their  correlation over time with
         Total Shareholder  Return.  Dividend  equivalents accrue on performance
         shares during the performance  period and are paid in Common Stock only
         to the extent performance goals are achieved. The maximum payout is 200
         percent of the target award. If earned,  the performance shares will be
         paid in Common Stock with 50 percent of the award paid after the end of
         the performance  period, 25 percent on the first anniversary of the end
         of the performance period and 25 percent on the second anniversary. For
         the 4-year performance period ending December 31, 1999, shareholders of
         the  Company  realized a Total  Shareholder  Return of 52.2  percent on
         their  investment in Minnesota Power Common Stock,  ranking the Company
         number 10 among the 16-member peer group.

         The Executive  Compensation  Committee has determined that these awards
are  consistent  with its  philosophy  of linking a  significant  portion of the
executive  officers'  compensation to the performance of the Company as measured
by Total Shareholder Return or by other measures of financial  performance which
correlate over time with Total Shareholder Return.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE BENEFITS

         The Company has  established a Supplemental  Executive  Retirement Plan
(SERP) to  compensate  certain  employees,  including  the  executive  officers,
equitably by replacing benefits not provided by the Company's Flexible

                                       10
<PAGE>

Benefit Plan and the Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan due to  government-imposed
limits and to  provide  retirement  benefits  which are  competitive  with those
offered  by other  businesses  with which the  Company  competes  for  executive
talent.  The SERP also  provides  employees  whose  salaries  exceed  the salary
limitations for tax-qualified plans imposed by the Code with additional benefits
such that they receive in aggregate  the benefits  they would have been entitled
to receive had such limitations not been imposed.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

         The  Executive  Compensation  Committee  has  endeavored to provide Mr.
Russell  with  a  compensation  package  that  is  at  the  50th  percentile  of
compensation paid by general industrial companies with revenue comparable to the
Company.  The  Committee  has designed  Mr.  Russell's  compensation  package to
provide  substantial  incentive  to achieve  and exceed  the  Board's  financial
performance  goals for the Company and Total  Shareholder  Return  goals for the
Company's shareholders.

         In June 1999,  the Board of Directors  increased Mr.  Russell's  annual
base salary 7.9 percent.  Approximately  half of this  increase was to align his
base salary  with the median of  comparably sized  companies  and the other half
related  to his  contributions  to the  performance  of the  Company.  Under the
Company's Results Sharing Plan, Mr. Russell was awarded $44,738,  or 9.1 percent
of his base salary,  based 50 percent on earnings  performance and 50 percent on
an average of business unit Results Sharing awards.  Under the Executive  Annual
Incentive Plan in 1999, Mr. Russell earned an award of $699,372,  or 142 percent
of his base salary,  which  rewarded Mr.  Russell for  achieving  1999  earnings
results  significantly above target, as well as for achievement of non-financial
goals, all established by the Executive Compensation Committee.

         Mr. Russell's compensation also contains elements which motivate him to
focus  on the  longer-term  performance  of the  Company.  Under  the  Executive
Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan,  Mr. Russell was awarded annual target
opportunities  with a value equal to 80 percent of his base  salary.  This value
has been allocated 70 percent to stock options  awarded  annually and 30 percent
to  performance  shares  awarded in even-numbered  years.  The stock options and
performance  shares  have the same  characteristics  as  those  issued  to other
executive officers as described above. For the 4-year period ending December 31,
1999,  shareholders of the Company realized a Total  Shareholder  Return of 52.2
percent on their  investment,  ranking the Company number 10 among the 16-member
utility peer group. As a result, Mr. Russell earned performance shares equalling
62.5 percent of the target award.

MINNESOTA POWER COMMON STOCK PERFORMANCE

         The following graph compares the Company's cumulative Total Shareholder
Return on its Common Stock with the  cumulative  return of the S&P 500 Index and
the S&P Utilities Index, a capitalization-weighted  index of 26 stocks, which is
designed to measure the performance of the electric power utility company sector
of the S&P 500 Index.  The S&P 500 Index is a  capitalization-weighted  index of
500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through
changes  in the  aggregate  market  value of 500 stocks  representing  all major
industries.  Because  this  composite  index  has a  broad  industry  base,  its
performance may not closely track that of a composite index comprised  solely of
electric  utilities.  The calculations  assume a $100 investment on December 31,
1994 and reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date.
