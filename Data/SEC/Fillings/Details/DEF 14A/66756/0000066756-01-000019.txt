Dear Shareholder:

     You are  cordially  invited  to attend  ALLETE's  2001  Annual  Meeting  of
Shareholders  on  Tuesday,  May 8, 2001 at 10:00 a.m. in the  auditorium  at the
Duluth  Entertainment  Convention  Center  (DECC).  The DECC is  located  on the
waterfront  at 350 Harbor  Drive in Duluth.  Free  parking is  available  in the
adjoining lot. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I encourage you to attend.

     Our operating results in 2000 exceeded Company-wide goals for growth we set
for  ourselves  at the  beginning  of the  year.  Operating  earnings  per share
increased  by 12 percent,  beating our target of 10 percent.  Once again,  these
strong  results  were  driven in large part by our growing  Automotive  Services
unit. Our total shareholder  return (stock price  appreciation plus reinvestment
of dividends) was 54 percent. Shareholders joining us will hear our strategy for
growth in 2001.

     At the  Shareholders  Meeting,  11 nominees  will stand for election to the
Board.  Dutch  Cragun,  first  elected in 1991,  is retiring from service on the
Board. We thank him for his  contributions to the success of the Company.  Also,
shareholders will vote on a resolution to appoint  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
the Company's  independent  accountants.  Finally,  shareholders  will vote on a
resolution  to change the Company's  legal name from  Minnesota  Power,  Inc. to
ALLETE, Inc. The Company began doing business under the name ALLETE on September
1, 2000, as we were in the process of doubling the size of ADESA by acquiring 28
auto auctions.  Our electric  utility business unit  appropriately  continues to
operate under the name Minnesota Power.

     After our  Annual  Meeting,  we  invite  you to visit  with our  directors,
officers and employees  over a box lunch in the Lake Superior  Ballroom  located
within the DECC. If you plan to attend,  please return the enclosed  reservation
card.

     It is  important  that your shares be  represented  at the Annual  Meeting.
Please sign,  date and promptly  return the enclosed  proxy card in the envelope
provided, or, if applicable,  follow the easy instructions for phone or Internet
voting.

     Thank you for your investment in ALLETE.


                                                     Sincerely,



                                                     Edwin L. Russell

                                                     Edwin L. Russell
                                                     Chairman, President and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLICITATION

     The proxy  accompanying  this Proxy Statement is solicited on behalf of the
Board of  Directors  of ALLETE (the  Company)  for use at the Annual  Meeting of
Shareholders to be held on May 8, 2001 and any adjournments  thereof.  Minnesota
Power, Inc. began doing business under the name ALLETE on September 1, 2000. The
purpose  of the  meeting  is to elect a Board of 11  directors  to serve for the
ensuing year, to approve the  appointment of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP as the
Company's  independent  accountants for 2001, to approve  amending the Company's
Articles of  Incorporation  to change the  Company's  legal name from  Minnesota
Power, Inc. to ALLETE,  Inc. and to transact such other business as may properly
come before the meeting.  All properly  submitted  proxies received at or before
the meeting, and entitled to vote, will be voted at the meeting.

     This Proxy  Statement  and the enclosed  proxy card were first mailed on or
about March 16, 2001.  Each proxy  delivered  pursuant to this  solicitation  is
revocable  any time  before  it is  voted by  written  notice  delivered  to the
Secretary of the Company.

     The Company expects to solicit proxies primarily by mail.  Proxies also may
be  solicited  in  person and  by telephone at a nominal cost  by  employees  or
retirees  of the Company.  The  expenses of such  solicitation  are the ordinary
ones in connection with preparing, assembling and mailing the material, and also
include charges and expenses of brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees,
or  other   fiduciaries  for   communicating   with   shareholders.   Additional
solicitation  of  proxies  will be made by  mail,  telephone  and in  person  by
Corporate Investor Communications, Inc., a firm specializing in the solicitation
of proxies, at a cost to the Company of approximately $6,000 plus expenses.  The
total amount of such costs will be borne by the Company.

OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING PROCEDURES

     The outstanding  shares of capital stock of the Company as of March 9, 2001
were 75,625,063 shares of Common Stock (without par value).

     Each share of the Common Stock of record on the books of the Company at the
close of business  on March 9, 2001 is entitled to notice of the Annual  Meeting
and to one vote.

     The affirmative  vote of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote
at the  Annual  Meeting  is  required  for  election  of each  director  and the
affirmative  vote of a majority of the shares of stock  present and  entitled to
vote is  required  for  approval  of the other  items  described  in this  Proxy
Statement to be acted upon by shareholders.  An automated system administered by
Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,  N.A. tabulates the votes.  Abstentions are included
in determining  the number of shares present and voting and are treated as votes
against the particular proposal. Broker non-votes are not counted for or against
any proposal.

     Unless  contrary  instructions  are  indicated  on the  proxy,  all  shares
represented  by valid  proxies  will be voted "FOR" the election of all nominees
for director named herein, "FOR" approval of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP as the
Company's  independent  accountants for 2001, and "FOR" approval of amending the
Company's  Articles of  Incorporation  to change the  Company's  legal name from
Minnesota Power, Inc. to ALLETE, Inc. If any other business is transacted at the
meeting,  all shares  represented  by valid  proxies will be voted in accordance
with the best judgment of the appointed Proxies.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  requires
the Company's directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10
percent  of a  registered  class of the  Company's  equity  securities,  to file
reports of initial  ownership  of the  Company's  Common  Stock and other equity
securities  and  subsequent  changes in that  ownership  with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.  Based on a review of such
reports,  the Company believes that all such filing requirements were met during
2000  except  that one report  covering  four  transactions,  all related to the
exercise of Company stock  options,  was  inadvertently  filed less than a month
late by the Company on behalf of Ms. Brenda Flayton.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     On October 30, 2000,  the Company  loaned  James  Hallett,  Executive  Vice
President of ALLETE and President and CEO of ADESA Corporation,  $1 million with
interest  at a rate of 8 percent  per  annum,  so Mr.  Hallett  could  avoid the
distraction  of procuring  temporary  financing  and thereby  remain  focused on
leading ADESA as it was  integrating  major  acquisitions.  The loan was repaid,
with interest, on March 16, 2001.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS IN 2000

     During  2000  the  Board  of  Directors  held  5  meetings.  The  Executive
Committee,  which held 11 meetings during 2000,  provides oversight of corporate
financial matters,  performs the functions of a director  nominating  committee,
and is  authorized  to  exercise  the  authority  of the Board in the  intervals
between  meetings.  Shareholders  may  recommend  nominees  for  director to the
Executive Committee by addressing the Secretary of the Company, 30 West Superior
Street, Duluth,  Minnesota 55802. The Audit Committee,  which held 8 meetings in
2000, recommends the selection of independent accountants, reviews and evaluates
the Company's  accounting  practices,  reviews periodic  financial reports to be
provided to the public and reviews and  recommends  approval of the annual audit
report.  The Executive  Compensation  Committee,  which held 5 meetings in 2000,
establishes compensation and benefit arrangements for Company officers and other
key executives, intended to be equitable,  competitive with the marketplace, and
consistent with corporate objectives.  All directors attended 75 percent or more
of the  aggregate  number of meetings of the Board of Directors  and  applicable
committee meetings in 2000.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Employee directors receive no additional compensation for their services as
directors.  In 2000 the  Company  paid  each  non-employee  director  an  annual
retainer  fee of $5,000 and 1,300  shares of Common Stock under the terms of the
Company's Director Stock Plan. In addition,  each non-employee director was paid
$1,100 for each Board, Committee, and subsidiary board meeting attended,  except
that  $500 was  paid for  attendance  at a second  meeting  held the same day as
another meeting.  Each non-employee  director who is the Chairman of a Committee
received an additional $200 for each Committee meeting attended.  A $250 fee was
paid for all  conference  call  meetings.  Directors may elect to defer all or a
part of the cash  portion of their  retainer  and  meeting  fees.  The shares of
Common Stock paid to directors  with respect to 2000 had an average market price
of $17.24 per share.

     Under the Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive Plan  effective  January 1,
1996,  non-employee  directors  receive  automatic grants of 1,500 stock options
every year and performance  shares valued at $10,000 every other year. The stock
options vest 50 percent after the first year, the remaining 50 percent after the
second  year and  expire on the  tenth  anniversary  of the date of  grant.  The
exercise  price for each grant is the closing sale price of Company Common Stock
on the date of grant.  The  performance  periods for  performance  shares end on
December 31 of the year following the date of grant. Dividend equivalents in the
form of additional  performance  shares accrue during the performance period and
are paid only to the extent the underlying grant is earned. The performance goal
of each performance  period is based on Total Shareholder Return for the Company
in comparison to Total Shareholder Return for 16 diversified electric utilities.
Any awards  earned are paid out in Common Stock of the Company.  No  performance
period ended in 2000 and,  therefore,  no new awards were  earned.

PROPOSALS OF SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE 2002 ANNUAL MEETING

     All proposals from shareholders to be considered for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement  relating  to the Annual  Meeting  scheduled  for May 14, 2002 must be
received by the  Secretary of the Company at 30 West  Superior  Street,  Duluth,
Minnesota 55802,  not later than November 19, 2001. In addition,  the persons to
be named as proxies in the proxy cards  relating to that Annual Meeting may have
the  discretion to vote their proxies in accordance  with their  judgment on any
matter as to which the Company  did not have  notice  prior to February 5, 2002,
without discussion of such matter in the proxy statement relating to that Annual
Meeting.

<F1>  Options  vest 50  percent  on  January  3, 2001 and 50 percent on January 3, 2002. Options  granted to the top 7
      executives  of the  Company  include  a  replacement  option  feature  and  are  subject  to a  change-in-control
      acceleration  provision.  Replacement  options (also known as ownership  retention options or reload options) are
      intended to encourage share ownership.  They typically do not provide stock appreciation opportunity greater than
      the original  options.  In  addition,  they do not result in an increase in equity  position,  which is the total
      combined number of shares and options held. Replacement options are granted when the executive uses his shares of
      Common Stock to fund the exercise price of stock options. One replacement option is granted to replace each share
      that is  delivered  by the  executive as payment for the  purchase  price of shares  being  acquired  through the
      exercise  of a  stock  option.  Replacement  options  become  exercisable 12 months after  their  grant  date and
      terminate on the expiration  date of the option that they replace.  The exercise price of replacement  options is
      equal to the closing price of ALLETE's Common Stock on the grant date of the replacement options.
<F2>  The grant date dollar value of options is based on ALLETE's  binomial  ratio (as of  January  3,  2000) of .197.
      The  binomial  method  is  a  complicated   mathematical   formula  premised  on  immediate   exercisability  and
      transferability of the options, which are not features of the Company's options granted to executive officers and
      other employees. The values shown are theoretical and do not necessarily reflect the actual values the recipients
      may eventually realize.  Any actual value to the officer or other employee will depend on the extent to which the
      market value of the Company's Common Stock at a future date exceeds the exercise price. In addition to the option
      exercise  price,  and the 10-year term of each  option,  the  following  assumptions  for  modeling  were used to
      calculate the values shown for the options  granted in 2000:  expected  dividend yield of 5.633 percent (based on
      the most recent quarterly dividend),  expected stock price volatility of .200 (based on 250 trading days previous
      to January 3, 2000), a risk-free rate of return of 6.45 percent (based on Treasury yields).

     The table directly above reflects the number of shares of Common Stock that
can be earned pursuant to the Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation Plan
for the  2000-2001  performance  period if the Total  Shareholder  Return of the
Company (and, for business unit executives, other financial measures established
for business  units that  correlate  to Total  Shareholder  Return)  meets goals
established by the Executive  Compensation  Committee.  These goals are based on
the Company's ranking against a peer group of 16 diversified electric utilities.
Mr. Russell's threshold  performance share award will be earned if the Company's
Total  Shareholder  Return  ranks at least within the 3rd  quartile,  the target
award will be earned if the Company ranks in the 2nd  quartile,  and the maximum
award  will be  earned  if the  Company  ranks  in the 1st  quartile.  For  this
comparison the Total Shareholder Return ranking will be computed over the 2-year
period  January 1, 2000 through  December 31, 2001.  Twenty-five  percent of the
performance  share  award of the other  executives  in the table is based on the
foregoing,  and the remaining 75 percent is based on 2-year performance periods,
using other financial measures selected by the Executive  Compensation Committee
because of their correlation over time with Total Shareholder  Return.  Dividend
equivalents  accrue during the performance period and are paid in shares only to
the  extent  performance  goals are  achieved.  If  earned,  50  percent  of the
performance shares will be paid in Common Stock after the end of the performance
period;  the  remaining  50 percent  will be paid in Common  Stock on the second
anniversary of the end of the performance period.  Payment is accelerated upon a
change  in  control  of the  Company  at 200  percent  of the  target  number of
performance  shares  granted  as  increased  by  dividend  equivalents  for  the
performance period.

*Represents  the  highest  annualized  average  compensation  (salary and bonus) received  for 48  consecutive  months
 during the  employee's  last 15 years of service with the  Company. For  determination  of the pension  benefit,  the
 48-month  period for highest average  salary may be different  from the 48-month  period of highest  aggregate  bonus
 compensation.
</TABLE>

     Retirement benefit amounts shown are in the form of a straight-life annuity
to the  employee  and are based on amounts  listed in the  Summary  Compensation
Table under the headings Salary and Bonus.  Retirement benefit amounts shown are
not subject to any deduction for Social  Security or other offset  amounts.  The
Retirement  Plan  provides  that the benefit  amount at retirement is subject to
adjustment  in future  years to reflect  cost of living  increases  to a maximum
adjustment  of 3 percent  per year.  As of  December  31,  2000,  the  executive
officers  named in the Summary  Compensation  Table had the following  number of
years of credited service under the plan:

     Edwin L. Russell     6 years          Robert D. Edwards      24 years
     James P. Hallett     6 years          Donnie R. Crandell     20 years
     John E. Fuller       6 years

     With certain  exceptions,  the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended,
(Code)  restricts the aggregate amount of annual pension which may be paid to an
employee under the Retirement  Plan to $135,000 for 2000. This amount is subject
to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living increases. The Company's
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides for supplemental payments by the
Company to eligible  executives  (including the executive  officers named in the
Summary  Compensation  Table) in amounts sufficient to maintain total retirement
benefits  upon  retirement  at a level  which  would have been  provided  by the
Retirement Plan if benefits were not restricted by the Code.

REPORT OF BOARD'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Described below are the compensation policies of the Executive Compensation
Committee  of the Board of  Directors  effective  for 2000 with  respect  to the
executive  officers of the Company.  Composed  entirely of  independent  outside
directors,  the Executive Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending
to the Board  policies  which govern the executive  compensation  program of the
Company and for administering those policies.  Since 1995 the Board has retained
the  services  of William  M.  Mercer,  Incorporated  (Mercer),  a benefits  and
compensation  consulting firm, to assist the Executive Compensation Committee in
connection with the performance of such responsibilities.

     The role of the  executive  compensation  program  is to help  the  Company
achieve  its  corporate  goals by  motivating  performance,  rewarding  positive
results, and enhancing Total Shareholder Return.  Recognizing that the potential
impact an individual  employee has on the attainment of corporate goals tends to
increase at higher levels within the Company, the executive compensation program
provides  greater  variability  in  compensating  individuals  based on  results
achieved as their levels within the Company  rise.  In other words,  individuals
with the  greatest  potential  impact on  achieving  the  stated  goals have the
greatest  amount to gain when goals are achieved and the greatest amount at risk
when goals are not achieved.

     The program  recognizes  that,  in order to attract and retain  exceptional
executive talent needed to lead and grow the Company's businesses,  compensation
must be  competitive  in the  national  market.  To determine  market  levels of
compensation  for  executive  officers  in  2000,  the  Executive   Compensation
Committee relied upon comparative  information for general industrial  companies
provided or reviewed by Mercer.  The Committee  determined that,  because of the
Company's diversified operations,  general industry data is the most appropriate
market benchmark for the executive officers. All data were analyzed to determine
median  compensation  levels  for  comparable   positions  in  comparably  sized
companies, as measured by revenue. While the companies represented in the Mercer
survey data are not the same as those in the peer group used in the  performance
graph,  the Committee  believes that these  companies are appropriate for market
compensation comparison,  primarily because they are approximately the same size
as the Company as measured by revenue.

     Code Section 162(m) generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies
for  compensation  over  $1  million  paid  for any  fiscal  year to each of the
corporation's CEO and 4 other most highly  compensated  executive officers as of
the end of any fiscal year. Qualifying  performance-based  compensation will not
be subject to the  deduction  limit if certain  requirements  are met. The stock
options and  performance  shares  granted to the  executive  officers  under the
Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan are  intended  to qualify as
performance-based  compensation  within the meaning of Code  Section  162(m) and
should therefore be fully deductible for federal income tax purposes.

     As  described   below,   executive   officers  of  the  Company  receive  a
compensation  package  which  consists of three  basic  elements:  base  salary,
performance-based  compensation,  and supplemental executive benefits. The CEO's
compensation is discussed separately.

BASE SALARY

     Base  salaries  are  set at a  level  so  that,  if  the  target  level  of
performance is achieved under the  performance-based  plans as described  below,
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of the
performance-based  compensation  plans,  will be near  the  midpoint  of  market
compensation as described above.

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION

     The performance-based compensation plans of the Company are intended by the
Executive  Compensation  Committee to reward executives for achieving  financial
and  non-financial  goals  which the  Committee  determines  will be required to
achieve the Company's strategic and budgeted goals.

     Performance goals under  performance-based plans are established in advance
by the Executive  Compensation  Committee  and the Board of Directors.  A target
level of performance under the performance-based

                                       10

<PAGE>

plans generally meets budget or represents a Total Shareholder Return ranking in
the top half of the peer group  described  below.  Total  Shareholder  Return is
defined as stock price appreciation plus dividends reinvested on the ex-dividend
date  throughout  the relevant  performance  period,  divided by the fair market
value  of a share  at the  beginning  of the  performance  period.  With  target
performance,  plus the value of stock options  granted,  executive  compensation
will be near the midpoint of the relevant market.  If no performance  awards are
earned, and no value is attributed to the stock options granted, compensation of
the  Company's  executive  officers  would be  significantly  below the midpoint
market  compensation  level,  while  performance at increments  above the target
level will result in total compensation above the midpoint of the market.

         The Company's performance-based compensation plans include:

     -   RESULTS SHARING.  The Results Sharing award opportunity  rewards annual
         performance of the executive's  responsibility  area as well as overall
         corporate  performance.  Awards are  available to all  employees in the
         electric,  water and  corporate  groups  on the same  percentage-of-pay
         basis.  Target  financial  performance  will  result  in an  award of 5
         percent of base salary, assuming non-financial goals established by the
         Executive Compensation Committee are also accomplished.

     -   EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN. The Executive Annual Incentive Plan is
         intended to focus executive  attention on meeting and exceeding  annual
         financial  and  non-financial  business unit goals  established  by the
         Executive  Compensation  Committee.  For  2000,  financial  goals  were
         business unit  contributions  to net income,  operating cash returns on
         investment,  operating  free cash flow,  and earnings per share.  These
         financial  performance measures were chosen by the Committee because of
         their positive  correlation over time with the Total Shareholder Return
         achieved by the Company for its shareholders.  Target level performance
         is earned if budgeted financial results are achieved. The results shown
         on the Summary  Compensation Table reflect  substantially  above-budget
         financial operating performance of the Company in 2000.

     -   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP). Under the Executive Long-Term
         Incentive   Compensation   Plan  implemented  in  1996,  the  executive
         officers,  other than the CEO, of the Company have been  awarded  stock
         options  annually  and  performance  shares  biennially  having  in the
         aggregate  target award values ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent of
         their base  salaries.  The value of the award  opportunity is allocated
         between stock options and  performance  shares.  The stock options will
         have value only if the Common Stock price appreciates.  The performance
         shares  granted to the  corporate  group have value if, in 2 years from
         the grant date,  the Total  Shareholder  Return of the Company,  over a
         2-year  performance  measurement  period  determined  in advance by the
         Board of Directors,  ranks at least in the 3rd quartile of a peer group
         of  16  diversified   electric   utilities  adopted  by  the  Executive
         Compensation Committee as appropriate comparators.  Twenty-five percent
         of the performance  share award to business unit executives is based on
         the  foregoing  ranking,  and 75  percent  is based on other  financial
         measures  selected by the Committee  because of their  correlation over
         time with Total  Shareholder  Return.  Dividend  equivalents  accrue on
         performance shares during the performance period and are paid in Common
         Stock only to the extent  performance  goals are achieved.  The maximum
         payout is 200 percent of the target award.  If earned,  the performance
         shares  will be paid in Common  Stock with 50 percent of the award paid
         after the end of the performance  period,  and the remaining 50 percent
         on the second  anniversary  thereof.  The LTIP payout for 2000 shown in
         the Summary  Compensation  Table includes a payout of 25 percent of the
         award earned for the  performance  period ending  December 31, 1999, 50
         percent of which was reported for 1999.

         The Executive  Compensation  Committee has determined that these awards
are  consistent  with  its philosophy of aligning executive  officers' interests
with those of shareholders and to the performance of the Company.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE BENEFITS

     The Company has established a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
to compensate certain employees,  including the executive officers, equitably by
replacing  benefits not provided by the Company's  Flexible Benefit Plan and the
Employee Stock  Ownership Plan due to  government-imposed  limits and to provide
retirement benefits which are competitive with those offered by other businesses
with which the Company  competes for  executive  talent.  The SERP also provides
employees whose salaries exceed the salary  limitations for tax-qualified  plans
imposed by the Code with additional benefits such that they receive in aggregate
the benefits they would have been entitled to receive had such  limitations  not
been imposed.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     The Executive  Compensation Committee has endeavored to provide Mr. Russell
with a compensation  package that is at the 50th percentile of compensation paid
by general  industrial  companies  with revenue  comparable to the Company.  The
Committee has designed Mr. Russell's compensation package to provide substantial
incentive to achieve and exceed the Board's financial  performance goals for the
Company and Total Shareholder Return goals for the Company's shareholders.

     In June 2000, the Board of Directors  increased Mr.  Russell's  annual base
salary 7.7 percent.  Approximately  half of this  increase was to align his base
salary with the median of comparably  sized companies and the other half related
to his  contributions  to the  performance  of the Company.  Under the Company's
Results  Sharing Plan,  Mr. Russell was awarded  $38,559,  or 7.3 percent of his
base  salary,  based 50 percent  on  earnings  performance  and 50 percent on an
average of business unit Results  Sharing  awards.  Under the  Executive  Annual
Incentive Plan in 2000, Mr. Russell earned an award of $725,040,  or 137 percent
of his base salary,  which  rewarded Mr.  Russell for  achieving  2000  earnings
results  significantly above target, as well as for achievement of non-financial
goals, all established by the Executive Compensation Committee.

     Mr.  Russell's  compensation  also contains  elements which motivate him to
focus  on the  longer-term  performance  of the  Company.  Under  the  Executive
Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan,  Mr. Russell was awarded annual target
opportunities  with a value equal to 80 percent of his base  salary.  This value
has been allocated 70 percent to stock options  awarded  annually and 30 percent
to performance  shares  awarded in  even-numbered  years.  The stock options and
performance  shares  have the same  characteristics  as  those  issued  to other
executive  officers as  described  above.  The LTIP payout for 2000 shown in the
Summary  Compensation  Table includes a payout of 25 percent of the award earned
for the  performance  period  ending  December 31, 1999, 50 percent of which was
reported for 1999.

     In fiscal  2000,  the  Company  provided  Mr.  Russell a split  dollar life
insurance arrangement insuring his life. This insurance program is structured so
that all the premium  contributions are returned to the Company at Mr. Russell's
attaining age 71 or at death if earlier. The arrangement covers an 8-year period
beginning  January 1, 2000 and provides that if Mr.  Russell leaves prior to the
end of such period, Company funding of this program will be reduced accordingly.
This  arrangement  is  provided  as an  incentive  for Mr.  Russell's  continued
employment and is in lieu of other retention considerations  investigated by the
Executive Compensation Committee.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of 4 independent,
non-employee  directors,  assists  the  Board  in  carrying  out  its  oversight
responsibilities  for the Company's financial  reporting process,  audit process
and internal controls. The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth
in the Audit Committee Charter which is reproduced in the appendix of this Proxy
Statement.  The Audit Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors
(i) that the audited  financial  statements be included in the Company's  Annual
Report  on  Form  10-K;  and  (ii)  the  selection  of  the  independent  public
accountants to audit the books and records of the Company.

     The Audit  Committee  (i)  reviewed and  discussed  the  Company's  audited
financial  statements  for the year ending  December 31, 2000 with the Company's
management  and  with  the  Company's  independent  accountants;  (ii)  met with
management to discuss all financial  statements  prior to their  issuance and to
discuss  significant  accounting  issues;  (iii)  discussed  with the  Company's
independent  accountants  the  matters  required  to  be  discussed  by  SAS  61
(Codification of Statements on Auditing  Standards) which includes,  among other
items,  matters  related to the conduct of the audit of the Company's  financial
statements;  and (iv)  received and discussed  the written  disclosures  and the
letter from the  Company's  independent  accountants  required  by  Independence
Standards Board Statement No. 1 (Independence discussions with audit committees)
which relates to the accountants'  independence  from the Company.  Based on the
review and  discussions  with management and the  independent  accountants,  the
Committee  recommended  to the Board of  Directors  that the  audited  financial
statements be included in the Company's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ending December 31, 2000 for filing with the SEC.

     Management has advised the Audit Committee that for the year ended December
31, 2000,  the Company paid fees to  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP for services in
the following categories:

                   Audit Fees                    $1.4 million

                   All Other Fees                $1.5 million

     All Other Fees in the foregoing  table  include $1.1 million for tax advice
and tax return assistance.  We have considered and determined that the provision
of the  non-audit  services  noted  in  the  foregoing table  is compatible with
maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence.

ALLETE COMMON STOCK PERFORMANCE

     The following  graph compares the Company's  cumulative  Total  Shareholder
Return on its Common Stock with the  cumulative  return of the S&P 500 Index and
the S&P Utilities Index, a capitalization-weighted  index of 26 stocks, which is
designed to measure the performance of the electric power utility company sector
of the S&P 500 Index.  The S&P 500 Index is a  capitalization-weighted  index of
500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through
changes  in the  aggregate  market  value of 500 stocks  representing  all major
industries.  Because  this  composite  index  has a  broad  industry  base,  its
performance may not closely track that of a composite index comprised  solely of
electric  utilities.  The calculations  assume a $100 investment on December 31,
1995 and reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date.

               ITEM NO. 2 - APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  has
recommended  the  appointment  of  PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP  as  independent
accountants  for the Company for the year 2001.  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP has
acted in this capacity since October 1963.

     A  representative  of the  accounting  firm will be  present  at the Annual
Meeting of  Shareholders,  will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or
she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

     In connection with the 2000 audit,  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reviewed the
Company's annual report, examined the related financial statements, and reviewed
interim  financial  statements  and certain of the  Company's  filings  with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" approving the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent accountants for 2001.

ITEM NO. 3 - AMEND THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE COMPANY'S LEGAL
             NAME FROM MINNESOTA POWER, INC. TO ALLETE, INC.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The  Board  of  Directors   proposes   that  the   Company's   Articles  of
Incorporation  be  amended  to change the  Company's  legal name from  Minnesota
Power,  Inc.  to ALLETE,  Inc. On  September  1, 2000,  the Company  began doing
business under the name ALLETE and began trading under the symbol ALE on the New
York Stock  Exchange.  The new name  reflects  the  Company's  evolution  from a
Minnesota  electric  utility  to a  diversified,  multi-services  business  with
operations  across North  America.  We are clearly more than  Minnesota and more
than power.  The Company's  electric  utility business unit continues to operate
under the name Minnesota Power.

     The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the proposed amendment.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 OTHER BUSINESS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Board of Directors  does not know of any other business to be presented
at the meeting.  However, if any other matters properly come before the meeting,
it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying  proxy card to vote
pursuant to the proxies in accordance with their judgment in such matters.

     All shareholders are asked to promptly return their proxy in order that the
necessary vote may be present at the meeting.  We respectfully  request that you
sign and return the accompanying proxy card at your earliest convenience.

               CHARTER - AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
                          (Effective January 17, 2000)

PURPOSE
- -------

The Audit Committee's  primary function is to assist the Board in fulfilling its
oversight  responsibilities by reviewing the financial information which will be
provided to the shareholders and others,  the system of internal  controls which
management and the Board of Directors have established, and the audit process.


ORGANIZATION
- ------------

The  Audit  Committee  shall  be  composed  of at  least  3  Directors  who  are
independent of the  management of the Company and are free of any  relationships
with the Company that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere
with their exercise of independent  judgment as a Committee  member.  At least 1
member of the Committee  shall have accounting or related  financial  management
expertise.


PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES
- ------------------------

As delegated by the Board of Directors:

1.       Review  the form  and  content  of the  annual  consolidated  financial
         statements  and  determine  whether   management  and  the  independent
         accountants  are in  agreement  that  the  proposed  audited  financial
         statements,  including  all  necessary  disclosures,  were  prepared in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  consistently
         applied.  Review  filings  with the SEC and other  published  documents
         containing the Company's consolidated financial statements and consider
         whether the information contained in these documents is consistent with
         the  information  contained  in the  financial  statements.  Review the
         quality of financial  reporting with the independent  accountants;  for
         example,  clarity of financial disclosures and degree of aggressiveness
         or conservatism in the Company's accounting principles.

2.       Review quarterly and other financial reports and disclosures before
         they are filed with the SEC.

3.       Review with management,  the independent accountants,  and the Director
         of Internal Audit the adequacy of the Company's internal controls,  any
         significant  changes in accounting  policies,  procedures or practices,
         and compliance with Corporate policies, directives and applicable laws.

4.       Assess  the  qualifications,   independence,  and  performance  of  the
         Company's independent accountants. Review formal written statement from
         the outside auditors delineating all relationships  between the auditor
         and  the   Company;   actively   discuss  and  resolve  any   disclosed
         relationships   or  services  that  may  impact  the   objectivity  and
         independence  of  the  auditor.  Recommend  annually  to the  Board  of
         Directors the independent accounting firm to be nominated.

5.       Review and concur with management in the appointment, replacement,
         reassignment or dismissal of the Director of Internal Audit.

                                       16


<PAGE>


6.       Review the independent accountants' scope and results of their annual
         and special audits. Recommend the acceptance of such audits where
         accompanied by certification.

7.       Review with the Director of Internal Audit the annual audit plan and
         scope of internal audits.

8.       Review the action taken by management on the internal auditors' and
         independent accountants' recommendations.

9.       Provide sufficient opportunity for the internal and independent
         auditors to meet with the members of the Audit Committee without
         members of management present.

10.      Prepare a report for  inclusion  in the  annual  proxy  statement  that
         specifies  the  Directors  who  sit on  the  Committee,  describes  the
         Committee's responsibilities as outlined in this Charter, and discusses
         how these responsibilities were discharged during the year.
