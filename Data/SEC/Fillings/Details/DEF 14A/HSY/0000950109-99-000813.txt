  Directors who are employees of the Corporation receive no remuneration for
their services as directors.
 
  One-third of the annual retainer must be paid in Common Stock. The remainder
may be taken in cash or Common Stock (meeting and chair fees are payable in
cash only). A director may also defer receipt of the retainer and meeting fees
until their retirement as a director.
 
  All directors are reimbursed for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of the Board and
its committees and for minor incidental expenses incurred in connection with
performance of directors' services. In addition, directors are provided with
travel accident insurance while traveling on the Corporation's business;
receive the same discounts as employees on the purchase of the Corporation's
products; and are eligible to participate in the Corporation's Higher
Education Gift Matching Program.
 
  The Corporation maintains a Directors' Charitable Award Program for
individuals who became directors prior to December 31, 1996. This program is a
self-funded life insurance program on the directors and funds charitable
donations by the Corporation to educational institutions designated by the
directors. The amount of the donation varies according to the director's
length of service as a director, up to a maximum donation of $1,000,000 after
five years of service. Seven current directors and ten retired directors
participate in the program. The amount of the charitable donation per current
participating director is $1,000,000, except for Mr. Alexander, Mr. Campbell,
Dr. Evarts and Mr. McDonald for whom the current amount is $600,000, because
of their shorter length of service as directors.

                    Proposal No. 2--APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS
 
  The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, has
appointed Arthur Andersen LLP as independent public accountants of the
Corporation for the year ending December 31, 1999. Although not required to do
so, the Board of Directors is submitting the appointment of that firm for
approval at the Annual Meeting. Arthur Andersen LLP has audited the
Corporation's financial statements since 1927 and is considered to be well
qualified. If the appointment is not approved, the Board of Directors will
reconsider its appointment. Representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP will be
present at the meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they so
desire and will be available to respond to questions.
 
  The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes represented at the meeting
in person or by proxy of the Common Stock and Class B Stock voting together
without regard to class is required for approval of the appointment of
auditors.
 
  The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR Proposal No. 2, and proxies
which are returned will be so voted unless a contrary vote is designated.
 
                               VOTING SECURITIES
 
  The Corporation has shares of two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock
and Class B Stock. At the close of business on March 1, 1999, the record date
for the Annual Meeting, there were outstanding 109,262,899 shares of Common
Stock, and 30,446,908 shares of Class B Stock, all of which are entitled to
vote. Holders of record of the Corporation's Common Stock on March 1, 1999
will be entitled to cast one vote for each share held, and holders of record
of the Class B Stock on March 1, 1999 will be entitled to cast ten votes for
each share held. The Common Stock is entitled to cash dividends 10% higher
than those declared on the Class B Stock.
 
  According to the Corporation's By-Laws, the presence in person or by proxy
of the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast of the
outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock, respectively, shall constitute
quorums for matters to be voted on separately by the Common Stock as a class
and the Class B Stock as a class. The presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the combined
outstanding shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock shall constitute
a quorum for matters to be voted on without regard to class.
 
  The vote required for approval of any matter which may be the subject of a
vote of the stockholders is provided for in the Corporation's Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate"), and By-Laws. The
specific vote requirements for the proposals being submitted to a stockholder
vote at this year's Annual Meeting are set forth under the description of each
proposal in this Proxy Statement.
 
  Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. For the purpose of
determining whether a proposal (except for the election of directors) has
received a majority vote, abstentions will be included in the vote totals with
the result that an abstention will have the same effect as a negative vote. In
instances where brokers are prohibited from exercising discretionary authority
for beneficial owners who have not returned a proxy (broker non-votes), those
shares will not be included in the vote totals and, therefore, will have no
effect on the vote.

                          1998 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
           Compensation and Executive Organization Committee Report
                           on Executive Compensation
 
  The Compensation and Executive Organization Committee of the Board of
Directors ("Committee") is composed entirely of non-employee directors, and is
responsible for the establishment and oversight of the Corporation's executive
compensation program.
 
Executive Compensation Philosophy
 
  The Corporation's executive compensation program is designed to meet the
following objectives:
 
    To connect the interests of the executive officers with corporate
    performance and the interests of stockholders;
 
    To attract, retain and motivate executive talent;
 
    To assure that a significant portion of the executive officers' total
    compensation is dependent upon the appreciation of the Corporation's
    Common Stock; and
 
    To provide a balanced total compensation package that recognizes the
    individual contributions of the executive officers and the overall
    business results of the Corporation.
 
  Each year the Committee conducts a full review of the Corporation's
executive compensation program. The annual compensation review permits an
ongoing evaluation of the link between the Corporation's performance and its
executive compensation in the context of the compensation programs of other
companies. This review is performed periodically with the assistance of an
independent outside consultant whose services are retained by the Corporation.
The Committee reserves the right to select and/or meet independently with any
consultant at its discretion. This annual review includes analyzing survey
data comparing the competitiveness of the Corporation's executive
compensation, corporate performance, stock price appreciation and total return
to stockholders with a peer group of companies representing the Corporation's
most direct food industry competitors for executive talent. The Committee also
considers compensation data compiled from surveys of a broader group of
general industry companies, some of which are from the food industry. In the
performance graph on page 21, the Corporation's performance is compared to the
Standard and
 
                                      11
<PAGE>
 
Poor's Food Group Index. The peer group considered relevant for the
Corporation's compensation comparison purposes does not include all of the
companies in the Food Group Index as compensation data on all such companies
is not readily available. Also, the peer group includes some companies that
are not in this index because the Corporation selects those companies it
believes to be the most relevant and direct competitors for executive talent.
The Committee reviews which peer companies are selected for compensation
analysis.
 
  In the review of survey data, a statistical process involving regression
analysis is used to determine competitive compensation levels. This approach
adjusts compensation levels for factors such as net sales, return on equity,
and time in position within the organization in determining predicted values
or "going rates" within the marketplace for each element of compensation. The
Corporation targets total compensation "at or above" such "going rates."
 
  As a result of this review and other considerations, the Corporation took
several actions throughout 1998 to adjust the executive compensation program
described herein. First, the survey results reviewed by the Committee showed
that over the past three years there has been a shortfall, versus competitive
peer group companies, in the long-term portion of the Corporation's executive
compensation program. To address this shortfall, the Committee made a
supplemental grant of stock options in February to key executives of the
Corporation. The Corporation's Supplemental Executive Retirement Program was
amended to revise the interest rate and mortality factors used to calculate
lump sum payments under the plan and to require participants to give advance
notice of their retirement in order to receive a lump sum distribution.
Finally, the Corporation's Key Employee Incentive Plan ("Incentive Plan") was
amended to increase the authorized number of shares.
 
  The Committee believes the holding of significant equity interests in the
Corporation by management aligns the interests of stockholders and management.
Through the programs described in this report, a very significant portion of
each executive officer's total compensation is linked directly to individual
and corporate performance and stock price appreciation.
 
  The key elements of the Corporation's executive compensation program consist
of base salary, an annual cash incentive program, and a long-term incentive
program consisting of performance stock units and stock options. Incentives
play an important role in motivating executive performance and in aligning
executive pay practices with the interests of the stockholders. The
Corporation's executive compensation program is intended to reward achievement
of both short-term and long-term business goals. To ensure proper balance in
the achievement of these business objectives, the incentive program places
greater dollars at risk in long-term incentives compared to short-term
incentives. The long-term incentive program is especially designed to assure
that the Corporation's executive officers have a significant portion of their
total compensation tied to factors which affect the performance of the
Corporation's Common Stock.
 
  The Committee determined the total compensation of K. L. Wolfe, Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and it reviewed and approved the total
compensation of the most highly-compensated executive officers, including the
individuals whose compensation is detailed in this Proxy Statement. This is
designed to ensure consistency throughout the executive compensation program.
 
  The Committee's policies with respect to each of the elements of the
executive compensation program, including the basis for the compensation
awarded to Mr. Wolfe, are discussed below. While the elements of compensation
are described separately below, the Committee considers the total compensation
package afforded by the Corporation when determining each component of the
executive officer's compensation, including pension benefits, supplemental
retirement benefits, insurance and other benefits.

Base Salaries
 
  Base salaries for new executive officers are initially determined by
evaluating the responsibilities of the position held and the experience of the
individual, and by reference to the salaries paid in the competitive
marketplace for executive talent, including a comparison of base salaries for
comparable positions at other companies.
 
  Salary reviews are conducted annually and salary adjustments are made based
upon the performance of the Corporation and of each executive officer and
their position in the applicable salary grade. The Committee considers both
financial and, where appropriate, non-financial performance measures in making
salary adjustments. Base salaries for executive officers and all other
salaried employees are set within salary ranges established for the position
as determined through the annual competitive salary surveys described above.
In the case of executive officers with responsibility for a particular
business unit, such unit's financial results are also considered.
 
  With respect to the base salary granted to Mr. Wolfe in 1998, the Committee
made a favorable assessment of the Corporation's actual business results
versus plan goals and the results achieved by Mr. Wolfe on various objectives
the Committee established in 1997. The Committee also considered Mr. Wolfe's
relative position in his salary grade. Based on these factors, the Committee
increased Mr. Wolfe's salary by $75,000, an 11.4 % increase.
 
Annual Incentive Program
 
  The Corporation's executive officers, as well as other key management and
professional employees, are eligible for an annual cash incentive award under
the Annual Incentive Program ("AIP") of the Incentive Plan. Participating
executive officers are eligible to earn individual awards expressed as a
percentage of base salary.
 
  The final award is the product of the executive officer's base salary, the
applicable target percentage, a corporate or business unit performance score
and an individual performance score. Individual and short-term (annual)
corporate and business unit performance objectives are established at the
beginning of each year by the Committee. For executive officers at the
corporate level, the performance objectives for AIP award payments for 1998
were based on financial measures including earnings per share, economic value
added, free cash flow and the results of the implementation of an enterprise-
wide information system. For executive officers at the business unit and
shared service level, the performance objectives for 1998 were varying
combinations of consolidated earnings per share, economic value added, free
cash flow, business unit operating income and various sales growth and market
share objectives. Adjustments are made to the performance results, if
necessary, to take into account extraordinary or unusual items occurring
during the performance year. Since the final award is the product of the
factors described above, the corporate or business unit performance and
individual performance scores are given equal weight in the formula.
Performance scores in excess of the objectives for financial measures and/or
individual performance expectations may result in the individual executive
officer receiving more than his/her target percentage. The maximum corporate
or business unit performance score for a plan participant is 175%. The maximum
score on the individual performance score is 120%. The applicable individual
performance score for the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
and Vice Chairman is 120% with the Committee having discretion to adjust this
percentage downward. Guidelines have been established which in certain
instances limit the personal performance score in relationship to the
corporate or business unit scores. The range of the target percentages of base
salary used in 1998 for annual cash incentive awards for executive officers
was 25% to 60%, with the highest rate of 60% applicable only to Mr. Wolfe.
 
  No annual cash incentive awards are granted unless a specific corporate
performance level is achieved. This performance level is defined as the
minimum rate of return which average total
 
                                      13
<PAGE>
 
invested capital must earn before any awards are paid. This is designed with
the stockholders' interest in mind by assuring the Corporation achieves
certain profitability levels before any executive is granted an annual
incentive award.
 
  In 1998, corporate-level participants (which included Mr. Wolfe) in the AIP
partially achieved the corporate performance objectives set for earnings per
share, free cash flow, economic value added and implementation of the
enterprise-wide information system. Based on these results, Mr. Wolfe was
awarded a 1998 annual cash incentive award of $359,944.
 
Long-Term Incentive Program--Performance Stock Units
 
  Performance stock units (PSUs) were contingently granted in 1998 under the
Incentive Plan to members of the Corporation's senior executive group most in
a position to affect the Corporation's long-term results (a combined total of
22 individuals in 1998). PSU grants are based upon a percent of the
executive's annual salary. PSUs are granted every year and are earned based on
the Corporation's performance over a three-year cycle. Each year begins a new
three-year cycle. Provided the Corporation has achieved the established
performance objectives at the end of the three-year cycle, a payment is made,
either in stock, cash or a combination of both, based on the market value of
the shares at the end of the cycle. In determining whether performance
objectives have been achieved, specified adjustments established by the
Committee can be made to the corporate performance to take into account
extraordinary or unusual items occurring during the performance cycle. Payment
may be deferred to a later date at the election of the executive. The value of
each of the PSUs is tied to corporate performance (in determining what
percentage of shares are earned) and stock price appreciation. The established
performance measures are earnings per share, economic value added and
cumulative free cash flow. The performance scores can range from 0% to 150%.
 
  The Corporation has minimum stockholding guidelines for its executive
officers and certain other key managerial and professional employees of the
Corporation which require these individuals to accumulate gradually over time
shares of Common Stock and/or deferred PSUs. The value equivalent of the
shares which must be acquired and held is equal to a multiple of the
individual's base salary. Minimum stockholding requirements for executive
officers range from three to five times base salary. If the minimum has not
been met, the executive officer is required to take the PSU award in Common
Stock (net of withholding taxes) or deferred PSUs. For Mr. Wolfe, the
applicable multiple in 1998 was five times his base salary.
 
  In January 1996, each eligible member of the senior executive group was
granted PSUs having a value at the time of grant equal to a percentage of
their annual salary. This percentage was determined by the Committee based on
the recommendation of senior management and competitive survey information.
The performance objectives established for the grant for earnings per share,
return on net assets and cumulative free cash flow were exceeded for the
period ended December 31, 1998. Accordingly, Mr. Wolfe's award was valued at
$1,456,946 based on the December 1998 average value of the PSUs from the 1996
grant.
 
  In January 1998, eligible members of the senior executive group were granted
new contingent PSUs. The grants were consistent with past practices. The
"Long-Term Incentive Program Performance Stock Unit Awards in Year Ended--
December 31, 1998" table in this Proxy Statement provides additional
information regarding these grants for the five most highly-compensated
executive officers.
 
Long-Term Incentive Program--Stock Options
 
  Under the Incentive Plan, stock options are periodically granted to the
Corporation's senior executive group as well as to other key management and
professional employees. Stock options entitle
 
                                      14
<PAGE>
 
the holder to purchase during a specified time period a fixed number of shares
of Common Stock at a set price.
 
  The Committee sets guidelines for the number of stock options to be granted
based on competitive compensation data gathered from survey information
discussed above. The number of stock options granted is a function of the
employee's base pay, stock option multiples for the employee's grade level and
the imputed value of the option. The Committee also takes into account
management's recommendations regarding the number of options to be awarded to
specific employees as well as competitive pay practices within the food
industry and the amount of options outstanding or previously granted. While
stock options have been granted annually to members of the senior executive
group, the Committee can elect not to grant stock options in a given year.
Stock option recipients other than the senior executive group (over 500 key
employees) generally receive stock option grants every two years.
 
  Minimum stockholding requirements are applicable to stock options granted
after 1995. If the minimums are not satisfied, an individual can receive only
one-half of the after-tax profit from the option exercise in cash. The
remaining one-half of the profit must be retained in Common Stock. Minimum
stockholding requirements range from one to five times base salary. For Mr.
Wolfe, the applicable multiple in 1998 was five times his base salary.
 
  Stock options are designed to align the interests of executives with those
of the stockholders. Stock options are granted with a ten-year term and an
exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Common Stock on the
day preceding the date of grant. Starting in 1997, options granted to the
senior executive group have a two-year vesting requirement similar to that
already applicable to the non-senior management group receiving options. This
approach is designed as an incentive for future performance by the creation of
stockholder value over the long-term since the benefit of the stock options
cannot be realized unless stock price appreciation occurs.
 
  In 1998, Mr. Wolfe received options to purchase 42,000 shares of Common
Stock with an exercise price of $61.50 per share and 15,000 shares of Common
Stock with an exercise price of $63.6875, the closing market price on the day
preceding the grants.
 
Policy Regarding Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation
 
  Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") provides
that publicly-held companies may be limited in deducting certain compensation
in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and the four other
most highly-compensated officers. The Committee has considered the effect of
Section 162(m) of the Code on the Corporation's executive compensation program
to develop its policy with respect to the deductibility of the Corporation's
executive compensation. It is the Committee's position that in administering
the "performance based" portion of the Corporation's executive compensation
program, it will attempt to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m).
However, the Committee believes that it needs to retain the flexibility to
exercise its judgment in assessing an executive's performance and that the
total compensation system for executive officers should be managed in
accordance with the objectives outlined in the "Executive Compensation
Philosophy" section of this report and in the best overall interest of the
Corporation's stockholders. Should compliance with Section 162(m) conflict
with the "Executive Compensation Philosophy" or with what the Committee
believes to be in the best interest of the stockholders, the Committee will
act in accordance with the Philosophy and in the best interest of the
stockholders, notwithstanding the effect of such action on deductibility for
any given year. However, to assure that the Corporation does not lose
deductions for compensation paid, the Committee has adopted a deferral policy
requiring the executive to defer receipt of any compensation in excess of $1
million that is not deductible in any given year to the year in which such
compensation would be deductible by the Corporation.

Conclusion
 
  In 1998, as in previous years, a substantial portion of the Corporation's
executive compensation consisted of performance-based variable elements. In
the case of Mr. Wolfe, approximately 71% of his 1998 total compensation
consisted of performance-based variable elements, without including stock
options in the computation. The Committee intends to continue the policy of
linking executive compensation to corporate performance and returns to
stockholders.

  (/1/) All stock options listed in this column are subject to a two-year
        vesting period and have a ten-year term. The stock options having a
        $61.50 exercise price were granted on January 19, 1998 and stock
        options having a $63.6875 price were granted on February 3, 1998 and
        were granted at a price not less than 100% of the fair market value of
        the Common Stock on the date of grant determined as the closing price
        on the business day immediately preceding the date the stock options
        were granted. All stock options expire at the end of the stock option
        holder's employment, except in the case of a stock option held by an
        employee whose employment ends due to retirement, total disability or
        death, in which instance the employee or his estate may exercise the
        stock option within five years of the date of retirement, total
        disability or death (three years for options granted prior to 1997).
 
  (/2/) In 1998, 501 employees were granted a total of 1,739,050 stock options.
 
  (/3/) The exercise price may be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock valued
        at the fair market value on the date of exercise, or pursuant to a
        cashless exercise procedure under which the stock option holder
        provides irrevocable instructions to a brokerage firm to sell the
        purchased shares and to remit to the Corporation, out of the sales
        proceeds, an amount equal to the exercise price plus all applicable
        withholding taxes.
 
  (/4/) The dollar amounts under these columns for all the individuals are the
        result of annual appreciation rates for the term of the options (10
        years) as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and,
        therefore, are not intended to forecast possible future appreciation,
        if any, of the price of the Common Stock.

  (/5/) For "All Stockholders," the potential realizable value on 142,914,431
        shares, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B
        Stock on January 19, 1998, is based on a $61.50 per share price and on
        February 3, 1998, is based on a $63.6875 per share price (the exercise
        prices of the 1998 options). The value of the Common Stock and Class B
        Stock at $61.50 per share was $8,789,237,507 and at $63.6875 per share
        was $9,101,862,824. If the calculation was based on the share price on
        February 3, 1998 of $63.6875 the potential realizable value for all
        stockholders of a 5% appreciation would be $5,724,112,624 and at 10%
        appreciation would be $14,506,025,249. The amounts listed under these
        columns for "All Stockholders" are the result of annual appreciation
        rates for a period of ten years from January 19, 1998 through January
        19, 2008 and February 3, 1998 through February 3, 2008. The amounts are
        not intended to forecast possible future appreciation, if any, of the
        price of the Common Stock.

  (/1/) The PSUs reported in this table were granted on January 19, 1998 for
        the cycle commencing January 1, 1998 and ending December 31, 2000.
 
    For purposes of determining the number of grants, the value of each PSU
    is based on the average of the daily closing prices of the Common Stock
    on the New York Stock Exchange as reported in The Wall Street Journal for
    the December preceding the new three-year performance cycle.
 
    The final value of the award is determined based upon three factors. The
    first is the number of PSUs awarded at the commencement of the three-year
    cycle. The second factor relates to the performance score as measured
    against predetermined earnings per share, economic value added and
    cumulative free cash flow objectives for the 1998-00 three-year cycle.
    The performance scoring can range from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of
    150% achievement. The third factor involves the value per unit which is
    determined at the conclusion of the three-year cycle.
 
  (/2/) This column lists the number of shares of Common Stock, the value of
        which would be payable to the named executives at the threshold
        achievement level of 8 1/3%. If the achievement level at the end of the
        three-year cycle is less than this threshold, no payments are made.
 
  (/3/) This column lists the number of shares of Common Stock, the value of

Benefit Protection Arrangements
 
  In August 1994, the Corporation entered into severance agreements
("Severance Agreements") with the five executive officers named in the Summary
Compensation Table and other key management personnel. The terms of these
Severance Agreements are consistent with the practices followed by other major
public corporations in the U.S. and provide that in the event the executive's
employment with the Corporation is terminated without "cause" within two years
after a "change in control" of the Corporation, the executive is entitled to
certain severance payments and benefits. A "change in control" is defined to
include an event in which the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer holds
voting control of the Corporation and another party acquires 25% or more of
the combined voting power or common equity of the Corporation. Under the terms
of the Severance Agreements, upon the executive's termination after a change
in control as described above, and in order to assist the executive in
transitioning to new employment, the executive generally would be entitled to
receive in a lump sum three times the executive's base salary and annual
incentive bonus. The executive would also be entitled to continuation of
health benefits for such period and reimbursement for federal excise taxes
payable (but not for income taxes payable). The executive would also become
vested in benefits under existing compensation and benefit programs (including
those described in this Executive Compensation section) and would generally be
paid such benefits at the time of any such change in control.
 
                                      21
<PAGE>
 
  The Milton Hershey School Trust has indicated to the Corporation that it
intends to maintain voting control of the Corporation and therefore it is
unlikely that the Severance Agreements would be utilized. The Milton Hershey
School Trust has also indicated that it, however, accepts the position of the
Corporation's Board of Directors that such arrangements are part of the usual
and ordinary compensation packages at major public companies and are important
to the Corporation's ability to attract and retain key employees.
 
Pension Plans
 
  Executive officers are eligible to receive pension benefits payable under
the Corporation's qualified defined benefit pension plan ("Pension Plan"), as
well as the nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides
benefits in excess of those that may be provided under plans (such as the
Pension Plan) that are subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.
The combined benefit paid to a participant pursuant to these plans is equal to
55% of that individual's final average compensation. Final average
compensation is determined by adding the participant's three years' average of
base salary and five years' average annual cash incentive award. The combined
amounts paid under the two plans are reduced by any applicable Social Security
benefits received, by a specified percentage for each month that retirement
occurs before age 60, and by a specified percentage for each year that
retirement occurs prior to the individual completing 15 years of service with
the Corporation.
 
  The final average compensation and the estimated credited years of service
as of December 31, 1998, respectively, for each of the named executive
officers are: K. L. Wolfe, $1,224,584, 29.8 years; J. P. Viviano, $936,405,
30.7 years; M. F. Pasquale, $538,762, 19.4 years; W. F. Christ, $482,672, 28.2
years; and J. F. Carr, $366,680, 24.8 years.
 
                               VOTING OF PROXIES
 
  A proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the meeting by
submitting to the Secretary of the Corporation a written notice revoking it,
by a duly-executed proxy bearing a later date, by a telephone vote cast at a
later date, or by voting by ballot at the meeting. Shares held for each
participant in the Corporation's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Service Plan
or the Corporation's Employee Savings Stock Investment and Ownership Plan
("ESSIOP") will be voted by the plan trustee as directed by the participant's
proxy. If an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Service Plan participant does not
return a proxy, the participant's shares in the plan will not be voted. If an
ESSIOP participant does not return a proxy, that participant's shares will be
voted by the plan trustee in the same proportion as the final aggregate votes
of plan participants actually voting on the matter.
 
                            SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
 
  The cost of preparing, assembling and mailing this proxy soliciting material
and Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be paid by the Corporation.
The Corporation has retained ChaseMellon Shareholder Services to assist in
soliciting proxies for a fee of $4,750 plus reimbursement of reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses. Additional solicitation by mail, telephone, telecopier or
by personal solicitation may be done by directors, officers and regular
employees of the Corporation, for which they will receive no additional
compensation. Brokerage houses and other nominees, fiduciaries and custodians
nominally holding shares of the Corporation's stock as of the record date will
be requested to forward proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owners of
such shares and will be reimbursed by the Corporation for their reasonable
expenses.

            SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
 
  The Corporation's executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders are
required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange reports of ownership
and changes in ownership in their holdings of the Corporation's stock. Copies
of these reports must also be furnished to the Corporation. Based on an
examination of these reports and on written representations provided to the
Corporation, all such reports have been timely filed, except that
inadvertently a report was not timely filed in connection with one disposition
of the Corporation's Common Stock by Mr. David W. Tacka, Corporate Controller
and Chief Accounting Officer.
 
                    CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS
 
  During 1998 the Corporation and its subsidiaries had a number of
transactions with the Milton Hershey School, with the Milton Hershey School
Trust, and with companies owned by the Milton Hershey School Trust, involving
the purchase or sale of goods and services. These latter transactions were
primarily with Hershey Entertainment & Resorts, an entertainment and resort
company based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and wholly-owned by the Milton Hershey
School Trust.
 
  The aggregate value of sales made during 1998 by the Corporation and its
subsidiaries to the Milton Hershey School, the Milton Hershey School Trust,
and companies owned by the Milton Hershey School Trust, amounted to
approximately $850,000. During the year, the Corporation purchased goods and
services from these entities in the amount of approximately $2,200,000. These
transactions were on terms that the Corporation believes to be no less
favorable to the Corporation than those which could have been obtained from
other purchasers or vendors.
 
                                OTHER BUSINESS
 
  It is not expected that any business other than that set forth in the Notice
of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and more specifically described in this
Proxy Statement will be brought before the meeting. However, if any other
business should properly come before the meeting, it is the intention of the
persons named on the enclosed proxy card to vote the signed proxies received
by them in accordance with their best judgment on such business and any
matters dealing with the conduct of the meeting.
 
                     STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS
 
  In accordance with the Corporation's By-Laws, stockholders (other than those
holding 25% of the outstanding votes entitled to be cast) who do not submit
proposals for inclusion in the Proxy Statement but who intend to present a
proposal, nomination for director or other business for consideration at any
meeting of stockholders, including any Annual Meeting, are required to notify
the Secretary of the Corporation of their proposal or nomination and provide
other information in advance of such meeting.
 
  The 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on April 25, 2000. To
be eligible for inclusion in the Corporation's Proxy Statement for the 2000
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholder proposals must be received by the
Corporation by November 15, 1999.
 
                                      23

  In accordance with the Corporation's By-Laws, stockholders (other than those
holding 25% of the outstanding votes entitled to be cast) who do not submit
proposals for inclusion in the Proxy Statement but who intend to present a
proposal, nomination for director or other business for consideration at any
meeting of stockholders, including any Annual Meeting, are required to notify
the Secretary of the Corporation of their proposal or nomination and provide
other information in advance of such meeting. Stockholders interested in
making proposals at the 2000 Annual Meeting should submit their name and
address, their shareholdings, a brief description of the proposal, and any
financial or other interest they have in such proposal to the Corporation no
later than February 25, 2000.
 
  In addition, the Corporation's By-Laws require that a stockholder wishing to
make a nomination for director at the 2000 Annual Meeting, who does not submit
the nomination for inclusion in the Proxy Statement for such meeting, must
submit the following information to the Corporation no later than February 25,
2000: name and address, a representation that the stockholder is a holder of
record and intends to attend such meeting, a description of any arrangement
between the stockholder and the individual planned to be nominated, the
nominee's name, address and biographical information, and the consent of the
nominee.
 
  All notices for stockholder proposals and director nominations should be
sent to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation at 100 Crystal A
Drive, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033-0810.
 
                      SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K
 
  The Corporation will provide without charge to each beneficial owner of its
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, upon such stockholder's request, a copy
(without exhibits) of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1998 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Requests for copies should be addressed to Hershey Foods
Corporation, Investor Relations Department, 100 Crystal A Drive, Hershey, PA
17033-0810.
 
  A copy of the Corporation's Summary Annual Report to Stockholders for the
year ended December 31, 1998 accompanies this Proxy Statement. Appendix A to
this Proxy Statement containing the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Management's Discussion and Analysis comprises a portion of that report. The
Summary Annual Report, the Appendix and the Annual Report on Form 10-K are not
part of the Corporation's proxy solicitation materials.
 
                                          By order of the Board of Directors,

  Stockholders who desire to have their stock voted at the meeting are
requested to either (1) mark, sign, and date the enclosed proxy card and
return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or (2) follow the
telephone voting instructions on the enclosed proxy card. Stockholders may
revoke their proxies at any time prior to the meeting and stockholders who are
present at the meeting may revoke their proxies and vote, if they so desire,

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
 
OPERATING RESULTS
 
  The Corporation achieved record sales and income levels in 1998, following a
record performance in 1997. Results over the two-year period reflected a
strategic acquisition and several divestitures, along with a significant
contribution from the introduction of new confectionery products and solid
growth from existing confectionery and grocery brands. Sales increases during
the period were offset somewhat by lower sales of pasta products, a higher
level of confectionery unsalables and the impact of currency exchange rates in
the Canadian and Mexican markets.
 
  Net sales during the two-year period increased at a compound annual rate of
5% and net income also increased at a compound annual rate of 5%, excluding
the loss on disposal of businesses in 1996. The increase in net income over
the period reflected the growth in sales, partially offset by lower gross
margin and higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses.
 
  The following acquisition and divestitures occurred during the period:
 
 . December 1996--The acquisition from an affiliate of Huhtamaki Oy
  (Huhtamaki), the international foods company based in Finland, of
  Huhtamaki's Leaf North America (Leaf) confectionery operations for $437.2
  million, plus the assumption of $17.0 million in debt. In addition, the
  parties entered into a trademark and technology license agreement under
  which the Corporation will manufacture and/or market and distribute in
  North, Central and South America Huhtamaki's confectionery brands including
  GOOD & PLENTY, HEATH, JOLLY RANCHER, MILK DUDS, PAYDAY and WHOPPERS.
 
 . December 1998--The announcement that the Corporation had signed a definitive
  agreement providing for the sale of a 94% majority interest of its U.S.
  pasta business to New World Pasta, LLC. The transaction was completed in
  January 1999 and included the AMERICAN BEAUTY, IDEAL BY SAN GIORGIO, LIGHT
  'N FLUFFY, MRS. WEISS, P&R, RONZONI, SAN GIORGIO and SKINNER pasta brands
  along with six manufacturing plants. In the first quarter of 1999, the
  Corporation received cash proceeds of $450.0 million, retained a 6% minority
  interest and recorded an after-tax gain of approximately $165.0 million or
  $1.13 per share--diluted as a result of the transaction.
 
 . December 1996--The sale to Huhtamaki of the outstanding shares of Gubor
  Holding GmbH (Gubor) and Sperlari S.r.l. (Sperlari). Gubor manufactures and
  markets high-quality assorted pralines and seasonal chocolate products in
  Germany, and Sperlari manufactures and markets various confectionery and
  grocery products in Italy. The sale resulted in an after-tax loss of $35.4
  million, since no tax benefit associated with the transaction was recorded.
  Combined net sales for Gubor and Sperlari were $216.6 million in 1996.
 
 . January 1996--The sale of the assets of Hershey Canada, Inc.'s PLANTERS nut
  (Planters) business to Johnvince Foods Group and the LIFE SAVERS and BREATH
  SAVERS hard candy and BEECH-NUT cough drops (Life Savers) business to Beta
  Brands Inc. Both transactions were part of a restructuring program announced
  by the Corporation in late 1994.
 
Net Sales
 
  Net sales rose $133.4 million or 3% in 1998 and $312.9 million in 1997, an
increase of 8%. The increase in 1998 was primarily a result of incremental
sales from the introduction of new confectionery products and increased sales
volume for existing confectionery and grocery products in North America. These
increases were offset somewhat by a decline in sales in the Corporation's
Asian and Russian markets and the impact of currency exchange rates in the
Canadian and Mexican markets, in addition to higher levels of confectionery
unsalables and lower sales of pasta products. The increase in
 
                                      A-1
<PAGE>
 
1997 was primarily due to incremental sales from the Leaf acquisition,
increased sales of existing confectionery items and the introduction of new
confectionery products. These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales
resulting from the divestiture of the Gubor and Sperlari businesses and a
decline in sales of pasta and grocery products.
 
Costs and Expenses
 
  Cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased from 57.7% in 1996 to
57.9% in 1997, and to 59.2% in 1998. The decrease in gross margin in 1998 was
principally the result of higher costs for certain major raw materials,
primarily milk and cocoa, labor and overhead, higher shipping and distribution
costs and the mix of non-chocolate and chocolate confectionery items sold in
1998 compared to 1997. These cost increases were partially offset by lower
costs for certain raw materials and improved manufacturing efficiencies,
including significant improvements in plants acquired with the Leaf business.
The decrease in gross margin in 1997 was primarily the result of the lower
margin associated with the Leaf business and higher costs associated with
certain new products and seasonal items, partially offset by lower costs for
certain major raw materials, primarily milk and semolina, and the favorable
impact of the Gubor and Sperlari divestitures.
 
  Selling, marketing and administrative costs decreased by 1% in 1998, as
reduced marketing expenses for existing brands, lower selling expenses in
international markets and lower administrative expenses were only partially
offset by higher marketing expenses associated with the introduction of new
products. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased by 5% in
1997, as a result of incremental expenses associated with the Leaf business
and increased marketing expenses related to the introduction of new products,
partially offset by decreases resulting from the Gubor and Sperlari
divestitures and reduced marketing spending for existing brands.
 
Interest Expense, Net
 
  Net interest expense in 1998 exceeded the prior year by $9.4 million,
primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with the purchase of
Common Stock from the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of
Milton Hershey School (Milton Hershey School Trust), partially offset by lower
interest expense reflecting reduced average short-term borrowings.
 
  Net interest expense in 1997 was $28.2 million above prior year, primarily
as a result of incremental borrowings associated with the Leaf acquisition and
the purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. Fixed
interest expense increased as a result of the issuance of $150 million of
6.95% Notes due 2007 in March 1997 and $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2012
and $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 in August 1997.
 
Provision for Income Taxes
 
  The Corporation's effective income tax rate was 43.1%, 39.3% and 38.8% in
1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. The rate decreased from 39.3% in 1997 to
38.8% in 1998 primarily due to changes in the mix of the Corporation's income
among various tax jurisdictions. The rate decreased in 1997 compared to 1996
primarily due to the lack of any tax benefit associated with the 1996 loss on
disposal of businesses and the lower 1997 effective state income tax rate.
 
Net Income
 
  Net income increased $4.6 million or 1% in 1998, following an increase of
$63.1 million or 23% in 1997. Excluding the loss on the disposal of the Gubor
and Sperlari businesses in 1996, 1997 income increased $27.7 million or 9%.
Net income as a percent of net sales was 7.7% in 1998, 7.8% in 1997 and 6.8%
in 1996. Income as a percent of net sales excluding the loss on the sale of
the Gubor and Sperlari businesses was 7.7% in 1996.

FINANCIAL POSITION
 
  The Corporation's financial position remained strong during 1998. The
capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a percent of
stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was 54% as of December
31, 1998, and 60% as of December 31, 1997. The higher capitalization ratio in
1997 primarily reflected the additional borrowings to finance the purchase of
Common Stock and the related decrease in stockholders' equity as a result of
the additional treasury stock. The ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was 1.4:1 as of December 31, 1998, and 1.3:1 as of December 31,
1997.
 
Assets
 
  Total assets increased $112.9 million or 3% as of December 31, 1998,
primarily as a result of increases in accounts receivable and other current
and non-current assets.
 
  Current assets increased by $99.2 million or 10% reflecting increased
accounts receivable and higher prepaid expenses and other current assets. The
increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of the timing and
payment terms associated with sales occurring toward the end of the year and
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was principally
associated with commodities transactions. These increases were offset somewhat
by lower deferred income taxes and reduced inventory levels.
 
  Property, plant and equipment was slightly lower than the prior year as
capital additions of $161.3 million were more than offset by depreciation
expense of $138.5 million and the retirement and translation of fixed assets
of $23.0 million. The increase in other non-current assets was primarily
associated with the capitalization of software.
 
Liabilities
 
  Total liabilities decreased by $76.6 million or 3% as of December 31, 1998,
primarily due to a decrease in debt and lower accrued liabilities, partially
offset by higher deferred income taxes. The increase in short-term debt of
$113.5 million reflected the reclassification of commercial paper borrowings
of $150.0 million which were classified as long-term debt as of December 31,
1997, partially offset by a reduction in short-term borrowings of $36.5
million in 1998. As of December 31, 1997, $150.0 million of commercial paper
borrowings were reclassified as long-term debt in accordance with the
Corporation's intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term
basis. A similar reclassification was not recorded as of December 31, 1998,
because the Corporation intends to reduce commercial paper borrowings during
1999. Accrued liabilities decreased by $77.1 million primarily reflecting
commodities transactions and reduced accruals for marketing programs and
integration costs related to the Leaf acquisition.
 
Stockholders' Equity
 
  Total stockholders' equity increased by 22% in 1998, as net income exceeded
dividends paid. Total stockholders' equity has increased at a compound annual
rate of less than 1% over the past ten years reflecting the $1.3 billion of
Common Stock repurchased since 1993.
 
Capital Structure
 
  The Corporation has two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock (Class B Stock). Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B
Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to
stockholders, including the election of directors, with the Common Stock
having one vote per share and the Class B Stock having ten votes per share.
However, the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is entitled to elect
one-sixth of the Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, the
Common Stock is entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and
paid on the Class B Stock.

LIQUIDITY
 
  Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. The Corporation's income and, consequently, cash
provided from operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales
patterns, the timing of new product introductions, business acquisitions and
divestitures, and price increases. Chocolate, confectionery and grocery
seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the
third and fourth quarters of the year, representing the principal seasonal
effect. Generally, seasonal working capital needs peak during the summer
months and have been met by issuing commercial paper.
 
  Over the past three years, cash requirements for share repurchases, capital
expenditures, capitalized software additions, business acquisitions and
dividend payments exceeded cash provided from operating activities and
proceeds from business divestitures by $449.5 million. Total debt, including
debt assumed, increased during the period by $454.4 million. Cash and cash
equivalents increased by $6.7 million during the period.
 
  The Corporation anticipates that capital expenditures will be in the range
of $150 million to $170 million per annum during the next several years as a
result of continued modernization of existing facilities and capacity
expansion to support new products and line extensions. As of December 31,
1998, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included manufacturing
capacity expansion and modernization.
 
  In August 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
split of the Common Stock and Class B Common Stock effective September 13,
1996, to stockholders of record August 23, 1996. The split was effected as a
stock dividend by distributing one additional share for each share held.
Unless otherwise indicated, all shares and per share information have been
restated to reflect the stock split.
 
  Under share repurchase programs which began in 1993, a total of 9,861,119
shares of Common Stock have been repurchased for approximately $287.5 million.
Of the shares repurchased, 528,000 shares were retired, 529,498 shares were
reissued to satisfy stock options obligations and the remaining 8,803,621
shares were held as Treasury Stock as of December 31, 1998. Additionally, the
Corporation has purchased a total of 28,000,536 shares of its Common Stock to
be held as Treasury Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust for $1.0
billion. As of December 31, 1998, a total of 36,804,157 shares were held as
Treasury Stock and $112.5 million remained available for repurchases of Common
Stock under a program approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors in
February 1996. In February 1999, the Corporation purchased approximately 2.0
million shares, completing the 1996 repurchase program. Also in February, the
Corporation's Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase
program authorizing the repurchase of up to $230 million of the Corporation's
Common Stock of which $100.0 million was used to purchase approximately 1.6
million shares of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust.
 
  In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2007
under a Form S-3 Registration Statement which was declared effective in
November 1993. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of
the commercial paper borrowings associated with the Leaf acquisition.
 
  In August 1997, the Corporation filed another Form S-3 Registration
Statement under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to
$500 million of additional debt securities. Also in August 1997, the
Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2012 and $250 million of
7.2% Debentures due 2027 under the November 1993 and August 1997 Registration
Statements. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of
the short-term borrowings associated with the purchase of Common Stock from
the Milton Hershey School Trust. As of December 31, 1998, $250 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration
 
                                      A-4
<PAGE>
 
Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250 million of debt securities
available under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate
requirements which include reducing existing commercial paper borrowings,
financing capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.
 
  In December 1995, the Corporation entered into committed credit facility
agreements with a syndicate of banks under which it could borrow up to $600
million with options to increase borrowings by $1.0 billion with the
concurrence of the banks. Lines of credit previously maintained by the
Corporation were significantly reduced when the credit facility agreements
became effective. Of the total committed credit facility, $200 million was for
a renewable 364-day term and $400 million was effective for a five-year term.
In December 1998, the short-term credit facility agreement was renewed for a
total of $177 million. The long-term committed credit facility agreement was
amended and renewed in December 1997 and will expire in December 2002. The
credit facilities may be used to fund general corporate requirements, to
support commercial paper borrowings and, in certain instances, to finance
future business acquisitions. The Corporation also had lines of credit with
domestic and international commercial banks of $23.0 million and $20.7 million
as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
 
Cash Flow Activities
 
  Cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.4 billion during the past
three years. Over this period, cash used by or provided from accounts
receivable and inventories has tended to fluctuate as a result of sales during
December and inventory management practices. The change in cash required for
or provided from other assets and liabilities between the years was primarily
related to commodities transactions, the timing of payments for accrued
liabilities, including income taxes, and variations in the funding status of
pension plans.
 
  Investing activities included capital additions and business acquisitions
and divestitures. Capital additions during the past three years included the
purchase of manufacturing equipment, and expansion and modernization of
existing facilities. In 1996, the Leaf business was acquired, and the Gubor,
Sperlari, Planters and Life Savers businesses were sold. Cash used for the
Leaf acquisition represented the purchase price paid and consisted of the
current assets, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other assets
acquired, net of liabilities assumed.
 
  Financing activities included debt borrowings and repayments, payment of
dividends, the exercise of stock options, incentive plan transactions and the
repurchase of Common Stock. During the past three years, short-term borrowings
in the form of commercial paper or bank borrowings were used to fund seasonal
working capital requirements, business acquisitions, share repurchase programs
and purchases of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. The
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were used to reduce short-term
borrowings. During the past three years, a total of 11,909,849 shares of
Common Stock has been repurchased for $589.9 million. Cash requirements for
incentive plan transactions were $103.2 million during the past three years,
partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options of $55.8
million.
 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
 
  The Corporation utilizes certain derivative instruments, including interest
rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and commodity futures
and options contracts, to manage interest rate, currency exchange rate and
commodity market price risk exposures. The interest rate swaps and foreign
currency contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related
underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those
exposures. Commodity futures and options contracts are entered into for
varying periods and are intended and effective as hedges of anticipated
 
                                      A-5
<PAGE>
 
raw material purchases. The Corporation does not hold or issue derivative
instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with
leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, the
Corporation has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability
of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Corporation does
not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.
 
  The information below summarizes the Corporation's market risks associated
with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31,
1998. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Note 5, Note
7, and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Long-Term Debt
 
  The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates
by maturity date for long-term debt as of December 31, 1998. The fair value of
long-term debt was determined based upon quoted market prices for the same or
similar debt issues.

</TABLE>
 
Interest Rate Swaps
 
  In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap
agreements to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate debt,
principally commercial paper borrowings or bank loans with an original
maturity of three months or less, to fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 1998
and 1997, the Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate
notional amount of $75.0 million and $150.0 million with maturities through
September 1999 and September 1998, respectively. As of December 31, 1998 and
1997, interest rates payable were at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.3%. As
of December 31, 1998 and 1997, interest rates receivable of 5.2% and 5.7%,
respectively, were based on 30-day commercial paper composite rates. Any
interest rate differential on interest rate swaps is recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the term of each agreement. The
Corporation's risk related to swap agreements is limited to the cost of
replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates. The potential loss in
fair value of interest rate swaps resulting from a hypothetical near-term
adverse change in market rates of ten percent was not material as of December
31, 1998 and 1997.
 
Foreign Exchange Contracts
 
  The Corporation enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge
transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase equipment,
certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies,
and to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-domestic
subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate
movements.
 
  Foreign exchange forward contracts are intended and effective as hedges of
firm, identifiable, foreign currency commitments. In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 "Foreign Currency Translation," these
contracts meet the conditions for hedge accounting treatment and accordingly,
gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying
transactions. Gains and losses on terminated derivatives designated as hedges
are accounted for as part of the originally hedged transaction. Gains and
losses on derivatives designated as hedges of items which mature, are sold or
terminated, are recorded currently in income.
 
                                      A-6
<PAGE>
 
  As of December 31, 1998, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 1999 and 2000 to purchase $10.5 million in foreign
currency, primarily British sterling and Dutch gilders, and to sell $9.6
million in Japanese yen at contracted forward rates.
 
  As of December 31, 1997, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 1998 and 1999 to purchase $19.2 million in foreign
currency, primarily British sterling, and to sell $16.7 million in foreign
currency, primarily Japanese yen and Canadian dollars, at contracted forward
rates.
 
  The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was estimated by
obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
necessary for maturity differences. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the fair
value of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated the contract value.
The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts
resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of ten
percent was not material as of December 31, 1998 and 1997.
 
Foreign Exchange Options
 
  To hedge foreign currency exposure related to anticipated transactions
associated with the purchase of certain raw materials and finished goods
generally covering 3 to 24 months, the Corporation, from time to time, also
purchases foreign exchange options which permit, but do not require, the
Corporation to exchange foreign currencies at a future date with another party
at a contracted exchange rate. Foreign exchange options are intended and
effective as hedges of anticipated transactions. Accordingly, gains and losses
are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying transactions. Gains
and losses on options designated as hedges of anticipated transactions which
are no longer likely to occur are recorded currently in income.
 
  As of December 31, 1998, no foreign exchange options were outstanding. As of
December 31, 1997, the Corporation had purchased foreign exchange options of
$3.6 million maturing in 1998, related to Swiss francs. The fair value of
foreign exchange options is estimated using active market quotations. As of
December 31, 1997, the fair value of foreign exchange options approximated the
contract value. The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange options
contracts resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market
rates of ten percent was not material as of December 31, 1997.
 
Commodity Price Risk Management
 
  The Corporation's most significant raw materials include cocoa, sugar, milk,
peanuts and almonds. The Corporation attempts to minimize the effect of future
price fluctuations related to the purchase of these raw materials primarily
through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements,
generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn
sweeteners, natural gas and certain dairy products, price risks are also
managed by entering into futures and options contracts. At the present time,
active futures and options contracts are not available for use in pricing the
Corporation's other major raw materials. Futures contracts are used in
combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener, natural
gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of
market fluctuations which provide more favorable pricing opportunities and to
increase diversity or flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy
requirements. The Corporation's commodity procurement practices are intended
to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially limit
the ability to benefit from possible price decreases.
 
  The cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity futures
contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to
a variety of factors, including the effect of weather on crop yield, other
imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates and speculative
influences. Cocoa prices have risen since 1992 due to demand exceeding
production. Recently, prices have declined somewhat as the economic
difficulties in eastern Europe, particularly
 
                                      A-7
<PAGE>
 
Russia and Southeast Asia, have negatively impacted demand. During 1999, these
negative demand influences could continue to keep cocoa futures prices
contained. The Corporation's costs during 1999 will not necessarily reflect
market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices,
premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times,
and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans.
 
Commodities Futures and Options Contracts
 
  In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural
gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements, the
Corporation enters into commodities futures and options contracts as deemed
appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 80 "Accounting for Futures
Contracts," these futures and options contracts meet the hedge criteria and
are accounted for as hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses are deferred and
recognized in cost of sales as part of the product cost. Gains and losses on
futures and options designated as hedges of anticipated purchases which are no
longer likely to occur are recorded currently in income.
 
  Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical
forward purchase contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of
futures contracts are made on a daily basis and are included in other current
assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Such cash
transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of
invoice prices of raw materials and energy requirements in the future. Futures
being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced
physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases.
 
  The following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the
Corporation to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent,
based on the Corporation's net commodity positions at four dates spaced
equally throughout the year. The Corporation's net commodity positions consist
of the excess of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward
contracts for the same commodities, relating to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners
and natural gas. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated
anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the
sensitivity analysis calculations. A loss is defined, for purposes of
determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the
opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The
fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or
estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with
the future delivery period.

RETURN MEASURES
 
Operating Return on Average Stockholders' Equity
 
  The Corporation's operating return on average stockholders' equity was 36.0%
in 1998. Over the most recent five-year period, the return has ranged from
18.5% in 1994 to 36.0% in 1998. For the purpose of calculating operating
return on average stockholders' equity, earnings is defined as net income,
excluding the after-tax restructuring activities in 1994 and 1995, and the
after-tax loss on the disposal of businesses in 1996.

Operating Return on Average Invested Capital
 
  The Corporation's operating return on average invested capital was 17.4% in
1998. Over the most recent five-year period, the return has ranged from 15.6%
in 1994 to 17.8% in 1996. Average invested capital consists of the annual
average of beginning and ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income
taxes and stockholders' equity. For the purpose of calculating operating
return on average invested capital, earnings is defined as net income,
excluding the after-tax restructuring activities in 1994 and 1995, the after-
tax loss on disposal of businesses in 1996, and the after-tax effect of
interest on long-term debt.
 
YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
  Year 2000 issues associated with information systems relate to the way dates
are recorded and computed in many computer systems. These year 2000 issues
could have an impact upon the Corporation's information technology (IT) and
non-IT systems. Non-IT systems include embedded technology such as
microcontrollers which are integral to the operation of most machinery and
equipment. Additionally, year 2000 issues could have a similar impact on the
Corporation's major business partners, including both customers and suppliers.
While it is not currently possible to estimate the total impact of a failure
of either the Corporation or its major business partners or suppliers to
complete their year 2000 remediation in a timely manner, the Corporation has
determined that it could suffer significant adverse financial consequences as
a result of such failure.
 
  Awareness and assessment of year 2000 issues regarding major business
applications software and other significant IT systems began in 1990. A formal
program to address year 2000 issues associated with IT systems was established
in late 1995. In early 1998, a team was established with representatives from
all major functional areas of the Corporation which assumed overall
responsibility for ensuring that remediation of both IT and non-IT systems
will be completed in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the
Corporation's business, operations or financial condition. The Corporation
expects that remediation of these systems will be essentially completed by the
third quarter of 1999.
 
  In late 1996, the Corporation approved a project to implement an enterprise-
wide integrated information system to improve process efficiencies in all of
the major functional areas of the Corporation, enabling the Corporation to
provide better service to its customers. This system will replace most of the
transaction systems and applications supporting operations of the Corporation.
In addition to improving efficiency and customer service, another benefit of
this system is that it is year 2000 compliant and will address year 2000
issues for approximately 80% of the Corporation's business applications
software. As of December 31, 1998, approximately $62.1 million of capitalized
software and hardware and $6.9 million of expenses have been incurred for this
project. As of December 31, 1998, spending for implementation of this system
was approximately 65% complete, with full implementation expected by the third
quarter of 1999. Total commitments for this system and subsequently identified
enhancements are expected to be approximately $110 million which will be
financed with cash provided from operations and short-term borrowings.
 
  The Corporation's mainframe, network and desktop hardware and software have
recently been upgraded and are substantially year 2000 compliant. The
Corporation is in the process of remediating year 2000 compliance issues
associated with legacy information systems not being replaced by the
integrated information system project, including process automation and
factory management systems. During late 1998, the Corporation undertook an
extensive review of its year 2000 remediation program. As a result of this
review, the Corporation has undertaken additional testing to confirm its year
2000 compliance, but is otherwise maintaining its current program of
remediation. As of December 31, 1998, remediation of both IT and non-IT
systems was approximately 60% complete, reflecting the latest estimate of
testing and work requirements to be performed. The total cost of remediation
of IT and non-IT systems is expected to be in the range of $6.0 million to
$8.0 million.
 
                                     A-10
<PAGE>
 
  The Corporation is also in the process of assessing year 2000 remediation
issues relating to its major business partners. All of the Corporation's major
customers have been contacted regarding year 2000 issues related to electronic
data interchange. The Corporation is also in the process of contacting its
major suppliers of ingredients, packaging, facilities, logistics and financial
services with regard to year 2000 issues. Because of the uncertainties
associated with assessing the ability of major business partners to complete
the remediation of their systems in time to prevent operational difficulties,
the Corporation will continue to contact and/or visit major customers and
suppliers to gain assurances that no significant adverse consequences will
result due to their failure to complete remediation of their systems.
 
  Year 2000 remediation, conversion, validation and implementation is
continuing and, at the present time, it is expected that remediation to both
the Corporation's IT and non-IT systems and those of major business partners
will be completed in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the
Corporation's business, operations or financial condition. However,
contingency plans are being developed, including possible increases in raw
material and finished goods inventory levels, and the identification of
alternate vendors and suppliers. Additional contingency plans, to the extent
feasible, will be developed for any potential failures resulting from year
2000 issues.
 
FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION
 
  The nature of the Corporation's operations and the environment in which it
operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In connection with the
"safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, the Corporation notes the following factors which, among others, could
cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements,
expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Many of the forward-
looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of
forward-looking words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "should,"
"planned," "estimated," and "potential" among others. Factors which could
cause results to differ include, but are not limited to: changes in the
confectionery and grocery business environment, including actions of
competitors and changes in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws
and regulations, including income taxes; market demand for new and existing
products; and raw material pricing.
 
  Based upon preliminary information, potential financial results for the
first quarter of 1999 may not compare favorably to the prior year's first
quarter. Net sales are expected to be lower than in the prior year primarily
reflecting the divestiture of the Corporation's pasta business in January
1999. Additionally, the timing of sales for seasonal and promoted items may
result in lower confectionery and grocery sales compared to the first quarter
of 1998. The divestiture of the Corporation's pasta business, higher
amortization of capitalized software associated with the enterprise-wide
integrated information system and an emphasis on expanding the distribution of
the Corporation's products in new international markets will make the earnings
comparison more difficult, considering a very strong first quarter of 1998.

                           HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION
 
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  Significant accounting policies employed by the Corporation are discussed
below and in other notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the 1998
presentation. Unless otherwise indicated, all shares and per share information
have been restated for the two-for-one stock split effective September 13,
1996.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts
and transactions.
 
Use of Estimates
 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates,
particularly for accounts receivable and certain current and long-term
liabilities.
 
Cash Equivalents
 
  All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents.
 
Commodities Futures and Options Contracts
 
  In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural
gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements, the
Corporation enters into commodities futures and options contracts as deemed
appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 80 "Accounting for Futures
Contracts," these futures and options contracts meet the hedge criteria and
are accounted for as hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses are deferred and
recognized in cost of sales as part of the product cost.
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of buildings,
machinery and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives.
 
Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions
 
  Intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions principally consist
of the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets of
businesses acquired (goodwill). Goodwill was $508.0 million and $527.6 million
as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years. Other intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The Corporation
periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred
indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. When
factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment,
the Corporation uses an estimate of the acquired business' undiscounted future
cash flows compared to the related carrying amount of net assets, including
goodwill, to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized.
 
                                     A-16
<PAGE>
 
  Accumulated amortization of intangible assets resulting from business
acquisitions was $132.3 million and $116.5 million as of December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively.
 
Comprehensive Income
 
  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income (SFAS
No. 130). SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components. SFAS No. 130 requires that an
enterprise (a) classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in
a financial statement and (b) display the accumulated balance of other
comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in
capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position. SFAS No.
130 is effective for the Corporation's 1998 financial statements.
 
  Results of operations for foreign entities are translated using the average
exchange rates during the period. For foreign entities, assets and liabilities
are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss), "Foreign Currency Translation
Adjustments."
 
  A minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the actuarial
present value of accumulated pension plan benefits exceeds plan assets and
accrued pension liabilities, less allowable intangible assets. Minimum pension
liability adjustments, net of income taxes, are recorded as a component of
other comprehensive income (loss), "Minimum Pension Liability Adjustments."
 
  Comprehensive income (loss) is reported on the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders' Equity and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) is reported on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
Foreign Exchange Contracts
 
  The Corporation enters into foreign exchange forward and options contracts
to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase
equipment, certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign
currencies, and to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-
domestic subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate
movements.
 
  Foreign exchange forward contracts are intended and effective as hedges of
firm, identifiable, foreign currency commitments and foreign exchange options
contracts meet required hedge criteria for anticipated transactions.
Accordingly, gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the
underlying transactions. Gains and losses on terminated derivatives designated
as hedges are accounted for as part of the originally hedged transaction.
Gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges of items which mature,
are sold or terminated, or of anticipated transactions which are no longer
likely to occur, are recorded currently in income. In entering into these
contracts the Corporation has assumed the risk which might arise from the
possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
Corporation does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.
 
License Agreements
 
  The Corporation has entered into license agreements under which it has
access to certain trademarks and proprietary technology, and manufactures
and/or markets and distributes certain products. The rights under these
agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporation's option
subject to certain conditions, including minimum sales levels, which the
Corporation has met. License fees and royalties, payable under the terms of
the agreements, are expensed as incurred.
 
                                     A-17
<PAGE>
 
Research and Development
 
  The Corporation expenses research and development costs as incurred.
Research and development expense was $28.6 million, $27.5 million and $26.1
million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 
Advertising
 
  The Corporation expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense
was $187.5 million, $202.4 million and $174.2 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Prepaid advertising as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, was $12.1
million and $2.0 million, respectively.
 
Computer Software
 
  In 1997, the Corporation began capitalizing certain costs of computer
software developed or obtained for internal use. The amount capitalized as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, was $69.3 million and $29.1 million, respectively.
If such costs were capitalized in prior years, the effect would not have been
material. Software assets are classified as other non-current assets and are
amortized over periods up to five years. Accumulated amortization of
capitalized software was $2.8 million and $.2 million as of December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively.
 
2. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES
 
  In December 1996, the Corporation acquired from an affiliate of Huhtamaki Oy
(Huhtamaki), the international foods company based in Finland, Huhtamaki's
Leaf North America (Leaf) confectionery operations for $437.2 million, plus
the assumption of $17.0 million in debt. In addition, the parties entered into
a trademark and technology license agreement under which the Corporation will
manufacture and/or market and distribute in North, Central and South America
Huhtamaki's confectionery brands including GOOD & PLENTY, HEATH, JOLLY
RANCHER, MILK DUDS, PAYDAY and WHOPPERS. Leaf's principal manufacturing
facilities are located in Denver, Colorado; Memphis, Tennessee; and Robinson,
Illinois.
 
  In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price of
the Leaf acquisition was allocated on a preliminary basis to the underlying
assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition based on their estimated
respective fair values, which were revised and finalized by the anniversary
date of the acquisition. Total liabilities assumed, including debt, were
$138.0 million in 1996. Results subsequent to the date of the acquisition are
included in the consolidated financial statements.
 
  Had the acquisition of Leaf occurred at the beginning of 1996, pro forma
consolidated results would have been as follows:

     Net sales                                         $4,473,950

     Net income per share--Diluted                           1.50
</TABLE>
 
  The pro forma results are based on historical financial information provided
by Huhtamaki, including a business restructuring charge recorded by Huhtamaki
in 1996, and adjusted to give effect to certain costs and expenses, including
fees under the trademark and technology license agreement, goodwill
amortization, interest expense and income taxes which would have been incurred
by the Corporation if it had owned and operated the Leaf confectionery
business throughout 1996. These

<PAGE>
 
results are not necessarily reflective of the actual results which would have
occurred if the acquisition had been completed at the beginning of the year,
nor are they necessarily indicative of future combined financial results.
 
  In December 1998, the Corporation announced that it had signed a definitive
agreement providing for the sale of a 94% majority interest of its U.S. pasta
business to New World Pasta, LLC. The transaction was completed in January
1999, and included the AMERICAN BEAUTY, IDEAL BY SAN GIORGIO, LIGHT 'N FLUFFY,
MRS. WEISS, P&R, RONZONI, SAN GIORGIO and SKINNER pasta brands, along with six
manufacturing plants. In the first quarter of 1999, the Corporation received
cash proceeds of $450.0 million, retained a 6% minority interest and recorded
an after-tax gain of approximately $165.0 million or $1.13 per share--diluted
as a result of the transaction. Net sales for the pasta business were $373.1
million, $386.2 million and $407.4 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Net income for the pasta business was $25.9 million, $25.2
million and $18.7 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 
  In December 1996, the Corporation completed the sale to Huhtamaki of the
outstanding shares of Gubor Holding GmbH (Gubor) and Sperlari S.r.l.
(Sperlari). Gubor manufactures and markets high-quality assorted pralines and
seasonal chocolate products in Germany and Sperlari manufactures and markets
various confectionery and grocery products in Italy. The total proceeds from
the sale of the Gubor and Sperlari businesses were $121.7 million. The
transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $35.4 million since no tax
benefit associated with the transaction was recorded. Combined net sales for
Gubor and Sperlari were $216.6 million in 1996. The sale of Gubor and Sperlari
allowed the Corporation to place additional focus on its North American
markets and improve financial returns.
 
  In January 1996, the Corporation completed the sale of the assets of Hershey
Canada, Inc.'s PLANTERS nut (Planters) business to Johnvince Foods Group and
the LIFE SAVERS and BREATH SAVERS hard candy and BEECH-NUT cough drops (Life
Savers) business to Beta Brands Inc. Both transactions were part of a
restructuring program announced by the Corporation in late 1994.
 
3. RENTAL AND LEASE COMMITMENTS
 
  Rent expense was $39.6 million, $31.8 million and $25.3 million for 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively. Rent expense pertains to all operating leases,
which were principally related to certain administrative buildings,
distribution facilities and transportation equipment. Future minimum rental
payments under non-cancelable operating leases with a remaining term in excess
of one year as of December 31, 1998, were: 1999, $13.3 million; 2000, $13.0
million; 2001, $12.7 million; 2002, $12.2 million; 2003, $9.3 million; 2004
and beyond, $46.8 million.
 
4. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
 
  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.
SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and
losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement,
and requires that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.
 
  SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999,
but may be implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after
issuance. Retroactive application is not permitted. SFAS No. 133 must be
applied to (a) derivative instruments and (b) certain derivative instruments
embedded
 
                                     A-19
<PAGE>
 
in hybrid contracts that were issued, acquired, or substantively modified
after December 31, 1997. Changes in accounting methods will be required for
derivative instruments utilized by the Corporation to hedge commodity price,
foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks. Such derivatives
include commodity futures and options contracts, foreign exchange forward and
options contracts and interest rate swaps.
 
  The Corporation anticipates the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January 1,
2000. As of December 31, 1998, net deferred losses on derivatives of
approximately $16.5 million after tax would have been reported as a component
of other comprehensive loss and classified as accumulated other comprehensive
loss on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption of SFAS No. 133.
 
5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
  The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
approximated fair value as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, because of the
relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-
term debt, including the current portion, was $879.2 million as of December
31, 1998, compared to a fair value of $1.0 billion based on quoted market
prices for the same or similar debt issues. The carrying value of long-term
debt, including the current portion, was $904.2 million as of December 31,
1997, compared to a fair value of $961.0 million.
 
  As of December 31, 1998, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 1999 and 2000 to purchase $10.5 million in foreign
currency, primarily British sterling and Dutch gilders, and to sell $9.6
million in Japanese yen at contracted forward rates.
 
  As of December 31, 1997, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 1998 and 1999 to purchase $19.2 million in foreign
currency, primarily British sterling, and to sell $16.7 million in foreign
currency, primarily Japanese yen and Canadian dollars, at contracted forward
rates.
 
  To hedge foreign currency exposure related to anticipated transactions
associated with the purchase of certain raw materials and finished goods
generally covering 3 to 24 months, the Corporation, from time to time, also
purchases foreign exchange options which permit, but do not require, the
Corporation to exchange foreign currencies at a future date with another party
at a contracted exchange rate. No options were outstanding as of December 31,
1998. As of December 31, 1997, the Corporation had purchased foreign exchange
options of $3.6 million, related to Swiss francs.
 
  The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
necessary for maturity differences, and the fair value of foreign exchange
options is estimated using active market quotations. As of December 31, 1998
and 1997, the fair value of foreign exchange forward and options contracts
approximated the contract value. The Corporation does not hold or issue
financial instruments for trading purposes.
 
  In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap
agreements to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate debt to fixed
rate debt. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Corporation had agreements
outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $75.0 million and $150.0
million with maturities through September 1999 and September 1998,
respectively. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, interest rates payable were at
a weighted average fixed rate of 6.3%. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997,
interest rates receivable of 5.2% and 5.7%, respectively, were based on 30-day
commercial paper composite rates. Any interest rate differential on interest
rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of
each agreement. The Corporation's risk related to swap agreements is limited
to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates.

</TABLE>
 
7. SHORT-TERM DEBT
 
  Generally, the Corporation's short-term borrowings are in the form of
commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or
less. In December 1995, the Corporation entered into committed credit facility
agreements with a syndicate of banks under which it could borrow up to $600
million, with options to increase borrowings by $1.0 billion with the
concurrence of the banks. Of the total committed credit facility, $200 million
was for a renewable 364-day term and $400 million was effective for a five-
year term. In December 1998, the short-term credit facility agreement was
renewed for a total of $177 million. The long-term credit facility agreement
was amended and renewed in December 1997 and will expire in December 2002. The
credit facilities may be used to fund general corporate requirements, to
support commercial paper borrowings and, in certain instances, to finance
future business acquisitions. As of December 31, 1997, $150.0 million of
commercial paper borrowings were reclassified as long-term debt in accordance
with the Corporation's intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a
long-term basis. A similar reclassification was not recorded as of December
31, 1998, because the Corporation intends to reduce commercial paper
borrowings during 1999.
 
  The Corporation also maintains lines of credit arrangements with domestic
and international commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various
currencies up to approximately $23.0 million and $20.7 million as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, at the lending banks' prime commercial
interest rates or lower. The Corporation had combined domestic commercial
paper borrowings, including the portion classified as long-term debt as of
December 31, 1997, and short-term foreign bank loans against its credit
facilities and lines of credit of $345.9 million as of December 31, 1998, and
$382.5 million as of December 31, 1997. The weighted average interest rates on
short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, were 5.2%
and 5.7%, respectively.
 
  The credit facilities and lines of credit were supported by commitment fee
arrangements. The average fee during 1998 was less than .1% per annum of the
commitment. The Corporation's credit facility agreements contain a financial
covenant which requires that a specified interest and fixed charge ratio be
maintained. These agreements are also subject to other representations and
covenants which do not materially restrict the Corporation's activities. The
Corporation is in compliance with all covenants included in the credit
facility agreements. There were no significant compensating balance agreements
which legally restricted these funds.
 
  As a result of maintaining a consolidated cash management system, the
Corporation maintains overdraft positions at certain banks. Such overdrafts,
which were included in accounts payable, were $57.0 million and $30.7 million
as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

  As of December 31, 1997, $150.0 million of commercial paper borrowings were
reclassified as long-term debt. A similar reclassification was not recorded as
of December 31, 1998, because the Corporation intends to reduce commercial
paper borrowings during 1999.
 
  In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2007
under the November 1993 Form S-3 Registration Statement. Proceeds from the
debt issuance were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings
associated with the Leaf acquisition.
 
  In August 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2012
and $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration Statements. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used
to repay a portion of the short-term borrowings associated with the purchase
of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust.
 
  Aggregate annual maturities during the next five years are: 1999, $.1
million; 2000, $2.2 million; 2001, $.2 million; 2002, $.2 million; and 2003,
$17.1 million. The Corporation's debt is principally unsecured and of equal
priority. None of the debt is convertible into stock of the Corporation. The
Corporation is in compliance with all covenants included in the related debt
agreements.

  In January 1999, the Corporation received a Notice of Proposed Deficiency
(Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to the years 1989
through 1996. The most significant issue pertains to the Corporate Owned Life
Insurance (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The
IRS proposed the disallowance of interest expense deductions associated with
the underlying life insurance policies. The Corporation believes that it has
fully complied with the tax law as it relates to its COLI program. The
Corporation expects to file a protest of the proposed deficiency with the
Appeals section of the IRS in early 1999 and intends to vigorously defend its
position on this matter.
 
10. PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
 
  The Corporation's policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in
accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Federal income tax laws,
respectively. Non-domestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with
applicable local laws and regulations. Plan assets are invested in a broadly
diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international
common stocks and fixed income securities. Other benefits include health care
and life insurance provided by the Corporation under two post-retirement
benefit plans.

  Effective December 31, 1998, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pension and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits (SFAS No. 132). The provisions of SFAS No. 132 revise
employers' disclosures about pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
It does not change the measurement or recognition of these plans.

December 31, 1998 and 1997 is presented below:

  The Corporation has two post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan
is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually, and the
life insurance plan is non-contributory. Effective December 1998, for all
eligible employees under age 45, the Corporation will provide annual
contributions into the Employee Savings Stock Investment and Ownership Plan
(ESSIOP) instead of providing coverage under the current retiree medical plan.
This change resulted in the immediate recognition of a $13.0 million pre-tax
gain which is not included above as a component of net periodic benefits cost.
The changes apply to all U.S. full-time salaried employees, and all non-union
hourly plant employees working outside of Hershey, PA.
 
  Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point change in
assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

  A minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the actuarial
present value of accumulated plan benefits exceeds plan assets and accrued
pension liabilities. In 1998, a minimum liability adjustment of $4.1 million,
less allowable intangible assets, net of a deferred tax benefit of $2.7
million, was recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss and reported
in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders'
equity.
 
11. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP TRUST
 
  The Corporation's employee stock ownership trust (ESOP) serves as the
primary vehicle for contributions to its existing ESSIOP for participating
domestic salaried and hourly employees. The ESOP was funded by a 15-year 7.75%
loan of $47.9 million from the Corporation. During 1998 and 1997,
 
                                     A-25
<PAGE>
 
the ESOP received a combination of dividends on unallocated shares and
contributions from the Corporation equal to the amount required to meet its
principal and interest payments under the loan. Simultaneously, the ESOP
allocated to participants 159,176 shares of Common Stock each year. As of
December 31, 1998, the ESOP held 927,863 allocated shares and 1,273,400
unallocated shares. All ESOP shares are considered outstanding for income per
share computations.
 
  The Corporation recognized net compensation expense equal to the shares
allocated multiplied by the original cost of $20 1/16 per share less dividends
received by the ESOP on unallocated shares. Compensation expense related to
the ESOP for 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $1.0 million, $1.4 million and $1.8
million, respectively. Dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares were $1.2
million in 1998 and $1.3 million in 1997 and 1996. The unearned ESOP
compensation balance in stockholders' equity represented deferred compensation
expense to be recognized by the Corporation in future years as additional
shares are allocated to participants.
 
12. CAPITAL STOCK AND NET INCOME PER SHARE
 
  As of December 31, 1998, the Corporation had 530,000,000 authorized shares
of capital stock. Of this total, 450,000,000 shares were designated as Common
Stock, 75,000,000 shares as Class B Common Stock (Class B Stock), and
5,000,000 shares as Preferred Stock, each class having a par value of one
dollar per share. As of December 31, 1998, a combined total of 179,950,872
shares of both classes of common stock had been issued of which 143,146,715
shares were outstanding. No shares of the Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding during the three-year period ended December 31, 1998.
 
  In August 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
split of the Common Stock and Class B Common Stock effective September 13,
1996, to stockholders of record August 23, 1996. The split was effected as a
stock dividend by distributing one additional share for each share held.
 
  Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together
without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the
election of directors, with the Common Stock having one vote per share and the
Class B Stock having ten votes per share. However, the Common Stock, voting
separately as a class, is entitled to elect one-sixth of the Board of
Directors. With respect to dividend rights, the Common Stock is entitled to
cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock.
 
  Class B Stock can be converted into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis
at any time. During 1998, 1997 and 1996, a total of 18,000 shares, 13,000
shares and 2,000 shares, respectively, of Class B Stock were converted into
Common Stock.
 
  Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School
(Milton Hershey School Trust), as institutional fiduciary for estates and
trusts unrelated to Milton Hershey School, and as direct owner of investment
shares, held a total of 14,531,294 shares of the Common Stock, and as Trustee
for the benefit of Milton Hershey School, held 30,306,006 shares of the Class
B Stock as of December 31, 1998, and was entitled to cast approximately 76% of
the total votes of both classes of the Corporation's common stock. The Milton
Hershey School Trust must approve the issuance of shares of Common Stock or
any other action which would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust not
continuing to have voting control of the Corporation.
 
  A total of 9,861,119 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased for
approximately $287.5 million under share repurchase programs which were
approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors in 1993 and 1996. Of the
shares repurchased, 528,000 shares were retired, 529,498 shares were reissued
to satisfy stock options obligations and the remaining 8,803,621 shares were
held as Treasury Stock as of December 31, 1998. In August 1997, the
Corporation purchased an additional
 
                                     A-26
<PAGE>
 
9,900,990 shares of its Common Stock to be held as Treasury Stock from the
Milton Hershey School Trust for $500.0 million. This was in addition to the
18,099,546 shares purchased from the Milton Hershey School Trust in August
1995 for $500.0 million. A total of 36,804,157 shares were held as Treasury
Stock as of December 31, 1998.
 
  Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share were computed based on the weighted
average number of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock outstanding
as follows:

13. STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN
 
  The long-term portion of the Key Employee Incentive Plan (KEIP), provides
for grants of stock-based compensation awards to senior executives and key
employees of one or more of the following: non-qualified stock options (fixed
stock options), performance stock units, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock units. The KEIP also provides for the deferral of performance
stock unit awards by participants. As of December 31, 1998, 15.3 million
shares were authorized for grants under the long-term portion of the KEIP.
 
  In 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a world-wide, broad-
based employee stock option program, called HSY Growth. HSY Growth provides
all eligible employees with a one-time grant of 100 non-qualified stock
options. Under HSY Growth, over 1.2 million shares were granted on January 7,
1997.
 
  The Corporation applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations in
accounting for the KEIP and HSY Growth. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for its fixed stock option grants. Had compensation cost for
the Corporation's stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates for awards under the KEIP and HSY Growth
consistent with the method of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Corporation's net income
and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below:

  The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: dividend
yields of 1.6%, 1.9% and 2.4%, expected volatility of 21%, 20% and 20%, risk-
free interest rates of 5.9%, 6.2% and 5.6%, and expected lives of 6.5, 5.7 and
7.5 years.

Fixed Stock Options
 
  The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the
Corporation's Common Stock on the date of grant. Under the KEIP, options are
granted in January and generally vest at the end of the second year and have a
maximum term of ten years. Options granted under the HSY Growth program vest
at the end of the fifth year and have a term of ten years.

Performance Stock Units
 
  Under the long-term portion of the KEIP, each January the Corporation grants
selected executives and other key employees performance stock units whose
vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives.
If at the end of three-year performance cycles, targets for financial measures
of earnings per share, economic value added and free cash flow are met, the
full number of shares are awarded to the participants. The performance scores
can range from 0% to 150% of the targeted amounts. The compensation cost
charged against income for the performance-based plan was $6.6 million, $9.1
million and $5.8 million for 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. The

                    RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
  Hershey Foods Corporation is responsible for the financial statements and
other financial information contained in this report. The Corporation believes
that the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles appropriate under the circumstances to reflect
in all material respects the substance of applicable events and transactions.
In preparing the financial statements, it is necessary that management make
informed estimates and judgments. The other financial information in this
annual report is consistent with the financial statements.
 
  The Corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed
to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable for
purposes of preparing financial statements and that assets are properly
accounted for and safeguarded. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on
the recognition that the cost of the system must be related to the benefits to
be derived. The Corporation believes its system provides an appropriate
balance in this regard. The Corporation maintains an Internal Audit Department
which reviews the adequacy and tests the application of internal accounting
controls.
 
  The financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP,
independent public accountants, whose appointment was ratified by stockholder
vote at the stockholders' meeting held on April 28, 1998. Their report
expresses an opinion that the Corporation's financial statements are fairly
stated in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, and they
have indicated to us that their audit was performed in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which are designed to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.
 
  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, consisting
solely of non-management directors, meets regularly with the independent
public accountants, internal auditors and management to discuss, among other
things, the audit scopes and results. Arthur Andersen LLP and the internal
auditors both have full and free access to the Audit Committee, with and
without the presence of management.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of Hershey Foods Corporation:
 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hershey
Foods Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998, appearing on pages A-12 through A-32. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Hershey Foods Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

(b) All shares and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two-for-one
    stock split effective September 13, 1996.

    the loss, Income from Continuing Operations Before Accounting Changes as a
    Percent of Net Sales was 6.8%.

    charge, Income from Continuing Operations Before Accounting Changes as a
    Percent of Net Sales was 5.1%.

     I am pleased to provide to you a copy of Hershey Foods' 1998 Annual Report
     to Stockholders. Also enclosed are a voting instruction card and a Proxy
     Statement which explain the items upon which you are voting. Two methods of

     enclosed proxy card. Your completed card must be received by April 20, 1999

     Please note that if you own shares through the Hershey Employee Stock
