                        To Our Fellow Stockholders:
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        When I joined Hershey Foods Corporation in March 2001, I was
                        excited about the Company's potential. After twelve months of learning about
                        our brands, people, and processes, my enthusiasm continues to build. I'm
                        convinced that by unwrapping Hershey's true potential, we will build a better
                        business. I've experienced first hand Hershey's enduring strengths: iconic
                        brands, the leadership position within the attractive confectionery category,
                        and a loyal, dedicated work force. These factors, built over decades, will
                        continue to provide competitive advantage in the future.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        The new management team's first order of business was to conduct a
                        rigorous situation assessment. While this assessment reaffirmed Hershey's
                        strengths, it also identified key improvement opportunities, particularly in
                        the areas of margins and returns. We're now implementing a strategic agenda
                        which builds on Hershey's strong foundation and capitalizes on significant
                        value-enhancing opportunities. This agenda strikes the appropriate balance
                        between solid top-line growth and improving underlying profitability. The net
                        result will be a competitively-advantaged business which consistently delivers
                        superior financial performance and rewards stockholders.

                   <P>
                        Hershey's strong performance in 2001 illustrates both our
                        strengths, as well as the business's initial response to initiatives designed
                        to deliver balanced sales and earnings growth. Consolidated net sales of $4.6
                        billion increased by 8.0 percent. This gain, primarily all volume, was driven
                        largely by the acquired mint and gum business, with modest growth in our core
                        brands aided by the fourth quarter introduction of <I>Reese's Fast Break</I>
                        and a packaged candy price increase. This sales increase was offset somewhat by
                        our planned product line rationalization and the divestiture of the Luden's
                        throat drops business. Excluding one-time items, continued improvements in the
                        supply chain contributed to a gain of 1.1 percentage points in gross margin to
                        42.6 percent. Particularly gratifying was the excellent progress in lowering
                        logistics expenses and improving customer service achieved with the help of new
                        distribution centers in Central Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Southern California.
                        The combination of solid sales growth and margin improvement resulted

                   <P>
                        Hershey has immense strengths. Hershey's iconic brands define the
                        category. We have twelve $100 million brands, and our products are truly
                        household names. In the United States, we're number one in total confectionery
                        with clear leadership in both the chocolate and non-chocolate categories.
                        Equally important, we posted solid market share gains in 2001.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Confectionery is the largest segment of the $52 billion U.S. snack
                        market. Candy and gum represent 31 percent of this market, larger than either
                        cookies and crackers or salty snacks. With snacking such a part of consumers'
                        lifestyle, confectionery is on-trend, and as we like to say, enjoyable,
                        affordable, portable and available.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Consumers seek out confectionery virtually everywhere they go,
                        making confectionery the highest impulse snack item in the entire U.S. snack
                        category. Given that confectionery is so attractive to consumers, it's also
                        very important to our customers, the retailers. This encourages retailers to
                        provide incremental merchandising displays in their stores, and these displays
                        deliver superior sales results. The combination of these factors helps build
                        expandable consumption; that's why the U.S. confectionery category enjoys a
                        higher retail growth rate than most other food items.

                   <P>
                        In addition to these strengths, what's most impressive is Hershey's
                        loyal and dedicated work force. There are countless employees with long tenure
                        and tremendous depth of industry experience. Our people truly love the company
                        and will do whatever it takes to see it succeed. They're embracing the changes
                        necessary to take Hershey to the next level of performance. Hershey employees
                        represent our most important competitive advantage.

                   <P>
                        Hershey has been an organization with a strong foundation and
                        enduring strengths. In turn, these strengths have delivered strong sales and
                        market share results. In recent years, however, this growth in revenue and
                        market presence has not translated into strong profit growth.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Going forward, we've set more balanced, and thus, more sustainable
                        goals for Hershey. These goals include three to four percent organic sales
                        growth, margin expansion, nine to eleven percent earnings per share-diluted
                        growth, and continued market share gains. Achieving these goals will deliver
                        superior performance and continue to reward stockholders. Clearly, Hershey must
                        change to accomplish these goals, but importantly, we won't change <B>who</B>
                        we are, but we will change <B>what</B> we do.

                        Key opportunities for change were identified in the comprehensive
                        situation assessment mentioned earlier. Specifically, we determined that
                        Hershey was not leveraging its scale brands, margins had not expanded, assets
                        were not fully optimized, and the organization was not properly aligned with
                        the market place. To capitalize on these opportunities and thus achieve our
                        goals, we set a strategic agenda consisting of four imperatives:

                        decision making. It maximizes total brand investment which enhances brand
                        preference and builds sales profitably.

                   <P>
                        We've already taken actions based on our preliminary IBI learnings.
                        For example, advertising spending has been reallocated to our larger, more
                        profitable brands, portfolio-wide consumer events have been added to better
                        leverage our leadership position, and we'll be introducing value-added new
                        products to deliver news and innovation. As 2002 progresses and our IBI
                        learnings continue to build, additional brand building initiatives will be
                        implemented.

                        Brand building, however, is more than just marketing. Experience
                        has demonstrated that the selling function can play a very important role in
                        profitably building our brands. I'm impressed with the outstanding capabilities
                        of the Hershey sales force, and we'll do even more to leverage the strengths of
                        our confectionery sales team.

                        To jump start these efforts, on October 24, 2001, we announced
                        charges to realign our business by eliminating non-strategic brands, closing
                        underutilized facilities, reducing raw material inventories, and reducing
                        administrative costs. Most of these charges were taken in the fourth quarter of
                        2001 and included a charge to cost of sales of $50 million resulting from a
                        reduction in raw material inventory levels, as well as business realignment and
                        asset impairment charges of $228 million. The total charge of $278 million was
                        equivalent to $1.25 per share-diluted, leading to reported net income of $207.2
                        million, or $1.50 per share-diluted in 2001.

                        Specifically, we'll exit certain under-performing businesses. These
                        businesses, along with the sale of the Luden's business, which was completed in
                        the third quarter of 2001, include brands which are lower margin, lower volume,
                        or non-strategic. The elimination of these items and brands, many of which were
                        sold by brokers, enables us to consolidate our remaining confectionery brands
                        back into the direct sales force. This move further builds our selling scale.

                        Supply chain overhead will be reduced with the closure of three
                        manufacturing facilities, as well as one company-owned distribution center.
                        These actions are the result of our ongoing capacity utilization study and
                        improvements in our distribution center network.

                        requirements will further streamline our asset base. In-house pressing
                        operations have been discontinued as this activity added little value. The
                        outsourcing of these intermediate stage ingredients saves additional operating
                        costs while simultaneously avoiding the significant cost of replacing old
                        equipment. In addition, exiting this non-value adding process helped enable
                        significant reduction of raw material inventories.

                   <P>
                        A reduction in staffing levels is also taking place. Our
                        administrative costs as a percentage of sales are higher than industry
                        benchmarks. We'll eliminate twelve percent of our salaried work force or about
                        600 people. Given the demographics of Hershey's work force, this reduction is
                        being accomplished on a voluntary retirement or mutual separation basis.

                        The overall realignment charge of $310 million equates to $1.39 per
                        share-diluted, with projected annualized savings of $75-$80 million when fully
                        implemented. Consistent with our strategic direction, on-going savings will be
                        invested substantially in enhanced brand building and selling

                        During Ken's tenure as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, he put
                        a strong emphasis on creation of economic value and enhanced cash flow, and
                        brought a strong focus to the company's structure by shedding non-strategic
                        businesses and making key complementary acquisitions such as Leaf North America
                        and the intense mint and gum business. Ken spearheaded the implementation of a
                        corporate-wide information system, successfully positioning Hershey for
                        managing its business in an increasingly complex environment, and he initiated
                        a management succession program to enable the company to achieve enhanced
                        levels of performance. His eight years of leadership saw increased sales and
                        earnings, culminating with a stock price which grew at a rate of 13.5 percent
                        compounded. Ken was of immense assistance to me during 2001, providing sound

                   <P>
                        During the final months of 2001, we began the execution of the
                        realignment and continued the brand building and sales force initiatives begun
                        earlier in the year. By the end of the first half of 2002, we expect to
                        substantially complete these initiatives. During the second half of the year,
                        we will begin to invest the cost savings generated by the realignment and other
                        programs in brand building activities and further enhancement to our sales
                        force capability. This sets the stage for ongoing excellence in 2003 and
                        beyond. Our strategy is fundamentally sound, and our effort is focused on
                        execution. As these programs take hold and our brands begin to respond to the
                        marketing and selling initiatives, we'll truly unwrap Hershey's potential and
                        create a better balance between growth, profitability and return on investment.

                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Hershey experienced an enormous amount of change in 2001. Our
                        employees have embraced Hershey's new strategic direction and are now working
                        very hard to implement our plans. At the beginning of 2002, the most visible
                        change is the impact of the Early Retirement Program. This program was designed
                        to allow long-tenured employees to take advantage of the many years which
                        they've devoted to Hershey and also help us bring our total costs in line.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        We thank our retiring employees for their contributions to
                        Hershey's success and wish them well as they venture into the next chapter of
                        their lives. While a lot of great people are leaving, many great people remain
                        with Hershey, and opportunities for personal advancement have been greatly
                        accelerated as a result. We have much work to do, but I have enormous
                        confidence in everyone on the Hershey team.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Thank you for investing in Hershey and our future growth prospects.
                        We will continue to unwrap the potential of this great company delivering
                        superior value to all of our stockholders.

                        is currently a member of the Board of Directors (the "Board"). Kenneth L.
                        Wolfe, formerly Chairman of the Board and a director, retired from the Board on

                        ("Common Stock"), voting separately as a class. The nominees receiving the
                        greatest number of votes of the holders of the Common Stock voting separately
                        as a class will be elected.

                        Stock and Class B Stock voting together will be elected. In case any of the
                        nominees should become unavailable for election for any reason not presently
                        known or contemplated, the persons named on the proxy card will have

                        Directors who are employees of the Corporation receive no
                        remuneration for their services as directors.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        The compensation for non-employee directors set forth in the table
                        above was approved by the directors in October 2001. From January 1997 through
                        September 2001, the directors were paid an annual retainer of $42,500, $1,500
                        for each Board meeting attended and $1,000 for each committee meeting attended.
                        Committee chairs were also paid an annual retainer of $3,000. One-third of the
                        annual retainer was required to be paid in Common Stock, with the remainder
                        taken in cash or Common Stock (with meeting and chair fees payable only in
                        cash). Following a review of competitive data, which disclosed the need to
                        adjust the retainer and fees to bring the directors' compensation in line with
                        comparable companies, the new compensation program was adopted.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        A principal feature of the new compensation program is the addition
                        of restricted stock unit ("RSU") grants. RSUs are granted quarterly to each
                        director on the first day of January, April, July and October on the basis of
                        the number of shares of Common Stock, valued at the average closing price on
                        the New York Stock Exchange of the Common Stock on the last three trading days
                        preceding the grant, equal to $10,000. While the value of the annual RSU grant
                        is targeted at $40,000, the actual value of the grant may be higher or lower
                        depending upon the performance of the Common Stock following the grant dates. A
                        director's RSUs will vest and be distributed upon his or her retirement from
                        the Board.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        As in the prior compensation program, a director may defer receipt
                        of the retainer and committee chair fees until his or her retirement from the
                        Board. Finally, given the significant equity interest that RSUs provide in the
                        director's compensation program, the previous requirement that one-third of the
                        retainer be paid in Common Stock was discontinued.

                        program. The amount of the charitable donation per current participating

                   <P>
                        The role of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is to
                        assist the Board in its oversight of the Corporation's financial reporting
                        process. The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are
                        "independent," as required by applicable listing standards of the New York
                        Stock Exchange. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a Charter that was
                        last amended and restated by the Board on February 7, 2001. As set forth in the
                        Charter, management of the Corporation is responsible for the preparation,
                        presentation and integrity of the Corporation's financial statements, the
                        Corporation's accounting and financial reporting principles, and internal
                        controls designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable
                        laws and regulations. The independent auditors are responsible for auditing the
                        Corporation's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their
                        conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee
                        has considered and discussed the audited financial statements with management
                        and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the
                        independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Statement on
                        Auditing Standards No. 61, <I>Communication with Audit Committees</I>, as
                        currently in effect. Finally, the Audit Committee has received the written
                        disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by
                        Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, <I>Independence Discussions with
                        Audit Committees</I>, as currently in effect, has discussed with the
                        independent auditors the auditors' independence from the Corporation and its
                        management, and has considered whether the provision of non-audit services to
                        the Corporation by the independent auditors is compatible with maintaining the
                        auditors' independence.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        The members of the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged
                        in the practice of auditing or accounting, are not employed by the Corporation
                        for accounting, financial management or internal control purposes, and are not
                        experts in the fields of accounting or auditing, including with respect to
                        auditor independence. Members of the Audit Committee rely, without independent
                        verification, on the information provided to them and on the representations
                        made by management and the independent auditors. Accordingly, the Audit
                        Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that
                        management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting
                        principles and policies or internal controls and procedures designed to assure
                        compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.
                        Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to
                        above do not assure that the audit of the Corporation's financial statements
                        has been carried out in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
                        in the United States, that the financial statements are presented in accordance
                        with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or that the
                        Corporation's auditors are in fact "independent."

                        The Corporation has shares of two classes of stock outstanding,
                        Common Stock and Class B Stock. At the close of business on March 1, 2002, the
                        record date for the Annual Meeting, there were outstanding 106,555,905 shares
                        of Common Stock and 30,433,808 shares of Class B Stock, all of which are
                        entitled to be voted. Holders of record of the Corporation's Common Stock on
                        March 1, 2002 will be entitled to cast one vote for each share held, and
                        holders of record of the Class B Stock on March 1, 2002 will be entitled to
                        cast ten votes for each share held. The Common Stock is entitled to cash
                        dividends 10% higher than those declared on the Class B Stock.

                        According to the Corporation's By-Laws, the presence in person or

                        outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock, respectively, shall constitute

                        Stock voting separately as a class and the holders of the Class B Stock voting
                        separately as a class. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a
                        majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the combined outstanding shares of
                        the Common Stock and the Class B Stock shall constitute a quorum for matters to

                        Certificate and By-Laws. The specific vote requirements for the proposals being
                        submitted to a stockholder vote at this year's Annual Meeting are set forth
                        under the description of each proposal in this Proxy Statement.

                        Abstentions and broker non-votes (defined below) are counted for
                        the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.
                        For the purpose of determining whether a proposal (except for the election of
                        directors) has received a majority vote, abstentions will be included in the
                        vote totals with the result that an abstention will have the same effect as a
                        negative vote. In instances where brokers are prohibited from exercising
                        discretionary authority for beneficial owners who have not returned a proxy
                        ("broker non-votes"), those shares will not be included in the vote totals and,
                        therefore, will have no effect on the vote.

                   arrangements with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in 2001, pursuant to which on April
                   27, May 18, May 30 and June 8 he wrote a covered call option and purchased a
                   put option for 37,000, 20,000, 30,000 and 38,000 shares, respectively, of
                   Common Stock. In each such arrangement, only one of the options can be in the
                   money on the expiration date, at which time the in-the-money option will be
                   exercised (and settled for in cash), and the other option will expire. If
                   neither option is in the money on the expiration date, both options will

                        The purpose of the Key Employee Incentive Plan (the "Incentive
                        Plan") is to provide key employees with incentives to work for the growth and
                        success of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Incentive Plan helps the
                        Corporation to achieve competitive compensation levels and is designed to meet
                        the present and anticipated needs of the Corporation in attracting, retaining
                        and rewarding key employees having outstanding dedication and ability. The
                        Incentive Plan consists of two separate programs &#150; an Annual Incentive
                        Program ("AIP") that rewards key employees based on their performance relative
                        to annual operating objectives and a Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP") that
                        rewards longer term objectives.

                        The Incentive Plan was originally adopted and approved by the Board
                        and stockholders in 1987 and has been amended on various occasions since that
                        time, most significantly in 1997 when the Board and stockholders approved
                        amendments to conform certain provisions of the Plan to the requirements of the
                        "performance-based" compensation exception to the deduction limitations of
                        Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
                        and to eliminate the requirement for stockholder approval of certain amendments
                        (the "1997 Amendments"). In February 2002, the Board amended the Incentive Plan
                        to increase to 19,000,000 the number of shares available for awards from the
                        13,000,000 previously approved by the stockholders, to update the provisions
                        relating to the requirements of "performance-based" compensation under Section
                        162(m) of the Code and to make certain procedural changes (the "2002
                        Amendments"). Although the amendments have not been made contingent on receipt
                        of stockholder approval, the Board has directed that the amendments increasing
                        the number of shares available for issuance under the Incentive Plan and
                        updating the performance-based compensation provisions be submitted to the
                        stockholders for approval so that certain awards granted under the Incentive
                        Plan may qualify as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of
                        the Code and to comply with certain requirements of the New York Stock
                        Exchange.

                        other stock-based incentives play an important role in attracting and retaining
                        the services of outstanding employees and linking the interests and efforts of
                        the employees to the long-term interests of the Corporation's stockholders. As
                        of February 12, 2002, the stockholders had approved 13,000,000 shares for
                        issuance for awards under the Incentive Plan, of which 11,698,734 shares had
                        been previously issued, 8,538,351 shares were subject to awards outstanding,
                        and only 1,301,266 shares remained available for new awards. At its meeting on
                        February 13, 2002, the Board approved, and is seeking stockholder approval of,
                        an increase of 6,000,000 shares in the number of shares available for issuance
                        of awards. The Incentive Plan provides that shares subject to awards which are
                        forfeited or terminated, expire unexercised, are settled in cash in lieu of
                        shares or in a manner in which some or all of the shares subject to the award
                        are not issued or surrendered, will again be available for issuance under the
                        Plan. Shares issued under the Incentive Plan may be either authorized but
                        unissued shares, treasury shares held by the Corporation or any direct or
                        indirect subsidiary thereof, or shares acquired by the Corporation through open
                        market purchases or otherwise. Although the Corporation intends to issue
                        treasury shares in connection with awards made under the Plan, the Board is
                        submitting the increase in the number of shares available for

                        no limitation on the deductibility of "performance-based" compensation. In
                        general, to qualify as "performance-based" compensation (i) the compensation
                        must be paid solely on account of the attainment of one or more pre-established
                        objective performance goals; (ii) the performance goals under which
                        compensation is paid must be established by a compensation committee comprised
                        solely of two or more directors who qualify as "outside directors" for purposes
                        of the exception; (iii) the material terms under which the compensation is to
                        be paid must be disclosed to and subsequently approved by stockholders of the
                        corporation; and (iv) the compensation committee must certify in writing before
                        payment of the compensation that the performance goals and any other material
                        terms were in fact satisfied. Regulations issued under Section 162(m) require
                        that criteria used to establish business performance goals and the maximum
                        payouts under a plan be determined and disclosed to stockholders as part of the
                        plan approval process.

                        As a part of the 1997 Amendments, the Board of Directors amended
                        the Incentive Plan to limit the number of stock options, stock appreciation
                        rights ("SARs") and restricted stock units ("RSUs") that may be granted to
                        individual participants during any calendar year. The Board also capped the
                        payouts that individual participants can receive under the AIP and performance
                        stock unit ("PSU") sections of the Incentive Plan. Under the 1997 Amendments,
                        the number of shares of Common Stock that could be covered by stock options,
                        SARs and RSUs awarded to a participant during a calendar year was 250,000 with
                        respect to stock options, 250,000 with respect to SARs, and 50,000 with respect
                        to RSUs. The maximum annual payout a participant could receive under AIP was
                        capped at $2,100,000, and the maximum annual payout a participant could receive
                        under the PSU portion of the Incentive Plan was $2,430,000.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Following the Board's review of competitive data, which disclosed
                        that the limitations established in 1997 were no longer compatible with those
                        of comparable companies, the Board, with the 2002 Amendments, adjusted the
                        limits and maximum payouts under the Incentive Plan and modified the criteria
                        upon which performance-based objectives may be established. With the 2002
                        Amendments, the number of shares of Common Stock that may be covered by stock
                        options, SARs and RSUs awarded to a participant during a calendar year was
                        increased from 250,000 to 500,000 with respect to stock options, from 250,000
                        to 500,000 with respect to SARs and from 50,000 to 75,000 with respect to RSUs.
                        The maximum annual payout a participant can receive under AIP was increased
                        from $2,100,000 to $3,000,000 and the maximum annual payout a participant can
                        receive under the PSU portion of the Incentive Plan was raised from PSUs with a
                        value of $2,430,000 to 75,000 PSUs.

                   <P>
                        With the 2002 Amendments, the pre-established, objective
                        performance goals established by the Committee in connection with
                        performance-based awards may be based on one or more of the following business
                        criteria: earnings per share, return on net assets, market share, control of
                        costs, net sales, cash flow, return on invested capital, economic value-added
                        measures, sales growth, earnings growth, stock price, return on equity,
                        financial ratings, regulatory compliance, achievement of balance sheet or
                        income statement objectives, or other financial, accounting or quantitative
                        objectives established by the Committee (collectively, the "Performance
                        Objectives"). Performance Objectives may be particular to a participant or the
                        division, line of business or other unit in which the participant works, or the
                        Corporation generally, or may be absolute in their terms or measured against or
                        in relationship to the performance of a peer group or other external or
                        internal measure. A Performance Objective may include or exclude items to
                        measure specific objectives, including, without limitation, extraordinary or
                        other non-recurring items, acquisitions and divestitures, internal
                        restructuring and reorganizations, accounting charges and effects of accounting
                        changes. The Board is submitting the changes to the maximum amounts which may
                        be paid or granted with respect to awards under the Plan and the provisions

                        The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation and
                        Executive Organization Committee of the Board (the "Committee"). The current
                        membership of the Committee is set forth in the section of this Proxy Statement
                        entitled "Board Committees." The Committee has general authority to administer
                        and interpret the provisions of the Incentive Plan and adopt such rules and
                        regulations as it deems necessary or desirable. Its other functions involve
                        such matters as the selection of participants and the determination of the
                        kind, number, amounts, terms and provisions of grants under the Incentive Plan
                        to such persons. The Board has authorized the Committee to delegate to the
                        Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation authority to grant awards to
                        individuals other than executive officers. The Committee's or its delegate's
                        determinations are conclusive.

                        The Incentive Plan provides flexibility in creating incentive
                        packages for specific individuals as well as various groups of key employees.
                        Persons eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan are broadly defined to
                        include those officers, executive, administrative, professional and other
                        employees who, in the opinion of the Committee, are in a position to contribute
                        to the success of the Corporation. Directors who are employees of the
                        Corporation are also eligible to receive awards under the Incentive Plan.

                        Plan provides that annual contingent target incentive grants are established
                        for each participant and awards are paid in cash based on both a personal and a
                        Performance Objective factor. Payment of all or a portion of such awards may be
                        deferred by the participant with the approval of the Committee. The calculation
                        of an award under the AIP is further described in the Annual Incentive Program
                        section of the Committee's Report in this Proxy Statement.

                        the opportunity for key employees in positions affecting the long-term
                        performance of the Corporation to earn awards related to the achievement of
                        goals based on the Corporation's long-range strategic plan. Under the Incentive
                        Plan, each year the Committee sets specific Performance Objectives for the new,
                        long-term performance cycle and grants contingently units (each of which
                        represents one share of Common Stock) payable upon the achievement of the
                        objectives. The Incentive Plan provides that the Committee may establish the
                        length of each cycle at its discretion, subject to a five-year maximum period.
                        After completion of each cycle, awards are paid in Common Stock or in a
                        combination of Common Stock and cash, depending on the extent such objectives
                        were achieved. Payment of all or a portion of such award may be deferred by the
                        participant with the approval of the Committee.

                        As a general rule, the holder of PSUs must have participated in the
                        performance cycle for its entire period to be eligible to receive an award.
                        However, upon termination of employment due to retirement, total disability or
                        death, a pro-rata award will be paid provided that the employee was employed
                        for at least two-thirds of the applicable performance cycle. In the event that
                        the employee otherwise resigns or is discharged by the Corporation for any
                        reason, such participant's rights and interests under the Incentive Plan will

                        the Incentive Plan are nonqualified for purposes of the Code. The period during
                        which a key employee can exercise his or her stock options is determined by the
                        Committee, but no option is exercisable for a period longer than ten years from
                        the date of grant. The purchase price payable upon the exercise of a stock
                        option is not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common
                        Stock based on the closing market price on the business day immediately
                        preceding the date the option is granted. The purchase price may be paid either
                        in cash or in Common Stock, or any combination of cash and Common Stock. Other
                        terms and conditions of the option are determined by the Committee which, among
                        other things, may stipulate specific exercise terms including times and
                        frequency of exercise and minimum or maximum numbers of options that may be

                        As a general rule, all stock options expire at the end of the
                        participant's employment. However, except as may be provided differently in the
                        participant's stock option agreement, in the case of an option held by an
                        employee whose employment ends due to retirement, total disability or death,
                        the employee or his estate must exercise the option within five years of the
                        date of retirement, total disability or death. For options issued prior to
                        1997, the exercise period after retirement, disability or death is three years.
                        In the event that the participant otherwise resigns or is discharged by the
                        Corporation for any reason, the option will end automatically upon notice of

                        exercise, the holder of SARs receives a payment in cash or shares of Common
                        Stock or a combination of both, at the discretion of the Committee, equal to
                        the difference between the fair market value of the shares at the time of
                        exercise and at the time the SARs were granted. Other terms of the grant,
                        including targets and conditions for the grant, are established by the
                        Committee. Targets and conditions of an award may be either objective or

                        Under the Incentive Plan, SARs may be related to or separate from
                        stock options, as the Committee determines. SARs related to options are
                        exercisable in whole or in part only at such times and to the extent that the
                        options to which they relate are exercisable, and upon exercise of the SARs the
                        number of shares purchasable pursuant to the related options will be reduced on
                        a one-for-one basis. Upon termination of employment, SARs are exercisable to
                        the same extent as are stock options as described in the preceding section.

                        <I>Restricted Stock Units.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An RSU is a
                        right granted to a key employee to receive either cash or shares of Common
                        Stock or a combination of both without payment to the Corporation, conditioned
                        upon continued employment with the Corporation throughout a specified
                        restriction period. If payment is to be made in cash, the amount will be
                        determined by multiplying the number of RSUs paid out by the fair market value
                        of a share of Common Stock at the time the restriction period ends. If payment
                        is made in Common Stock, the number of shares paid shall be equal to the number
                        of RSUs granted contingently. Targets and conditions of an award are determined
                        by the Committee and may be based on one or more of the Performance Objectives.
                        Only awards subject to Performance Objectives will qualify for the
                        "performance-based" exemption under Section 162(m). Payment of shares or cash
                        under an award may be deferred by the participant with approval of the
                        Committee.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        As a general rule, a holder of RSUs must remain employed throughout
                        the restriction period to be eligible to receive a payment, although a pro-rata
                        award will be paid upon termination of employment due to total disability or
                        death. Upon the occurrence of a change in control, all restrictions on RSUs
                        held by a participant lapse. Generally, in the event of retirement or discharge
                        by the Corporation for any reason, a participant's RSUs will terminate
                        automatically.

                        RSUs will not realize any income, nor will the Corporation receive any
                        deduction, for Federal income tax purposes, in the year of the grant.

                   <P>
                        Ordinary income will be realized by the participant at the time
                        that he or she receives payment of an AIP award, or that shares are transferred
                        or cash is distributed to him or her in payment of a PSU or RSU award, or
                        pursuant to his or her exercise of a stock option or SAR. In the case of PSUs
                        or SARs, the amount of income will be equal to the cash received or the fair
                        market value of the shares issued plus the amount of any cash or shares
                        withheld to pay withholding taxes. In the case of a stock option, the amount of
                        income will be equal to the difference between the option exercise price and
                        the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock on the date of exercise.
                        Ordinary income will be realized by a holder of RSUs in the year in which the
                        restriction period ends and such units are paid, in an amount equal to the cash
                        received or the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock issued plus the
                        amount of any cash or shares withheld to pay withholding taxes. The Corporation
                        will receive a deduction on its consolidated Federal income tax return for the
                        taxable year in the amount of such ordinary income realized by an Incentive
                        Plan participant.

                        treated as long-term or short-term capital gain, depending upon the holding
                        period of the shares. If the amount received is less than that value, the loss
                        will be treated as long-term or short-term capital loss, depending upon the
                        holding period of the shares.

                        consultant at its discretion. This annual review includes analyzing survey data
                        comparing the competitiveness of the Corporation's executive compensation,
                        corporate performance, stock price appreciation and total return to
                        stockholders with a peer group of companies representing the Corporation's most
                        direct food industry competitors for executive talent. The Committee also
                        considers compensation data compiled from surveys of a broader group of
                        industrial companies, some of which are from the food industry. In the
                        Performance Graph on page 29, the Corporation's performance is compared, in
                        part, to the Standard and Poor's Food Group Index. The peer group considered
                        relevant for the Corporation's compensation comparison purposes does not
                        include all of the companies in the Food Group Index as compensation data on
                        all such companies are not readily available. Also, the peer group includes
                        some companies that are not in the Food Group Index because the Corporation
                        selects those companies it believes to be direct competitors for executive
                        talent. The Committee reviews which peer companies are selected for
                        compensation analysis.

                        In the review of survey data, a statistical process involving
                        regression analysis is used to determine competitive compensation levels. This
                        approach adjusts compensation levels for factors such as net sales, return on
                        equity and time in position within the organization to determine predicted
                        values or "going rates" within the marketplace for each element of
                        compensation. The Corporation targets total compensation "at or above" such
                        "going rates."

                        portion of each executive officer's total compensation is linked directly to
                        individual and corporate performance and to stock price appreciation.

                        Incentives play an important role in motivating executive
                        performance and in aligning executive pay practices with the interests of the
                        stockholders. The Corporation's executive compensation program is intended to
                        reward achievement of both short- and long-term business goals. To ensure
                        proper balance in the achievement of these business goals, the incentive
                        program places greater dollars at risk in long-term incentives compared to
                        short-term incentives. The long-term incentive program is designed especially
                        to ensure that the Corporation's executive officers have a significant portion
                        of their total compensation tied to factors which affect the performance of the
                        Corporation's Common Stock.

                        and R. H. Lenny, who on March 12, 2001 was elected President and Chief
                        Executive Officer, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. The Committee

                        Salary reviews are conducted annually and salary adjustments are
                        made based upon the performance of the Corporation and of each executive
                        officer and his or her position in the applicable salary grade. The Committee
                        considers both financial and, where appropriate, non-financial performance
                        measures in making salary adjustments. Base salaries for executive officers and
                        all other salaried employees are set within salary ranges established for their
                        positions as determined through the annual competitive salary surveys described
                        above. In the case of executive officers with responsibility for a particular

                        Individual and short-term (annual) corporate and business unit
                        performance objectives are established at the beginning of each year by the
                        Committee. For executive officers at the corporate level, the performance
                        objectives for AIP award payments for 2001 were based on financial measures
                        including diluted earnings per share and economic value added. For executive
                        officers at the business unit level, the performance objectives for 2001 were
                        varying combinations of diluted earnings per share; economic value added;
                        business unit contribution income; and various sales, growth rate and customer
                        service objectives. Adjustments are made to the performance results, if
                        necessary, to take into account extraordinary or unusual items occurring during
                        the performance year. Payment of annual cash incentive awards may be deferred
                        to a later date at the election of the executive officer. Since the final award
                        is the product of the factors described above, the corporate or business unit
                        performance and individual performance scores are given equal weight in the

                        individual executive officer receiving more than his or her target percentage.
                        The maximum corporate or business unit performance score for an executive
                        officer in 2001 was 200%. The maximum score on the individual performance score
                        was 160%, with the Committee having discretion to adjust this percentage
                        downward. The range of the target percentages of base salary used in 2001 for
                        annual cash incentive awards for executive officers was 35% to 80%, with the
                        highest rate of 80% applicable to Messrs. Wolfe and Lenny.

                        Performance stock units ("PSUs") were granted contingently in

                        results (a combined total of 29 individuals in 2001). PSU grants are based upon
                        a percentage of the executive's annual salary. PSUs are granted every year and
                        are earned based upon the Corporation's performance over a three-year cycle.
                        Each year begins a new three-year cycle. Provided the Corporation has achieved
                        the established performance objectives at the end of the three-year cycle, a
                        payment is made either in shares of Common Stock, cash, or a combination of
                        both, based on the market value of the shares at the end of the cycle. In
                        determining whether performance objectives have been achieved, specific
                        adjustments established by the Committee may be made to the corporate
                        performance to take into account extraordinary or unusual items occurring
                        during the performance cycle. Payment of PSU awards may be deferred to a later
                        date at the election of the executive. The value of each of the PSUs is tied to
                        corporate performance (in determining what percentage of shares is earned) and
                        stock price appreciation. The established performance measures for PSUs awarded
                        in 2001 are cumulative diluted earnings per share and economic value added,
                        along with peer metrics of total shareholder return, sales growth and return on
                        total assets as compared against the performance of the S&amp;P Food Group. The

                        additional information regarding PSU grants for K. L. Wolfe and R. H. Lenny,
                        the four most highly-compensated executive officers other than Messrs. Wolfe
                        and Lenny, and M. F. Pasquale, a former executive officer who resigned in
                        December 2000 (collectively the "named executive officers").

                   <P>
                        Under the Incentive Plan, stock options are granted periodically to
                        the Corporation's senior executive group as well as to other key managerial and
                        professional employees. Stock options entitle the holder to purchase during a
                        specified time period a fixed number of shares of Common Stock at a set price.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        The Committee sets guidelines for the number of stock options to be
                        granted based on competitive compensation data gathered from the survey
                        information discussed above. The number of stock options granted is a function
                        of the employee's base pay, stock option multiples for the employee's grade
                        level and the imputed value of the option. The Committee also takes into
                        account management's recommendations regarding the number of options to be
                        awarded to specific employees as well as competitive pay practices within the
                        food industry and the amount of options outstanding or granted previously.
                        While stock options have been granted annually to members of the senior
                        executive group, the Committee may elect not to grant stock options in a given
                        year. Stock option recipients other than the senior executive group (over 500
                        key employees) generally receive stock option grants every two years.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Beginning with stock options granted after 1995, employees desiring
                        to receive cash upon exercise through a same-day purchase and sale transaction
                        must first meet certain minimum stockholding requirements. If the minimums are
                        not satisfied, an individual can receive only one-half of the after-tax profit
                        from the option exercise in cash. The remaining one-half of the profit must be
                        retained in Common Stock. Minimum stockholding requirements range from one to
                        five times base salary. For K. L. Wolfe and R. H. Lenny, the applicable
                        multiple in 2001 was five times their respective base salaries.
                   </P>

                        Stock options are designed to align the interests of executives
                        with those of the stockholders. Stock options are granted with a ten-year term
                        and an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Common Stock on
                        the business day preceding the date of grant. Starting in 1997, and again in
                        1998 and 1999, stock options granted to the senior executive group had a
                        two-year vesting requirement similar to that already applicable to the
                        non-senior management group receiving options. Beginning in 2000, stock options
                        granted to all eligible recipients, including the senior executive group, have
                        a four-year step vesting requirement of 25% per year, with full vesting
                        occurring at the end of the fourth year following the date of grant. These
                        approaches are designed as incentives for future performance by the creation of
                        stockholder value over the long term since the benefit of the stock options
                        cannot be realized unless stock price appreciation occurs.

                        In 2001, K. L. Wolfe received options to purchase 66,400 shares of
                        Common Stock with an exercise price of $58.50 per share, the closing market
                        price on the day preceding the grant. In 2001,

                        R. H. Lenny received options to purchase 480,700 shares of Common
                        Stock with an exercise price of $64.65 per share, the closing market price on
                        the day preceding the grant. Of Mr. Lenny's total grant, 400,000 options were
                        granted as a sign-on award.

                        During 2001, the Committee awarded RSUs to certain named executive
                        officers, including R. H. Lenny, hired by the Corporation in 2001. The RSUs
                        were granted under the Incentive Plan for the purpose of replacing compensation
                        forfeited by the executives as a result of their resignations from their former
                        employers. In the case of R. H. Lenny, the Committee granted 50,000 RSUs on
                        March 12, 2001, and 15,542 RSUs on January 2, 2002. One-half of the total grant
                        vested on March 12, 2002, and the remainder will vest on March 12, 2003.

                   <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Policy Regarding Tax Deductibility of Executive
                        Compensation </H3>
                   <P>
                        Section 162(m) of the Code provides that publicly-held companies
                        may be limited in deducting certain compensation in excess of $1 million paid
                        to the chief executive officer and the four other most highly-compensated
                        officers. The Committee has considered the effect of Section 162(m) of the Code
                        on the Corporation's executive compensation program to develop its policy with
                        respect to the deductibility of the Corporation's executive compensation. It is
                        the Committee's position that in administering the "performance-based" portion
                        of the Corporation's executive compensation program, it will attempt to comply
                        with the requirements of Section 162(m). However, the Committee believes that
                        it needs to retain the flexibility to exercise its judgment in assessing an
                        executive's performance and that the total compensation system for executive
                        officers should be managed in accordance with the objectives outlined in the
                        "Executive Compensation Philosophy" section of this report and in the best
                        overall interest of the Corporation's stockholders. Should compliance with
                        Section 162(m) conflict with the Executive Compensation Philosophy or with what
                        the Committee believes to be in the best interest of the stockholders, the
                        Committee will act in accordance with the Executive Compensation Philosophy and
                        in the best interest of the stockholders, notwithstanding the effect of such
                        action on deductibility for any given year. However, to ensure that the
                        Corporation does not lose deductions for compensation paid, the Committee has
                        adopted a deferral policy requiring the executive to defer receipt of any
                        compensation in excess of $1 million that is not deductible in any given year
                        to the year in which such compensation would be deductible by the Corporation.

                   <P>
                        In 2001, as in previous years, a substantial portion of the
                        Corporation's executive compensation consisted of performance-based variable
                        elements. The Committee intends to continue the policy of linking executive
                        compensation to corporate performance and returns to stockholders.

                        Corporation and R. H. Lenny on March 12, 2001, Mr. Lenny is entitled to an
                        annual salary during the term of the agreement of not less than $750,000 and to
                        participate in the Annual and Long-Term Incentive Programs of the Incentive
                        Plan and in the Corporation's other executive and employee benefit programs.
                        The employment agreement also provides for a one-time sign-on award, in lieu of
                        participation in certain on-going corporate incentive programs, of 400,000
                        stock options (at a price of $64.65, the closing price of the Common Stock on

                        compensation forfeited as a result of his resignation from his prior employer.

                        Mr. Lenny's employment without cause, he will be entitled to a lump-sum
                        severance benefit equal to his annual salary and AIP bonus for two years,
                        vesting of restricted stock awards, continued vesting of stock option awards

                        Plan are consistent with the practices followed by other major
                        public corporations in the U.S. and generally provide that in the event the
                        executive's employment with the Corporation terminates within two years after a
                        "change in control" of the Corporation, the executive is entitled to certain
                        severance payments and benefits. A "change in control" is defined to include an
                        event in which the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer holds voting control
                        of the Corporation and another party acquires 25% or more of the combined
                        voting power of common equity of the Corporation. Under the Benefits Protection
                        Plan, upon an executive officer's termination after a change in control as
                        described above, and in order to assist the executive in transitioning to new
                        employment, the executive generally would be entitled to receive in a lump sum
                        three times the executive's base salary, AIP bonus and PSU payout. The
                        executive also would be entitled to continuation of health benefits for a
                        period of three years and reimbursement for Federal excise taxes payable (but
                        not for income taxes payable). The executive also would become vested in
                        benefits under existing compensation and benefit programs (including those
                        described in the Executive Compensation section) and generally would be paid
                        such benefits at the time of the executive's termination from a grantor trust
                        to be established and funded at the time of any such change in control. Also,
                        beginning in 2001, executive officers other than M. F. Pasquale became entitled
                        to receive certain severance payments and benefits if their employment with the
                        Corporation is terminated in the absence of a change in control, provided that
                        the termination is not for "cause" as defined in the Benefits Protection Plan.
                        In the event of such termination, the executive will be placed on a two-year
                        leave of absence, during which time the executive will receive his base salary,
                        AIP bonus, previously earned and/or deferred AIP bonus and PSU awards, and
                        benefit programs to which the executive had been entitled while in active
                        employment (excluding disability coverage).

                        Executive officers are eligible to receive pension benefits payable
                        under the Corporation's qualified defined benefit pension plan ("Pension
                        Plan"), as well as the nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that
                        provides benefits in excess of those that may be provided under plans (such as
                        the Pension Plan) that are subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue
                        Code. The combined benefit paid to a participant pursuant to these plans is
                        equal to 55% of that individual's final average compensation. Final average
                        compensation is determined by adding the participant's three-year average of
                        base salary and five-year average AIP bonus. The combined amounts paid under
                        the two plans are reduced by any applicable Social Security benefits received,
                        by a specified percentage for each month that retirement occurs before age 60,
                        and by a specified percentage for each year that retirement occurs prior to the

                        In the fall of 2001, the Board approved an early retirement plan
                        for those full-time salaried employees (including the executive officers) of
                        the Corporation on October 24, 2001 (and those former full-time employees who
                        had retired after June 30 and on or before November 1, 2001) who were actively
                        employed by the Corporation on December 31, 1998 and had attained the age of 45
                        on or before that date. To receive enhanced benefits under the plan, employees
                        had to elect on or before December 14, 2001 to retire on January 1, February 1,
                        or March 1, 2002, or under special circumstances the first day of a later month
                        but not later than January 1, 2003. Employees electing the program were
                        credited with having worked an additional five years, and their basic
                        retirement accounts as of December 31, 2001 were increased by an amount equal
                        to what their accounts would have been credited had they continued to work for
                        the Corporation during those five additional years. Plan participants are also
                        entitled to purchase retiree medical benefits at rates based upon their
                        enhanced credited years of service and, if under 62 years of age on their date
                        of retirement, receive a Social Security supplemental benefit payment until
                        they reach the age of 62.

                        During 2001, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had a number of
                        transactions with Milton Hershey School, the Milton Hershey School Trust, and
                        companies owned by the Milton Hershey School Trust, involving the purchase or
                        sale of goods and services. These transactions were primarily with Hershey
                        Entertainment &amp; Resorts Company, based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and
                        wholly-owned by the Milton Hershey School Trust.

                        and services from these entities in the amount of approximately $1,700,000.
                        These transactions were on terms that the Corporation believes to be no less
                        favorable to the Corporation than those which could have been obtained from
                        other purchasers or vendors.

                        Hershey Foods Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Corporation")
                        are engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of consumer food
                        products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line of chocolate
                        and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products. The Corporation was
                        organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927, as a
                        successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey.
                   </P>
                   <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </H3>
                   <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Net Sales </H3>
                   <P>
                        Net sales rose $336.3 million, or 8%, from 2000 to 2001. The
                        increase in 2001 was primarily due to incremental sales from the mint and gum
                        businesses acquired from Nabisco, Inc. in December 2000 and increases in sales
                        of base confectionery and grocery products, primarily resulting from the
                        introduction of new confectionery products, selected confectionery selling
                        price increases in the United States, and increased international exports.
                        These increases were partially offset by lower sales resulting from the
                        divestiture of the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business and the impact of
                        unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        Net sales rose $250.1 million, or 6%, from 1999 to 2000. The higher
                        sales primarily reflected an increase in sales of base confectionery and
                        grocery products in North America, including incremental sales from the
                        introduction of new confectionery products, increased international exports and
                        lower product returns, discounts and allowances. In 2000, certain international
                        distributor allowances were netted against sales instead of being reported in
                        selling, marketing and administrative expenses as in 1999. Distributor
                        allowances in 1999 amounted to $18.3 million. Net sales in 1999 included $29.3
                        million related to the Corporation's pasta business, which was sold in January
                        1999.
                   </P>
                   <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Gross Margin </H3>
                   <P>
                        Gross margin was 41.5% in 2000 and 2001. Gross margin in 2001 was
                        negatively impacted 1.1 percentage points from the inclusion in cost of sales
                        of a charge of $50.1 million associated with business realignment initiatives
                        recorded during the fourth quarter. The $50.1 million charge to cost of sales
                        resulted from the reduction of raw material inventories, principally cocoa
                        beans and cocoa butter, no longer required to support operations as a result of
                        outsourcing the manufacture of certain ingredients. Excluding the impact of the
                        business realignment initiatives, the increase in gross margin to 42.6%
                        resulted from lower costs for freight, distribution and warehousing, as well as
                        improved supply chain efficiencies including decreased costs for the disposal
                        of aged finished goods inventory and obsolete packaging. Selected confectionery
                        selling price increases and the profitability of the mint and gum business also
                        contributed to the higher gross margin in 2001. The impact of these items was
                        partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to higher
                        labor rates and employee benefits costs, as well as start-up costs associated
                        with the installation of new manufacturing equipment.

                        Gross margin increased from 40.7% in 1999 to 41.5% in 2000. The
                        increase in gross margin reflected decreased costs for certain major raw
                        materials, primarily cocoa, as well as lower product returns, discounts and
                        allowances. The impact of these items was offset partially by higher absorption
                        of fixed manufacturing costs in 2000, primarily related to decreased finished
                        goods inventory levels in 2000 compared to 1999. In addition, the sales mix of
                        confectionery items sold in 2000 compared to 1999 contributed to lower
                        profitability, as the growth in sales of the more profitable standard bars was
                        outpaced by sales of packaged confectionery items. Also, higher distribution
                        and warehousing costs in 2000 reflected higher warehouse handling costs and
                        incremental costs associated with expanded warehousing capacity.

                        Gross margin in 1999 benefited .3 percentage points from the
                        inclusion in cost of sales of a one-time $12.5 million gain from revisions to
                        the Corporation's retiree medical plan, net of contributions into the Employee
                        Savings Stock Investment and Ownership Plan ("ESSIOP"). During the first
                        quarter of 1999, the Corporation changed its retiree medical plan to eliminate
                        coverage for all eligible hourly employees under age 45, to be replaced by
                        annual contributions into the ESSIOP. The change applied primarily to U.S.
                        hourly employees working in Pennsylvania. In addition, gross margin in 1999
                        would have been .3 percentage points lower if certain international distributor
                        allowances were reclassified, as discussed above for 2000.

                        In October 2001, the Corporation offered a voluntary work force
                        reduction program ("VWRP") to certain eligible employees in the United States,
                        Canada and Puerto Rico in order to reduce staffing levels and improve
                        profitability. The VWRP consisted of an early retirement program and an
                        enhanced mutual separation program. The early retirement program was offered to
                        approximately 1,200 eligible salaried employees who were born prior to January
                        1, 1954 and were employed by the Corporation prior to January 1, 1999. The
                        early retirement program provided enhanced pension, post-retirement and certain
                        supplemental benefits. The enhanced mutual separation program provided
                        increased severance and temporary medical benefits. The Corporation expects
                        that the VWRP will provide a reduction of approximately 600 employees. Most
                        employees accepting the VWRP will end their employment with the Corporation
                        during the first quarter of 2002. A total pre-tax charge of $148.7 million was
                        recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 upon employee acceptance of the VWRP.

                        year, reflecting a decrease in short-term interest expense due to a decrease in
                        average short-term borrowing rates and reduced average short-term borrowings.
                        Net interest expense for 2000 was $1.7 million above the prior year, primarily
                        as a result of higher short-term interest expense related to increased average
                        short-term borrowings and borrowing rates, and lower capitalized interest. The
                        impact of these items in 2000 was offset partially by higher interest income,
                        and lower fixed interest expense as a result of interest rate swap and forward

                        In September 2001, the Corporation completed the sale of the
                        <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business to Pharmacia Consumer Healthcare, a unit
                        of Pharmacia Corporation. Included in the sale were the trademarks and
                        manufacturing equipment for the throat drops business. Under a supply agreement
                        with Pharmacia, the Corporation agreed to manufacture <I>Luden's </I>throat
                        drops for up to 19 months after the date of sale. Under a separate services
                        agreement, the Corporation agreed to continue to sell, warehouse and distribute
                        <I>Luden's</I> throat drops through March 2002. In the third quarter of 2001,
                        the Corporation received cash proceeds of $59.9 million and recorded a gain of
                        $19.2 million before tax, $1.1 million or $.01 per share-diluted after tax, as
                        a result of the transaction. A higher gain for tax purposes primarily reflected
                        the low tax basis of the intangible assets included in the sale, resulting in
                        taxes on the gain of $18.1 million. Net sales for the <I>Luden's </I>throat
                        drops business were $10.2 million, $24.8 million and $29.7 million in 2001,
                        2000 and 1999, respectively.

                        In July 2001, the Corporation's Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do
                        Brasil, acquired the chocolate and confectionery business of Visagis for $17.1
                        million. This business had sales of approximately $20 million in 2000. Included
                        in the acquisition were the <I>IO-IO</I> brand of hazelnut creme items and the
                        chocolate and confectionery products sold under the <I>Visconti </I>brand. Also
                        included in the purchase were a manufacturing plant and confectionery equipment

                        approximately $270 million in 1999. The Corporation's results of operations for
                        2000 did not include results of the acquisition, as the transaction was
                        completed very late in the year. Had the results of the acquired businesses

                        Total assets decreased $200.3 million, or 6%, as of December 31,
                        2001, primarily as a result of lower prepaid expenses and other current assets,
                        inventories, property, plant and equipment, and intangibles resulting from
                        business acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash

                        Current assets decreased by $127.8 million, or 10%, principally
                        reflecting decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets and lower
                        inventories. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was
                        principally associated with the reclassification of gains and losses on cash
                        flow hedging derivatives to accumulated other comprehensive loss upon adoption
                        of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended, in 2001.
                        The decrease in inventories of $93.0 million primarily reflected lower raw
                        material inventories, principally cocoa beans and cocoa butter, as a result of
                        the business realignment initiatives. The increase in cash and cash equivalents
                        reflected strong cash flows during the year, commodity margin transfers and
                        increased cash resulting from the reduction of raw material inventories in
                        December under the business realignment initiatives. These increases were
                        partially offset by a $95.0 million contribution in December to one of the
                        Corporation's pension plans.

                        Property, plant and equipment was lower than the prior year
                        primarily due to depreciation expense of $153.5 million and the planned sale of
                        businesses and asset impairment write-downs of $45.3 million resulting from the
                        business realignment initiatives, partially offset by capital additions of
                        $160.1 million. The decrease in intangibles resulting from business
                        acquisitions primarily reflected the amortization of intangibles, $30.8 million
                        associated with the sale of the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business and the
                        write-down of goodwill of approximately $7.8 million associated with the
                        planned sale of businesses under the business realignment initiatives. The
                        increase in other non-current assets was primarily a result of pension plan
                        minimum liability adjustments reflecting lower asset returns and higher
                        liabilities related to the VWRP.

                        a result of a significant increase in operating cash flows in 2001. The
                        increase in accrued liabilities was primarily the result of higher accruals for
                        enhanced employee benefits and other liabilities associated with business

                        Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
                        cash generated from operations. The Corporation's income and, consequently,
                        cash provided from operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales
                        patterns, the timing of new product introductions, business acquisitions and
                        divestitures, and price increases. Chocolate, confectionery and grocery
                        seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the third
                        and fourth quarters of the year, representing the principal seasonal effect.
                        Generally, seasonal working capital needs peak during the summer months and
                        have been met by issuing commercial paper.

                        Over the past three years, cash provided from operating activities

                        expenditures and capitalized software additions by $88.4 million. Total debt,
                        including debt assumed, decreased during the period by $340.2 million,
                        reflecting reduced short-term borrowings and the repayment of long-term debt.

                        The Corporation has entered into three off-balance sheet
                        arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities.
                        The operating lease arrangements are with special purpose trusts ("SPTs")
                        whereby the Corporation leases warehouse and distribution facilities in
                        Redlands, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Hershey, Pennsylvania, as discussed
                        below. The SPTs were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent
                        leasing of the facilities to the Corporation. The SPTs financed the acquisition
                        of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent
                        third-party financial institutions. The independent third-party financial
                        institutions who hold the equity certificates are owners of the SPTs. The
                        Corporation's transactions with the SPTs are limited to the operating lease
                        agreements and the associated rent expense is included in cost of sales in the
                        Consolidated Statements of Income. The Corporation has not entered into any
                        other arrangements involving special purpose entities.

                        The leases include substantial residual guarantees by the

                        facilities at original cost. If the Corporation were to exercise its options to
                        purchase the three facilities at original cost at the end of the respective
                        initial lease terms, the Corporation could purchase the facilities for a total
                        of approximately $120.0 million, $79.9 million for the Pennsylvania and Georgia
                        facilities in 2005, and $40.1 million for the California facility in 2007.

                        In December 2000, the Corporation entered into an operating lease
                        agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in
                        Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with
                        occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement
                        contained an option for the Corporation to purchase the facility. In January
                        2002, the Corporation assigned its right to purchase the facility to an SPT
                        that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the Corporation
                        under a new operating lease agreement. The lease term is five years, with up to
                        four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The
                        cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1
                        million.

                        In July 1999, the Corporation entered into an operating lease

                        distribution facility located on land owned by the Corporation near Hershey,
                        Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor paid construction costs totaling
                        $61.7 million. The lease term is six years, including the one-year construction
                        period, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of
                        the lessor.

                        In 1999, the Corporation implemented an enterprise-wide integrated
                        information system in the United States. The first phase of system
                        implementation included new business systems and processes related to
                        purchasing, accounts payable, fixed assets, the general ledger, production
                        reporting and tracking of plant inventories. The second phase of system
                        implementation included systems and processes in the areas of sales order and
                        billing, transportation planning and management, electronic data interchange
                        communications with warehouses, finished goods inventories, accounts receivable
                        and tracking of marketing promotions. Initial implementation costs amounted to
                        approximately $101.0 million of capitalized software and hardware and $10.6
                        million of expenses. These expenditures were financed with cash provided from
                        operations and proceeds from the sale of the Corporation's pasta business.

                        In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes
                        under a November 1993 Form S-3 Registration Statement. In August 1997, the
                        Corporation filed another Form S-3 Registration Statement under which it could
                        offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $500 million of additional debt
                        securities. Also in August 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95%
                        Notes due 2012 and $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 under the November
                        1993 and August 1997 Registration Statements. Proceeds from the debt issuance
                        were used to repay a portion of the short-term borrowings associated with the
                        purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. As of December
                        31, 2001, $250 million of debt securities remained available for issuance under
                        the August 1997 Registration Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250
                        million of debt securities available under the shelf registration may be used
                        for general corporate requirements, which include reducing existing commercial
                        paper borrowings, financing capital additions and share repurchases, and
                        funding future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.

                        As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation maintained short-term and
                        long-term committed credit facilities with a syndicate of banks in the amount
                        of $400 million which could be borrowed directly or used to support the
                        issuance of commercial paper. The Corporation may increase the credit
                        facilities to $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the banks. In November 2001,
                        the short-term credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a credit
                        limit of $200 million expiring in November 2002, and the long-term committed
                        credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a $200 million credit
                        limit expiring in November 2006. The credit facilities may be used to fund
                        general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in
                        certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions. The Corporation
                        also had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks of
                        $21.7 million and $27.5 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

                        the COLI interest expense deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted
                        in the surrender of all insurance policies, thereby ending the COLI program.

                        risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements
                        and transportation costs. The Corporation does not hold or issue derivative
                        instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with
                        leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, the
                        Corporation has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability
                        of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Corporation does
                        not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

                        In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
                        issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "<I>Accounting for
                        Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities</I>" ("SFAS No. 133").
                        Subsequently, the FASB issued Statement No. 137, "<I>Accounting for Derivative
                        Instruments and Hedging Activities&#151;Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
                        Statement No. 133, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133</I>" and Statement
                        No. 138, "<I>Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
                        Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133</I>." <I></I>SFAS No. 133,
                        as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
                        derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or
                        liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that
                        changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings
                        unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for
                        qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses to offset related
                        results on the hedged item in the income statement, to the extent effective,
                        and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the
                        effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

                        SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of

                        flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive

                        swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate
                        swap agreements that effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
                        payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%.
                        As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a
                        liability of $2.7 million. The potential loss in fair value of interest rate

                        to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-domestic
                        subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate
                        movements. Foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3

                        these raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future
                        manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With

                        dairy products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures
                        contracts. At the present time, active futures contracts are not available for
                        use in pricing the Corporation's other major raw material requirements. Futures

                        sweetener, natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to

                        opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy
                        requirements. Fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price
                        fluctuations associated with the Corporation's transportation costs. The
                        Corporation's commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk
                        of future price increases, but also may potentially limit the ability to

                        The cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity
                        futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations
                        attributable to a variety of factors, including the effect of weather on crop
                        yield, other imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates,
                        political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences. Cocoa
                        prices in 2001 rebounded from the historical lows established at the end of
                        2000. Less favorable climatic conditions combined with a recovery in demand,
                        particularly in Eastern Europe, resulted in a decrease of world stocks of
                        cocoa. During 2002, a continued reduction in available cocoa stocks could
                        result in future price increases. The Corporation's costs during 2002 will not
                        necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing
                        practices, premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying
                        delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of

                        Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of

                        The following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the
                        Corporation to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent,
                        based on the Corporation's net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally
                        throughout the year. The Corporation's net commodity positions consist of the
                        excess of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts for
                        the same commodities, relating to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas,
                        fuel oil and certain dairy products. Inventories, priced forward contracts and
                        estimated anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the
                        sensitivity analysis calculations. A loss is defined, for purposes of
                        determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the
                        opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The
                        fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or
                        estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with
                        the future delivery period.

                        The decrease in fair values from 2000 to 2001 primarily reflected a

                        resulted as commodities futures required to fix the price of unpriced physical
                        forward contracts exceeded the amount of commodities futures being held at

                        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
                        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
                        management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
                        of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
                        and expenses during the period. Significant accounting policies employed by the
                        Corporation, including the use of estimates, are presented in the Notes to
                        Consolidated Financial Statements.

                        operations, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex

                        matters that are inherently uncertain. The Corporation's most critical
                        accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to accounts
                        receivable&#151;trade, accrued liabilities, and pension and other
                        post-retirement benefit plans. Actual results could differ from estimates used

                        not believe that any differences would materially affect its financial

                        potentially unsaleable products. An accrued liability for marketing promotions
                        is determined through analysis of historical trends regarding customer and
                        consumer participation in such programs, the related costs, sales and payment

                        introduction of new products, along with the impact of projected economic

                        analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales
                        patterns, and product movement at retail.

                        The Corporation's policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in

                        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and federal income tax laws,
                        respectively. Non-domestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with
                        applicable local laws and regulations. Plan assets are invested in a broadly
                        diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international common
                        stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities
                        associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial
                        calculations. These calculations are made considering payroll and employee
                        data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at
                        the date of the financial statements. The Corporation takes into consideration
                        long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest
                        rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With
                        regard to liabilities associated with post-retirement benefit plans that
                        provide health care and life insurance, the Corporation takes into
                        consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
                        the covered health care benefits.

                        The Corporation anticipates that the total U.S. confectionery
                        market will grow at a rate of two to three percent in 2002. The Corporation
                        intends to increase spending on marketing and selling programs compared to
                        2001, as the cost savings generated by the business realignment initiatives are
                        invested substantially in enhanced brand building and selling capabilities.
                        Annual savings of approximately $75 million to $80 million are anticipated when
                        the business realignment initiatives are fully implemented, with less than half
                        the estimated amount expected to be realized in 2002.

                        Variability of gross margin in future periods is affected by
                        various factors, including raw material and logistics costs, manufacturing
                        efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period. The Corporation
                        expects margin expansion in 2002, as the Corporation anticipates sales
                        increases in more profitable product lines, improved operating efficiencies
                        throughout the supply chain and the exit of certain under-performing
                        businesses. In addition, commodity costs are anticipated to be relatively
                        stable in 2002 as a result of the Corporation's forward purchasing and hedging
                        practices.

                        The Corporation intends to achieve earnings per share growth of
                        nine to eleven percent from sales volume increases in response to increased
                        spending on marketing and selling capabilities, by expanding gross margin and
                        by reducing administrative costs. As a result of the VWRP, the Corporation's
                        salaried work force will be reduced by approximately 600 employees during 2002.
                        The on-going effective income tax rate is projected to be consistent with 2001,
                        excluding one-time items.

                        requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and
                        anticipated dividend payments.

                        The Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the FASB addressed
                        several issues related to the income statement classification of certain sales
                        incentives and marketing promotion programs (see Recent Accounting
                        Pronouncements in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
                        Reclassifications made in 2002 will not affect the Corporation's financial
                        position or net income. These reclassifications will reduce the Corporation's
                        gross profit and margin, while other percent of sales measures will increase.

                        The Corporation has not fully assessed the potential impact of the
                        adoption of SFAS No. 142 (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the
                        Consolidated Financial Statements). However, it is estimated that earnings per
                        share-diluted will increase by approximately $.10 in 2002 as substantially all
                        amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets will be eliminated. The
                        Corporation's growth goal for earnings per share of nine to eleven percent does
                        not include the impact of changes to accounting methods to be implemented in
                        2002.

                        The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1,
                        2001. SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of the gain

                        hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
                        be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
                        transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative
                        instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. All derivative

                        Intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions principally
                        consist of the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net
                        assets of businesses acquired (goodwill). Goodwill was $388.7 million and
                        $431.8 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in
                        goodwill primarily reflected the disposition of the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops
                        business in September 2001 and the impact of product line rationalization
                        decisions, including the planned sale of certain businesses, as part of the
                        Corporation's business realignment initiatives recorded in the fourth quarter
                        of 2001. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Other
                        intangible assets were $40.4 million and $42.6 million as of December 31, 2001
                        and 2000, respectively. Other intangible assets are amortized on a
                        straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives, up to 40 years.
                        The Corporation periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have
                        occurred indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible
                        assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that goodwill should be
                        evaluated for possible impairment, the Corporation uses an estimate of the
                        acquired business' undiscounted future cash flows compared to the related
                        carrying amount of net assets, including goodwill, to determine if an
                        impairment loss should be recognized. When factors indicate that other
                        intangible assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Corporation
                        uses an estimate of the associated undiscounted future cash flows compared to
                        the related carrying amount of assets to determine if an impairment loss should
                        be recognized.

                        In September 2001, the Corporation completed the sale of the
                        <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business to Pharmacia Consumer Healthcare, a unit
                        of Pharmacia Corporation. Included in the sale were the trademarks and
                        manufacturing equipment for the throat drops business. Under a supply agreement
                        with Pharmacia, the Corporation agreed to manufacture <I>Luden's </I>throat
                        drops for up to 19 months after the date of sale. Under a separate services
                        agreement, the Corporation agreed to continue to sell, warehouse and distribute
                        <I>Luden's</I> throat drops through March 2002. In the third quarter of 2001,
                        the Corporation received cash proceeds of $59.9 million and recorded a gain of
                        $19.2 million before tax, $1.1 million or $.01 per share-diluted after tax, as
                        a result of the transaction. A higher gain for tax purposes reflected the low
                        tax basis of the intangible assets included in the sale, resulting in taxes on
                        the gain of $18.1 million. Net sales for the <I>Luden's </I>throat drops
                        business were $10.2 million, $24.8 million and $29.7 million in 2001, 2000 and
                        1999, respectively.

                        In January 1999, the Corporation completed the sale of a 94%
                        majority interest of its U.S. pasta business to New World Pasta, LLC. The
                        transaction included the <I>American Beauty, Ideal by San Giorgio, Light `n

                        brands, along with six manufacturing plants. In the first quarter of 1999, the
                        Corporation received cash proceeds of $450.0 million, retained a 6% minority
                        interest and recorded a gain of approximately $243.8 million before tax, $165.0
                        million or $1.17 per share-diluted after tax, as a result of the transaction.
                        Net sales for the pasta business were $29.3 million and net income was $1.5

                        In late October 2001, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved
                        a plan to improve the efficiency and profitability of the Corporation's
                        operations. The plan included asset management improvements, product line
                        rationalization, supply chain efficiency improvements and a voluntary work
                        force reduction program. The major components of the plan will be completed by
                        the fourth quarter of 2002.

                        During the fourth quarter of 2001, a charge to cost of sales and a
                        business realignment and asset impairment charge were recorded totaling $278.4
                        million before tax ($171.9 million after tax or $1.25 per share-diluted). The
                        total charges included a charge to cost of sales of $50.1 million associated
                        with raw material inventory reductions and a business realignment and asset
                        impairment charge of $228.3 million (collectively, "the business realignment
                        initiatives"). Components of the $228.3 million pre-tax charge included $5.3
                        million relating to asset management improvements, $28.3 million relating to
                        product line rationalization, $46.0 million relating to supply chain efficiency
                        improvements and $148.7 million relating to a voluntary work force reduction
                        program. These initiatives are expected to generate $75 million to $80 million
                        of annual savings when fully implemented, with less than half the estimated
                        amount expected to be realized in 2002. Additional charges totaling
                        approximately $31.6 million before tax, or $.14 per share-diluted, are expected
                        to be recorded in 2002, as incurred, primarily related to pension settlement
                        costs resulting from the voluntary work force reduction program and expenses
                        associated with the relocation of manufacturing equipment.

                        The charge to cost of sales of $50.1 million was a result of
                        decisions to outsource the manufacture of certain ingredients and to
                        significantly reduce the inventory levels of certain raw materials,

                        almonds and peanuts. The Corporation sold raw material inventories and delayed
                        raw material deliveries during the fourth quarter. A pre-tax charge of $5.3
                        million was also recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the pre-tax
                        business realignment and asset impairments charge. This charge reflected the
                        write-off of manufacturing machinery and equipment as a result of the
                        ingredients manufacturing outsourcing.

                        products and the realignment of the Corporation's domestic and international
                        sales organizations. The estimated loss on the sale or exit of these businesses
                        was $26.4 million as of December 31, 2001, net of estimated sales proceeds. Net
                        sales associated with these businesses were approximately $38.0 million, $43.1
                        million and $45.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Costs
                        associated with the realignment of the sales organizations totaled $1.9
                        million, primarily related to sales office closings and terminating the use of

                        will be closed. A net pre-tax charge of $46.0 million was recorded in the
                        fourth quarter of 2001 relating to the closure of these facilities. A
                        manufacturing facility in Denver, Colorado will be closed, with manufacturing
                        equipment and machinery to be sold or relocated for production at a contract
                        manufacturer. The Denver, Colorado plant principally manufactures <I>Jolly

                   <P>
                        In October 2001, the Corporation offered a voluntary work force
                        reduction program ("VWRP") to certain eligible employees in the United States,
                        Canada and Puerto Rico in order to reduce staffing levels and improve
                        profitability. The VWRP consisted of an early retirement program and an
                        enhanced mutual separation program. The early retirement program was offered to
                        approximately 1,200 eligible salaried employees who were born prior to January
                        1, 1954 and were employed by the Corporation prior to January 1, 1999. The
                        early retirement program provided enhanced pension, post-retirement and certain
                        supplemental benefits. The enhanced mutual separation program provided
                        increased severance and temporary medical benefits. The Corporation expects
                        that the VWRP will provide a reduction of approximately 600 employees. Most
                        employees accepting the VWRP will end their employment with the Corporation
                        during the first quarter of 2002. A total pre-tax charge of $148.7 million was
                        recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 upon employee acceptance of the VWRP.
                        The charge primarily reflected enhanced retirement and separation benefits.

                        The operating lease arrangements are with special purpose trusts ("SPTs")
                        whereby the Corporation leases warehouse and distribution facilities in
                        Redlands, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Hershey, Pennsylvania, as discussed
                        below. The SPTs were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent
                        leasing of the facilities to the Corporation. The SPTs financed the acquisition
                        of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent
                        third-party financial institutions. The independent third-party financial
                        institutions who hold the equity certificates are owners of the SPTs. The
                        Corporation's transactions with the SPTs are limited to the operating lease
                        agreements and the associated rent expense is included in cost of sales in the
                        Consolidated Statements of Income. The Corporation has not entered into any

                        agreement with an SPT for the construction and leasing of a warehouse and
                        distribution facility located on land owned by the Corporation near Hershey,
                        Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor paid construction costs totaling
                        $61.7 million. The lease term is six years, including the one-year construction
                        period, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of
                        the lessor.

                        The Corporation utilizes certain derivative instruments, from time
                        to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange
                        contracts and commodities futures contracts, to manage variability in cash
                        flows associated with interest rate, currency exchange rate and commodity
                        market price risk exposures. The interest rate swaps and foreign currency
                        contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying
                        exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures.
                        Commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are
                        intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated
                        with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation
                        costs. If it is probable that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur
                        either by the end of the originally specified time period or within an
                        additional two-month period of time, derivative gains and losses reported in
                        accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are
                        immediately reclassified into earnings. Gains and losses on terminated
                        derivatives designated as hedges are accounted for as part of the originally
                        hedged transaction. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges of
                        items that mature or are sold or terminated, are recognized in income in the
                        same period as the originally hedged transaction was anticipated to affect
                        earnings. The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments as cash flow hedges
                        and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. In
                        entering into these contracts, the Corporation has assumed the risk that might
                        arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
                        contracts. The Corporation does not expect any losses as a result of
                        counterparty defaults.

                   <P>
                        In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest
                        rate exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
                        swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate
                        swap agreements that effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
                        payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate. Rental
                        payments on operating leases associated with the financing of construction of a
                        warehouse and distribution facility near Hershey, Pennsylvania for $61.7
                        million and the financing of the purchase of a warehouse and distribution
                        facility near Atlanta, Georgia for $18.2 million are variable based on the
                        London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). Such contingent operating lease rental
                        payments are forecasted transactions as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended.
                        The interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the
                        interest-rate-contingent rental payments on the operating leases from LIBOR to
                        a fixed rate of 6.1%. The interest rate swap agreements qualify as cash flow
                        hedges and the notional amounts, interest rates and terms of the swap
                        agreements are consistent with the underlying operating lease agreements they
                        are intended to hedge and, therefore, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Gains
                        and losses on the interest rate swap agreements are included in other
                        comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales as part of shipping
                        and distribution expense in the same period as the hedged rental payments
                        affect earnings.

                   <P>
                        The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was determined
                        based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial
                        instruments and was included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other
                        long-term liabilities, with the offset reflected in accumulated other
                        comprehensive loss, net of income taxes. Cash flows from interest rate swap
                        agreements are classified as net cash provided from operating activities on the
                        Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Corporation's risk related to the
                        interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the
                        agreements at prevailing market rates.

                        reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. Foreign currency price risks

                        foreign currency denomination of the transactions, foreign currency derivatives
                        are highly effective in hedging cash flows related to transactions denominated
                        in the corresponding foreign currencies. These contracts meet the criteria for
                        cash flow hedge accounting treatment and, accordingly, gains and losses are
                        included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales or
                        selling, marketing and administrative expense in the same period that the
                        hedged items affect earnings. In entering into these contracts the Corporation
                        has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of
                        counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Corporation does not

                        The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was estimated

                        associated with the purchase of equipment are classified as net cash flows

                        commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of
                        price fluctuations. Commodity price risks are hedged generally for periods from

                        accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses are included

                        In order to qualify as a hedge of commodity price risk, it must be
                        demonstrated that the changes in fair value of the commodities futures
                        contracts are highly effective in hedging price risks associated with commodity
                        purchases for manufacturing requirements and with transportation costs. The
                        assessment of hedge effectiveness for commodities futures is performed on a
                        quarterly basis by calculating the change in switch values relative to open
                        commodities futures contracts being held and the number of futures contracts
                        needed to price raw material purchases for anticipated manufacturing
                        requirements and to hedge transportation costs. Effectiveness is also monitored
                        by tracking changes in basis differentials as discussed below. The prices of
                        commodities futures contracts reflect delivery to the same locations where the
                        Corporation takes delivery of the physical commodities and, therefore, there is
                        no ineffectiveness resulting from differences in location between the
                        derivative and the hedged item. Commodities futures contracts have been deemed
                        to be highly effective in hedging price risks associated with corresponding raw
                        material purchases for manufacturing requirements and transportation costs.

                        Because of the rollover strategy used for commodities futures
                        contracts, which is required by futures market conditions, some ineffectiveness
                        may result in hedging forecasted manufacturing requirements as futures
                        contracts are switched from nearby contract positions to contract positions
                        which are required to fix the price of raw material purchases for manufacturing
                        requirements. Hedge ineffectiveness may also result from variability in basis
                        differentials associated with the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing

                        Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of

                        value of futures contracts (unrealized gains and losses) are made on a daily
                        basis and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income
                        taxes, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such cash transfers will be offset
                        by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw

                        flows from commodities futures contracts are classified as net cash provided

                        manufacturing requirements for each commodity. Physical commodity forward
                        purchase contracts meet the SFAS No. 133 definition of "normal purchases and

                        approximately $1.7 million before tax for the year ended December 31, 2001. No
                        gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from
                        accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income as a result of the
                        discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted
                        transaction would not occur. There were no components of gains or losses on
                        cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such

                        In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest
                        rate exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
                        swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate
                        swap agreements that effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
                        payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%.
                        As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a
                        liability of $2.7 million.

                   <P>
                        Generally, the Corporation's short-term borrowings are in the form
                        of commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or
                        less. As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation maintained short-term and
                        long-term committed credit facilities with a syndicate of banks in the amount
                        of $400 million which could be borrowed directly or used to support the
                        issuance of commercial paper. The Corporation may increase the credit
                        facilities to $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the banks. In November 2001,
                        the short-term credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a credit
                        limit of $200 million expiring in November 2002, and the long-term committed
                        credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a credit limit of $200
                        million expiring in November 2006. The credit facilities may be used to fund
                        general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in
                        certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions.

                   <P>
                        The Corporation also maintains lines of credit with domestic and
                        international commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various
                        currencies up to approximately $21.7 million and $27.5 million as of December
                        31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, at the lending banks' prime commercial
                        interest rates or lower.

                        The Corporation had short-term foreign bank loans against its
                        credit facilities and lines of credit of $7.0 million as of December 31, 2001,
                        and combined domestic commercial paper borrowings and short-term foreign bank
                        loans of $257.6 million as of December 31, 2000. The amount of the
                        Corporation's short-term borrowings peaked in August 2001 at $304.7 million.
                        The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding as of
                        December 31, 2001 and 2000, were 0.2% and 6.4%, respectively.

                   <P>
                        The credit facilities and lines of credit were supported by
                        commitment fee arrangements. The average fee during 2001 was less than .2% per
                        annum of the commitment. The Corporation's credit facility agreements contain a
                        financial covenant which requires that a specified income to interest ratio be
                        maintained. These agreements are also subject to other representations and
                        covenants which do not materially restrict the Corporation's activities. The
                        Corporation is in compliance with all covenants included in the credit facility
                        agreements. There were no significant compensating balance agreements which
                        legally restricted these funds.

                   <P>
                        As a result of maintaining a consolidated cash management system,
                        the Corporation maintains overdraft positions at certain banks. Such
                        overdrafts, which were reflected as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents,
                        were $26.5 million and $22.5 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
                        respectively.

                        associated with its Corporate Owned Life Insurance ("COLI") program. The
                        resulting Closing Agreement with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense
                        deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted in the surrender of all
                        insurance policies, thereby ending the COLI program. The settlement reflected
                        the complete resolution of all federal and state tax aspects of the program.

                        In February 2001, the Corporation made a $75.0 million contribution
                        to its domestic pension plans to improve the funded status. In December 2001,
                        the Corporation made a $95.0 million contribution to one of its domestic
                        pension plans to fund anticipated payments related to the early retirement
                        program.

                        in December 2000, included its Hourly Pension Plan for employees at the Las
                        Piedras, Puerto Rico manufacturing plant. Salaried employees at the plant were
                        covered by the Hershey Foods Corporation Retirement Plan as of December 31,
                        2000, for services subsequent to the date of acquisition.

                        An unrecognized net actuarial loss for pension benefits in 2001,
                        compared with the unrecognized net actuarial gain for pension benefits in 2000,
                        was due primarily to the actual return on plan assets being less than the
                        expected return and a lower discount rate in 2001.

                        As of December 31, 2001, for pension plans with accumulated benefit
                        obligations in excess of plan assets, the related projected benefit obligation,
                        accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets were $794.3
                        million, $750.9 million and $657.3 million, respectively. Included in the
                        projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation amounts, were
                        $41.6 million and $40.4 million, respectively, for an unfunded supplemental
                        executive retirement program, which is a non-qualified plan that provides
                        certain senior executive officers defined pension benefits based on their total
                        compensation. As of December 31, 2000, for pension plans with accumulated
                        benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the related projected benefit
                        obligation and accumulated benefit obligation were $36.5 million and $34.9
                        million, respectively, with no plan assets, primarily associated with the
                        supplemental executive retirement program.

                        A minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the
                        actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits exceeds plan assets and
                        accrued pension liabilities. In 2001, a minimum liability adjustment of $57.1
                        million, net of a deferred tax benefit of $22.9 million, was recorded as a
                        component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reported in accumulated
                        other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity. In 2000, a
                        minimum liability adjustment of $1.5 million, net of a deferred tax benefit of
                        $.6 million, was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)
                        and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of
                        stockholders' equity.

                        The Corporation has two post-retirement benefit plans. The health
                        care plan is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually,
                        and the life insurance plan is non-contributory.

                        In conjunction with the business realignment initiatives announced
                        on October 24, 2001, the Corporation offered an early retirement program to
                        approximately 10% of its work force in the fourth quarter of 2001. The early
                        retirement program gave eligible salaried employees an opportunity to retire
                        with enhanced benefits related to the Corporation's pension and other
                        post-retirement benefit plans. In general, eligible employees were born before
                        January 1, 1954 and were hired before January 1, 1999. Pension benefits were
                        enhanced by adding five additional years of age and service to eligible
                        employees' retirement accounts, along with certain supplemental benefits.
                        Retiree medical benefits were enhanced by adding five additional years to age
                        and service formulas used to determine retiree contributions.

                        The total pre-tax charge for the VWRP recorded in the fourth
                        quarter was $148.7 million and was accrued based on actual employee
                        acceptances. Improved pension benefits under the early retirement program of
                        $109.1 million will be funded through payments from one of the Corporation's
                        defined benefit pension plans. Enhanced retiree medical benefits of $30.8
                        million will be funded from operating cash flows. Additional costs for
                        outplacement services and enhanced severance benefits under a voluntary mutual
                        separation program of $8.8 million will also be funded from operating cash
                        flows. In addition, the Corporation expects to record a non-cash pre-tax charge
                        of approximately $20.2 million in 2002, related to pension settlement costs
                        associated with the early retirement program.

                        The Corporation's employee stock ownership trust ("ESOP") serves as
                        the primary vehicle for contributions to its existing Employee Savings Stock
                        Investment and Ownership Plan for participating domestic salaried and hourly
                        employees. The ESOP was funded by a 15-year 7.75% loan of $47.9 million from
                        the Corporation. During 2001 and 2000, the ESOP received a combination of
                        dividends on unallocated shares and contributions from the Corporation equal to
                        the amount required to meet its principal and interest payments under the loan.
                        Simultaneously, the ESOP allocated to participants 159,176 shares of Common
                        Stock each year. As of December 31, 2001, the ESOP held 1,139,966 allocated
                        shares and 795,872 unallocated shares. All ESOP shares are considered
                        outstanding for income per share computations.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        The Corporation recognized net compensation expense equal to the
                        shares allocated multiplied by the original cost of $20.06 per share less
                        dividends received by the ESOP on unallocated shares. Compensation expense
                        related to the ESOP for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1.6 million, $3.2 million and
                        $1.6 million, respectively. Dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares for 2001,
                        2000 and 1999 were $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
                        Dividends paid on all ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction to retained
                        earnings. The unearned ESOP compensation balance in stockholders' equity
                        represented deferred compensation expense to be recognized by the Corporation
                        in future years as additional shares are allocated to participants.

                        adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ("Rights Agreement") and
                        declared a dividend of one right ("Right") for each outstanding share of Common
                        Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of
                        business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or
                        receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not
                        affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the

                        million and 5.5 million stock options, respectively, were not included in the
                        diluted earnings per share calculation because the exercise price was higher
                        than the average market price of the Common Stock for the year and, therefore,
                        the effect would have been antidilutive.

                   <P>
                        The long-term portion of the Key Employee Incentive Plan
                        ("Incentive Plan"), provides for grants of stock-based compensation awards to
                        senior executives and key employees of one or more of the following:
                        non-qualified stock options ("fixed stock options"), performance stock units,
                        stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units. The Incentive Plan also
                        provides for the deferral of performance stock unit and restricted stock unit
                        awards by participants. As of December 31, 2001, 13.0 million shares (inclusive
                        of adjustments for stock splits) were authorized and approved by the
                        Corporation's stockholders for grants under the long-term portion of the
                        Incentive Plan. In 2002, the Corporation's Board of Directors amended the
                        Incentive Plan to increase by 6.0 million the number of shares available for
                        grants under the long-term portion of the Incentive Plan.

                   <P>
                        In 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a
                        world-wide, broad-based employee stock option program, called HSY Growth. HSY
                        Growth provides all eligible employees with a one-time grant of 100
                        non-qualified stock options. Under HSY Growth, over 1.2 million options were
                        granted on January 7, 1997.
                   </P>
                   <P>
                        The Corporation applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

                        in accounting for the Incentive Plan and HSY Growth. Accordingly, no
                        compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option grants. Had
                        compensation cost for the Corporation's stock-based compensation plans been
                        determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under the
                        Incentive Plan and HSY Growth consistent with the method of Statement of
                        Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "<I>Accounting for Stock-Based

                        The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
                        grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
                        weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
                        respectively: dividend yields of 2.2%, 1.8% and 1.4%, expected volatility of
                        28%, 27% and 23%, risk-free interest rates of 5.0%, 6.7% and 4.9%, and expected
                        lives of 6.4 years, 6.5 years and 6.5 years.

                        The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the
                        Corporation's Common Stock on the date of grant. Each option has a maximum term
                        of ten years. Options granted under the Incentive Plan prior to December 31,
                        1999, vest at the end of the second year after grant. In 2000, the terms and
                        conditions of the grant were changed to provide for pro-rated vesting over four
                        years for options granted subsequent to December 31, 1999. Options granted
                        under the HSY Growth program have a term of ten years and vested on January 7,
                        2002.

                        In the normal course of business, the Corporation extends credit to
                        customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. The Corporation believes
                        that it has little concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of its

                        accounted for approximately 15% of the Corporation's total accounts receivable.
                        As of December 31, 2001, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of the

                        Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts
                        of $16.0 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

                        contracts entered into to manage price risks related to the purchase of raw
                        materials and energy for manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation
                        costs. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001, the
                        impact of hedging transactions was reclassified to accumulated other

                   <P>
                        The Corporation operates in a single consumer foods line of
                        business, encompassing the manufacture, distribution and sale of confectionery
                        and grocery products. Consolidated net sales represented primarily sales of
                        confectionery products. The Corporation's principal operations and markets are
                        located in the United States. The Corporation also manufactures, markets, sells
                        and distributes confectionery and grocery products in Canada and Mexico,

                        Net sales and long-lived assets of businesses outside of the United
                        States were not significant. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries
                        exceeded 10% of total net sales and amounted to approximately $819.8 million,
                        $710.9 million and $605.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

                        Hershey Foods Corporation is responsible for the financial
                        statements and other financial information contained in this report. The
                        Corporation believes that the financial statements have been prepared in
                        conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
                        appropriate under the circumstances to reflect in all material respects the
                        substance of applicable events and transactions. In preparing the financial
                        statements, it is necessary that management make informed estimates and
                        judgments. The other financial information in this annual report is consistent
                        with the financial statements.

                        The Corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls
                        designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable
                        for purposes of preparing financial statements and that assets are properly
                        accounted for and safeguarded. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on
                        the recognition that the cost of the system must be related to the benefits to
                        be derived. The Corporation believes its system provides an appropriate balance
                        in this regard. The Corporation maintains an Internal Audit Department which
                        reviews the adequacy and tests the application of internal accounting controls.

                        The financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP,
                        independent public accountants, whose appointment was ratified by stockholder
                        vote at the stockholders' meeting held on April 24, 2001. Their report
                        expresses an opinion that the Corporation's financial statements are fairly
                        stated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
                        United States, and they have indicated to us that their audit was performed in
                        accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
                        which are designed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
                        statements are free of material misstatement.

                        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
                        Hershey Foods Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of
                        December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income,
                        cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period
                        ended December 31, 2001, appearing on pages A-16 through A-43. These financial
                        statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our

                   <P>
                        We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
                        generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan
                        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
                        financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
                        examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
                        the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
                        principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
                        evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
                        audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
                        fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hershey Foods
                        Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results
                        of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
                        period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
                        generally accepted in the United States.

                        site also provides analyst presentations and audio archives of conference calls
                        and analyst group presentations for those interested in a more in-depth review

       <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
            Hershey Foods Corporation (the "Corporation") hereby establishes the Key
            Employee Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to provide to
            selected key employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries (as defined
            below), upon whose efforts the Corporation is dependent for the successful
            conduct of its business, further incentive to continue and increase their
            efforts as employees and to remain in the employ of the Corporation and its
            subsidiaries.
       </P>
       <P ALIGN="justify">
            The Plan continues the Annual Incentive Program ("AIP"), with certain
            modifications, as in effect under the Corporation's Management Incentive Plan
            ("MIP") established in 1975 and as amended thereafter, pursuant to which
            participants are entitled to receive cash awards based on achievement of
            performance goals during annual performance cycles. The Plan also continues the
            Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP") portion of the MIP with certain
            modifications. In addition to performance stock units ("Performance Stock
            Units"), the LTIP portion also includes nonqualified stock options for the
            purchase of Common Stock ("Options"); stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); and
            restricted stock units ("Restricted Stock Units").

            1986 (the "Code"), and (ii) the term "Corporation" defined above shall refer

            the meaning of Rule 16b-3 or its successor under the Securities Exchange Act of
            1934 (the "Exchange Act") and an "outside director" within the meaning of

            previously appointed and may fill vacancies, however caused, in the Committee.
            The Committee may adopt such rules and regulations as it deems useful in
            governing its affairs. To the extent provided by resolution of the Board, the
            Committee may authorize the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and
            other senior officers of the Corporation to designate officers and employees to
            be recipients of awards, to determine the terms, conditions, form and amount of
            any such awards, and to take such other actions which the Committee is
            authorized to take under this Plan, provided that the Committee may not

            subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or are "covered employees" as defined
            in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any action of the Committee with respect to the
            administration of the Plan shall be taken by majority vote at a Committee

       <P ALIGN="justify">
            Without limiting the type or number of awards that may be made under this
            Plan, an award may be in the form of a performance-based award intended to
            comply as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code
            (such award a "Performance Award"). A Performance Award shall be paid, vested
            or otherwise deliverable solely on account of the attainment of one or more
            pre-established, objective performance goals ("Performance Goals") established
            by the Committee prior to the earlier to occur of (x) 90 days after the
            commencement of the period of service to which the Performance Goal relates and
            (y) the elapse of 25% of the period of service (as established in good faith at
            the time the Performance Goal is established), and in any event while the
            outcome is substantially uncertain. A Performance Goal is objective if a third
            party having knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether the goal
            is met. A Performance Goal may be based on one or more of the following
            business criteria: earnings per share, return on net assets, market share,
            control of costs, net sales, cash flow, return on invested capital, economic
            value-added measures, sales growth, earnings growth, stock price, return on
            equity, financial ratings, regulatory compliance, achievement of balance sheet
            or income statement objectives, or other financial, accounting or quantitative
            objectives established by the Committee (collectively, the "Performance
            Factors"). Performance Factors may be particular to a participant or the
            division, line of business or other unit in which the participant works, or the
            Corporation generally, or may be absolute in their terms or measured against or
            in relationship to the performance of a peer group or other external or
            internal measure. A Performance Goal may, but need not be, based upon a change
            or an increase or positive result under a particular Performance Factor and
            could include, for example, maintaining the status quo, limiting economic
            losses, or a relative comparison of performance to the performance of a peer
            group or other external or internal measure (measured, in each case, by
            reference to specific Performance Factors). A Performance Goal may include or
            exclude items to measure specific objectives, including, without limitation,
            extraordinary or other non-recurring items, acquisitions and divestitures,
            internal restructuring and reorganizations, accounting charges and effects of
            accounting changes. In interpreting Plan provisions applicable to Performance
            Goals and Performance Awards applicable to awards to employees who are "covered
            employees" under Section 162(m) of the Code, it is the intent of the Plan to
            conform with the standards of Section 162(m) of the Code and Treasury
            Regulations Section 1.162-27(e)(2)(i), and the Committee in establishing such
            goals and interpreting the Plan shall be guided by such provisions. Prior to
            the payment of any compensation based on the achievement of Performance Goals
            to any such "covered employee", the Committee must certify in writing that
            applicable Performance Goals and any of the material terms thereof were, in
            fact, satisfied. Subject to the foregoing provisions, the terms, conditions and
            limitations applicable to any Performance Awards made pursuant to this Plan
            shall be determined by the Committee.

            Plan and Paragraph 8 (a) of the Plan may not be amended in any manner that
            would adversely affect any participant without the consent of the participant.
