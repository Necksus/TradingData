SOLICITATION

          The Proxy  accompanying this Proxy Statement is solicited on behalf of
the Board of Directors of ALLETE, Inc. (ALLETE) for use at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders  to be held on May 14,  2002  and  any  adjournments  thereof.  The
purpose  of the  meeting  is to elect a Board of 11  directors  to serve for the
ensuing  year,  to approve  the  appointment  of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP as
ALLETE's  independent  auditors  for  2002, to  approve  the  reservation  of an
additional  three  million  shares of ALLETE  Common  Stock  (Common  Stock) for
issuance  under  the  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan and to
transact  such other  business  as may  properly  come before the  meeting.  All
properly  submitted  proxies  received at or before the meeting and  entitled to
vote will be voted at the meeting.

          This Proxy  Statement and the enclosed Proxy Card were first mailed on
or about March 26, 2002. Each Proxy delivered  pursuant to this  solicitation is
revocable  any time  before  it is  voted by  written  notice  delivered  to the
Secretary of ALLETE.

          ALLETE expects to solicit proxies primarily by mail.  Proxies also may
be  solicited  in person and by  telephone  at a nominal  cost by  employees  or
retirees of ALLETE.  The expenses of such  solicitation are the ordinary ones in
connection with preparing, assembling and mailing the material, and also include
charges and  expenses of brokerage  houses and other  custodians,  nominees   or
other fiduciaries for communicating with shareholders.  Additional  solicitation
of  proxies  will  be  made  by  mail,  telephone  and in  person  by  Georgeson
Shareholder,  a firm  specializing in the solicitation of proxies,  at a cost to
ALLETE of  approximately  $5,500 plus  expenses.  The total amount of such costs
will be borne by ALLETE.

OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING PROCEDURES

          The outstanding shares of capital stock of ALLETE as of March 15, 2002
were 84,663,447 shares of Common Stock (without par value).

          Each share of the Common Stock of record on the books of ALLETE at the
close of business on March 15, 2002 is entitled to notice of the Annual  Meeting
and to one vote.

          The affirmative  vote of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to
vote at the Annual  Meeting is required  for  election of each director, and the
affirmative  vote of a majority of the shares of stock  present and  entitled to
vote is  required  for  approval  of the other  items  described  in this  Proxy
Statement to be acted upon by shareholders.  An automated system administered by
Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,  N.A. tabulates the votes.  Abstentions are included
in determining the number of shares present and voting, and are treated as votes
against the particular proposal. Broker non-votes are not counted for or against
any proposal.

          Unless contrary  instructions  are indicated on the Proxy,  all shares
represented  by valid  proxies  will be voted "FOR" the election of all nominees
for director  named  herein,  "FOR"  approval of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP as
ALLETE's independent  auditors for 2002  and  "FOR"  approval of the reservation
of an  additional  three million  shares of Common Stock for issuance  under the
Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan.  If any other  business  is
transacted at the meeting, all shares represented by valid proxies will be voted
in accordance with the best judgment of the appointed Proxies.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

          Section  16(a) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended,
requires  ALLETE's  directors and executive  officers,  and persons who own more
than 10 percent of a registered  class of ALLETE's  equity  securities,  to file
reports of initial  ownership of Common Stock and other  equity  securities  and
subsequent changes in that ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the New York  Stock  Exchange.  Based on a review  of such  reports,  ALLETE
believes that all such filing  requirements were met during 2001, except for one
report  covering  the purchase of 1,000 shares of Common Stock by Mr. Nick Smith
which was inadvertently filed three months late.

                       ITEM NO. 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is intended that the shares represented by the Proxy will be voted,
unless authority is withheld, "FOR" the election of the 11 nominees for director
named on the opposite page.  Pictured below, Mr. Sandbulte,  Director since 1983
and former  Chairman,  President  and CEO, will not stand for election this year
since he will retire from the Board pursuant to the Board's  retirement  policy.
Directors  are elected to serve until the next annual  election of directors and
until a  successor  is  elected  and  qualified, or until a  director's  earlier
resignation or removal. In the event that any nominee should become unavailable,
which is not anticipated, the Board of Directors may provide by resolution for a
lesser number of directors, or designate substitute  nominees, who would receive
the votes represented by the enclosed Proxy.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS IN 2001

          During 2001 the Board of Directors held nine  meetings.  The Executive
Committee, which held nine meetings during 2001, provides oversight of corporate
financial matters,  performs the functions of a director  nominating  committee,
leads the Board's  annual  evaluation  of the Chief  Executive  Officer   and is
authorized  to exercise  the  authority  of the Board in the  intervals  between
meetings.  Shareholders  may  recommend  nominees for director to the  Executive
Committee by  addressing  the  Secretary  of ALLETE,  30 West  Superior  Street,
Duluth, Minnesota 55802. The Audit Committee, which held eight meetings in 2001,
recommends the selection of independent auditors, reviews and evaluates ALLETE's
accounting  practices,  reviews periodic financial reports to be provided to the
public,  and reviews and  recommends  approval of the annual audit  report.  The
Executive Compensation Committee,  which held five meetings in 2001, establishes
compensation  and  benefit  arrangements  for  ALLETE  officers  and  other  key
executives that are intended to be equitable,  competitive  with the marketplace
and consistent with corporate  objectives.  All directors attended 75 percent or
more  of the  aggregate  number  of  meetings  of the  Board  of  Directors  and
applicable committee meetings in 2001.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

          Employee  directors  receive  no  additional  compensation  for  their
services as directors.  In 2001 ALLETE paid each non-employee director an annual
retainer  fee of $5,000 and 1,300  shares of Common Stock under the terms of the
Director Stock Plan. In addition, each non-employee director was paid $1,100 for
each Board,  committee and subsidiary board meeting  attended,  except that $500
was  paid  for  attendance  at a second  meeting  held  the same day as  another
meeting.  Each non-employee director who is the chairman of a committee received
an additional $200 for each committee meeting attended.  A $250 fee was paid for
all conference call meetings.  Directors may elect to defer all or a part of the
cash portion of their retainer and meeting fees. The shares of Common Stock paid
to  directors  with  respect to 2001 had an average  market  price of $22.17 per
share.  The Board  authorized  payment of $25,000  each to  Directors  Evans and
Smith, and $10,000 to Director Stender for  responsibilities  undertaken  during
the  retirement of Mr.  Russell and the election of Mr.  Gartzke as President of
ALLETE in 2001.

          Under  the  Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive  Plan,  non-employee
directors  receive  automatic  grants  of 1,500  stock  options  every  year and
performance shares valued at $10,000 every other year. The stock options vest 50
percent after the first year, the remaining 50 percent after the second year and
expire on the tenth  anniversary  of the date of grant.  The exercise  price for
each  grant is the  closing  sale  price of ALLETE  Common  Stock on the date of
grant. The performance  periods for performance shares end on December 31 of the
year following the date of grant. Dividend equivalents in the form of additional
performance shares accrue during the performance period and are paid only to the
extent the underlying grant is earned.  The performance goal of each performance
period is based on Total  Shareholder  Return for ALLETE in  comparison to Total
Shareholder Return for 16 diversified electric utilities.  Any awards earned are
paid out in Common Stock. During the two-year performance period ending December
31, 2001,  shareholders  of ALLETE  realized  Total  Shareholder  Return of 64.3
percent on their  investment in Common Stock,  ranking ALLETE third among the 16
diversified  utilities.  With this ranking under the plan,  the  directors  each
earned  1,358  shares of Common  Stock,  an award  equal to 200 percent of their
target  performance  share award.  Fifty percent of this performance share award
was paid in stock at the end of the performance period. The remaining 50 percent
will be paid in stock on the  first  anniversary  of the end of the  performance
period.

<F1> Options vest 50 percent on January 2, 2002 and 50 percent  on January 2, 2003.  Options  granted  to  each  of  the  executives
     listed in this  table  except  Mr.  Shippar  include a  replacement  option  feature  and are  subject  to a  change-in-control
     acceleration  provision.  Replacement  options (also known as ownership  retention  options or reload  options) are intended to
     encourage share ownership.  They typically do not provide stock appreciation  opportunity greater than the original options. In
     addition, they do not result in an increase in equity position,  which is the total combined number of shares and options held.
     Replacement  options are granted when the  executive  uses  his  shares of  Common Stock to fund the  exercise  price  of stock
     options. One replacement option is granted to replace each share that is delivered by the executive as payment for the purchase
     price of shares being acquired through the exercise of a stock option.  Replacement  options become exercisable 12 months after
     their grant date and  terminate on the  expiration  date of the option that they  replace.  The exercise  price of  replacement
     options is equal to the closing price of ALLETE's Common Stock on the grant date of the replacement options.
<F2> The grant date dollar value of options is based  on  ALLETE's  binomial  ratio (as of  January 2, 2001) of  .228.  The binomial
     method is a complicated mathematical formula premised on immediate exercisability and transferability of the options, which are
     not features of ALLETE's options granted to executive officers and other employees. The values shown are theoretical and do not
     necessarily reflect the actual values the recipients may eventually realize.  Any actual value to the officer or other employee
     will depend on the extent to which the market value of ALLETE's  Common Stock at a future date exceeds the exercise  price.  In
     addition to the option exercise price,  the following  assumptions for modeling were used to calculate the values shown for the
     options granted in 2001: (i) each option remains  outstanding for a period of seven years; (ii) expected dividend yield is 4.53
     percent (based on the most recent quarterly dividend); (iii) expected stock price volatility is .260 (based on 504 trading days
     previous to January 2, 2001); and (iv) the risk-free rate of return is 4.91 percent (based on Treasury yields).

*Represents the highest annualized average compensation (salary and bonus) received for 48 consecutive months during the employee's

 be different from the 48-month period of highest aggregate bonus compensation.
</TABLE>

          Retirement  benefit  amounts shown are in the form of a  straight-life
annuity  to the  employee  and  are  based  on  amounts  listed  in the  Summary
Compensation  Table under the headings "Salary" and "Bonus."  Retirement benefit
amounts  shown are not  subject to any  deduction  for Social  Security or other
offset  amounts.  The  Retirement  Plan  provides  that the  benefit  amount  at
retirement  is subject to  adjustment  in future years to reflect cost of living
increases  to a maximum  adjustment  of 3 percent per year.  As of December  31,
2001,  the executive  officers named in the Summary  Compensation  Table had the
following years of credited service under the plan:

          David G. Gartzke   27 years     Donnie R. Crandell  21 years
          James P. Hallett    7 years     Donald J. Shippar   25 years
          Robert D. Edwards  26 years

          Edwin L. Russell  7 years
          John E. Fuller    7 years

          In 2001 the Board  established  for ALLETE's top four  executives   if
they remain  employed as a senior  executive with ALLETE until age 62, a defined
benefit  retirement  plan which  supplements  amounts  paid under  other  ALLETE
retirement  plans, so that the executive's  total retirement pay is no less than
51 percent of the  executive's  final pay if retirement is at age 62 and no less
than 60 percent of the  executive's  final pay if  retirement is at age 65. This
benefit is reduced by 2.3 percent of pay for each year under 22 years of service
with ALLETE if the executive  retires at age 62 and by 3 percent of pay for each
of the three years between ages 62 and 65.

          With  certain  exceptions,  the  Internal  Revenue  Code of  1986,  as
amended,  (Code)  restricts the aggregate  amount of annual pension which may be
paid to an employee under the Retirement  Plan to $140,000 for 2001. This amount
is subject to  adjustment  in future years to reflect cost of living  increases.
ALLETE's  Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan  provides  for  supplemental
payments by ALLETE to eligible  executives  (including  the  executive  officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table) in amounts sufficient to maintain total
retirement benefits upon retirement at a level which would have been provided by
the Retirement Plan if benefits were not restricted by the Code.

REPORT OF BOARD'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

          Described  below  are  the  compensation  policies  of  the  Executive
Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) effective for 2001
with  respect  to  the  executive  officers  of  ALLETE.  Composed  entirely  of
independent outside directors,  the Committee is responsible for recommending to
the Board policies which govern the executive compensation program of ALLETE and
for administering those policies. Since 1995 the Board has retained the services
of  William M.  Mercer,  Incorporated  (Mercer),  a  benefits  and  compensation
consulting  firm, to assist the Committee in connection  with the performance of
such responsibilities.

          The  role of the  executive  compensation  program  is to help  ALLETE
achieve  its  corporate  goals by  motivating  performance,  rewarding  positive
results and enhancing Total Shareholder  Return.  Recognizing that the potential
impact an individual  employee has on the attainment of corporate goals tends to
increase  at higher  levels  of  responsibility  within  ALLETE,  the  executive
compensation  program provides greater  variability in compensating  individuals
based on results achieved as their  responsibilities  within ALLETE increase. In
other words,  individuals  with the greatest  potential  impact on achieving the
stated  goals have the  greatest  amount to gain when goals are achieved and the
greatest amount at risk when goals are not achieved.

          The  program   recognizes   that,  in  order  to  attract  and  retain
exceptional  executive  talent  needed  to lead  and grow  ALLETE's  businesses,
compensation  must be competitive in the national  market.  To determine  market
levels of compensation for executive officers in 2001, the Committee relied upon
comparative  information  from  general  industrial  companies  in  tandem  with
available specific industry data (i.e., electric utility,  automotive,  finance,
water  utility,  etc.) which was provided and reviewed by Mercer.  All data were
analyzed to determine  median  compensation  levels for comparable  positions in
comparably  sized  companies,  as  measured  by  revenue.

          Internal  Revenue  Code  Section  162(m)  generally  disallows  a  tax
deduction  to public  companies  for  compensation  over $1 million paid for any
fiscal  year  to each  of the  corporation's  CEO and  four  other  most  highly
compensated  executive  officers  as of the end of any fiscal  year.  Qualifying
performance-based  compensation  will not be subject to the  deduction  limit if
certain  requirements are met. The stock options and performance  shares granted
to the executive officers under the Executive Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation
Plan are  intended  to  qualify  as  performance-based  compensation  within the
meaning of Code  Section  162(m) and should  therefore be fully  deductible  for
federal income tax purposes.

          As  described   below,   executive   officers  of  ALLETE   receive  a
compensation  package  which  consists of three  basic  elements:  base  salary,
performance-based  compensation and supplemental  executive benefits.  The CEO's
compensation is discussed separately.

BASE SALARY

          Base  salaries  are set at a level so  that,  if the  target  level of
performance is achieved under the  performance-based  plans as described  below,
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of the
performance-based  compensation  plans,  will be near  the  midpoint  of  market
compensation as described above.

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION

          The performance-based compensation plans of ALLETE are intended by the
Committee to reward executives for achieving  financial and non-financial  goals
which the Committee  determines will be required to achieve  ALLETE's  strategic
and budgeted goals.

          Performance  goals under  performance-based  plans are  established in
advance  by the  Committee  and the  Board  of  Directors.  A  target  level  of
performance under the performance-based plans meets budget or represents a Total
Shareholder  Return ranking in the top half of the peer group  described  below.
Total Shareholder  Return is defined as stock price  appreciation plus dividends
reinvested on the ex-dividend date throughout the relevant  performance  period,
divided by the fair market value of a share at the beginning of the  performance
period.  With target  performance,  it is the Committee's  intent that executive
compensation  (including  the value of stock  options  granted) will be near the
midpoint of the relevant  market.  If no performance  awards are  earned  and no
value is  attributed  to the stock  options  granted,  compensation  of ALLETE's
executive officers would be significantly below the midpoint market compensation
level,  while  performance  at increments  above the target level will result in
total compensation above the midpoint of the market.

                                       9

<PAGE>
          ALLETE's performance-based compensation plans include:

        - RESULTS SHARING.  The  Results  Sharing  awards are based on corporate
          earnings per share and business  unit  operating  income.  Awards were
          available  in  2001  to all  employees  in  the  electric,  water  and
          corporate groups on the same percentage-of-pay basis. Target financial
          performance  will  result  in an award of 5  percent  of base  salary,
          assuming safety and environmental  protection goals established by the
          Committee are also accomplished.

        - EXECUTIVE  ANNUAL  INCENTIVE PLAN. The Executive Annual Incentive Plan
          is  intended to focus  executive  attention  on meeting and  exceeding
          annual financial and non-financial  business unit goals established by
          the   Committee.   For  2001   financial   goals  were  business  unit
          contributions to net income, operating free cash flow and earnings per
          share.  These  financial  performance  measures  were  chosen  by  the
          Committee  because of their  positive  correlation  over time with the
          Total  Shareholder  Return  achieved  by ALLETE for its  shareholders.
          Target level  performance is earned if budgeted  financial results are
          achieved.  The results shown on the Summary Compensation Table reflect
          financial operating performance by business units in 2001 ranging from
          below budget to substantially above budget.

        - LONG-TERM   INCENTIVE  PLAN  (LTIP).  Under  the  Executive  Long-Term
          Incentive  Compensation Plan, the executive  officers,  other than the
          CEO,  of  ALLETE  have  been  awarded  stock   options   annually  and
          performance  shares  biennially  having in the aggregate  target award
          values  ranging  from 25 percent to 50  percent of their  annual  base
          salaries. The value has been allocated 70 percent to stock options and
          30 percent to  performance  shares.  The stock options will have value
          only if ALLETE's  Common  Stock  price  appreciates.  The  performance
          shares  granted to the  corporate  group for the two-year  performance
          period  ending  December  31, 2001 had value if the Total  Shareholder
          Return of ALLETE over the two-year period ranked at least in the third
          quartile of a peer group of 16 diversified  electric utilities adopted
          by the Committee as appropriate  comparators.  Twenty-five  percent of
          the  performance  share award to business unit executives was based on
          the  foregoing  ranking  and 75 percent  was based on other  financial
          measures  selected by the Committee  because of their correlation over
          time with Total Shareholder  Return.  Dividend  equivalents  accrue on
          performance  shares  during  the  performance  period  and are paid in
          Common Stock only to the extent  performance  goals are achieved.  The
          maximum  payout is 200  percent of the target  award.  If earned,  the
          performance shares will be paid in Common Stock with 50 percent of the
          award paid after the end of the  performance  period and the remaining
          50  percent  on  the  first  anniversary  thereof.  For  the  two-year
          performance  period ending  December 31, 2001,  shareholders of ALLETE
          realized  a  Total  Shareholder   Return  of  64.3  percent  on  their
          investment in Common Stock,  ranking  ALLETE third among the 16-member
          peer group. The LTIP payout for 2001 shown in the Summary Compensation
          Table  includes  a  payout  of  50 percent of the award earned for the
          performance  period ending December 31, 2001, and the final 25 percent
          of the award earned for the  performance  period  ending  December 31,
          1999,  25 percent of which was  reported  for 2000 and 50 percent  for
          1999.

          For the  two-year  performance  period  beginning  January  2002,  the
          Committee  increased target  opportunities for the executive  officers
          (other  than the CEO) to a range of 50 to 100  percent of annual  base
          salary, to remain in line with trends in executive compensation and to
          keep the total  executive  compensation  package  at the median of the
          relevant  market.  All  performance  shares  granted for the  two-year
          performance period beginning in 2002 will use Total Shareholder Return
          as the performance  measure and will have value only if ALLETE's Total
          Shareholder  Return  ranks at least eleventh among a peer  group of 16
          utilities.

          The Committee has determined that these awards are consistent with its
philosophy of aligning executive  officers' interests with those of shareholders
and to the performance of ALLETE.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE BENEFITS

          ALLETE has established a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
to compensate certain employees,  including the executive officers, equitably by
replacing  benefits  not  provided by  ALLETE's  Flexible  Benefit  Plan and the
Employee Stock  Ownership Plan due to  government-imposed  limits and to provide
retirement benefits which are competitive with those offered by other businesses
with which ALLETE competes for executive

                                       10
<PAGE>
talent.  The SERP also  provides  employees  whose  salaries  exceed  the salary
limitations for tax-qualified plans imposed by the Code with additional benefits
such that they receive in aggregate  the benefits  they would have been entitled
to receive had such limitations not been imposed.

RETIREMENT AGREEMENT

          On August  28,  2001 the Board  approved  a  Retirement  Agreement  in
connection with Mr.  Russell's  retirement from ALLETE,  as he stepped down from
the positions of Chairman,  President and CEO. Under this agreement, Mr. Russell
was paid  amounts  totaling  $820,575,  which  represent  payment  of his salary
through  the end of the year,  8/12 of his annual  bonus for the year 2000 which
was  paid in lieu of an  annual  bonus  for  2001,  the last 25  percent  of the
Long-Term  Incentive  Plan award for the two-year  performance  period ending in
1999 (which  would have been paid in February  2002 had he remained  with ALLETE
through year-end) and less than $50,000 in other benefits. Also, the time-period
for exercise of Mr. Russell's stock options was extended to three years from the
date of his retirement.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

          On  August  28,  2001  the  Board of  Directors  elected  Mr.  Gartzke
President of ALLETE,  making him the lead executive officer.  In connection with
this action,  the Board (i)  increased  Mr.  Gartzke's  salary from  $270,000 to
$475,000, (ii) paid him a $250,000 bonus, 60 percent of which was paid in Common
Stock,  and (iii) awarded him a retention  grant of 20,000  deferred share units
(reported under Restricted  Stock in the Summary  Compensation  Table),  half of
which will be earned if Mr.  Gartzke  remains  ALLETE's  top  executive  officer
through  2002 and the  remainder  of which will be earned if he remains  through
2003. The Committee has designed Mr. Gartzke's  compensation  package to provide
substantial  incentive to achieve and exceed the Board's  financial  performance
goals for ALLETE and Total Shareholder Return goals for ALLETE's shareholders.

          Under ALLETE's  Results Sharing Plan, Mr. Gartzke was awarded $19,352,
or 6 percent of his salary paid in 2001, based 50 percent on corporate  earnings
per share and 50 percent on an average of business unit Results  Sharing awards.
Under the Executive  Annual  Incentive Plan in 2001, Mr. Gartzke earned an award
of $220,238,  or 46 percent of his year-end  salary,  which rewarded Mr. Gartzke
for achieving 2001 corporate  earnings per share results that were at target, as
well as for achievement of non-financial goals established by the Committee.

          Mr. Gartzke's compensation also contained elements which motivated him
to focus on the longer-term performance of ALLETE. Under the Long-Term Incentive
Compensation Plan (LTIP), Mr. Gartzke's  annualized target opportunities for the
two-year  performance  period ending December 31, 2001 were valued at 50 percent
of his  salary.  This value is  allocated  70 percent to stock  options  awarded
annually and 30 percent to performance  shares awarded in  even-numbered  years.
The stock options and performance shares have the same  characteristics as those
issued to other executive officers as described above. Mr. Gartzke's performance
share  payouts  are  based  on  Total  Shareholder   Return.  For  the  two-year
performance  period ending December 31, 2001,  shareholders of ALLETE realized a
Total  Shareholder  Return of 64.3 percent on their  investment in ALLETE Common
Stock,  ranking ALLETE third among the 16-member peer group. The LTIP payout for
2001 shown in the  Summary  Compensation  Table  includes  a final  payout of 25
percent of the award earned for the performance  period ending December 31, 1999
and an initial 50 percent of the award earned for the performance  period ending
December 31, 2001. In  recognition of Mr.  Gartzke's  promotion to the office of
chief  executive  officer of ALLETE in January  2002,  and  consistent  with the
Compensation  Committee's  desire to motivate him to focus on  increasing  Total
Shareholder  Return over the longer term, Mr.  Gartzke's  annualized LTIP target
opportunity for the two-year  performance  period commencing January 1, 2002 was
increased to 150 percent of his salary.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

          The  Audit  Committee  of the  Board of Directors, consisting  of four
independent,  non-employee  directors,  assists  the Board in  carrying  out its
oversight  responsibilities  for ALLETE's  financial  reporting  process,  audit
process and internal controls. The Audit Committee reviews and recommends to the
Board of  Directors: (i) that the audited  financial  statements  be included in
ALLETE's  Annual Report on Form 10-K; and (ii) the selection of the  independent
auditors to audit the books and records of ALLETE.

          The Audit  Committee has: (i) reviewed and discussed  ALLETE's audited
financial  statements  for the year  ending  December  31,  2001  with  ALLETE's
management and with ALLETE's independent  auditors;  (ii) met with management to
discuss  all  financial  statements  prior  to  their  issuance  and to  discuss
significant   accounting  issues;  (iii)  discussed  with  ALLETE's  independent
auditors  the  matters  required  to be  discussed  by SAS 61  (Codification  of
Statements on Auditing  Standards)  which  include,  among other items,  matters
related to the conduct of the audit of ALLETE's financial  statements;  and (iv)
received and  discussed  the written  disclosures  and the letter from  ALLETE's
independent  auditors  required by Independence  Standards Board Statement No. 1
(independence  discussions with audit  committees) which relate to the auditor's
independence  from ALLETE.  Based on the review and discussions  with management
and the independent  auditors,  the Audit Committee  recommended to the Board of
Directors that the audited  financial  statements be included in ALLETE's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December  31,  2001 for filing  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

          Management has advised the Audit Committee that PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP's fees for the year ended December 31, 2001 were as follows ($ millions):

          Audit fees                                         $1.1

          Financial information systems design
          and implementation fees                            $0.0

          All other fees                                     $1.2

All other fees in the  foregoing  table are  comprised of $1 million for various
tax services and $0.2 million for audits of employee benefit plans, work related
to stock and debt offerings, and consultations on various accounting matters. We
have  considered  and  determined  that the provision of the non-audit  services
noted   in   the    foregoing    table   is    compatible    with    maintaining
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence.

ALLETE COMMON STOCK PERFORMANCE

          The following graph compares  ALLETE's  cumulative  Total  Shareholder
Return on its Common Stock with the  cumulative  return of the S&P 500 Index and
the S&P Utilities Index, a capitalization-weighted  index of 27 stocks, which is
designed to measure the performance of the electric power utility company sector
of the S&P 500 Index.  The S&P 500 Index is a  capitalization-weighted  index of
500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through
changes  in the  aggregate  market  value of 500 stocks  representing  all major
industries.  Because  this  composite  index  has a  broad  industry  base,  its
performance may not closely track that of a composite index comprised  solely of
electric  utilities.  The calculations  assume a $100 investment on December 31,
1996 and reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date.

              ITEM NO. 2 - APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The  Audit   Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  ALLETE  has
recommended  the  appointment  of  PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP  as  independent
auditors for  ALLETE for the year 2002.  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP  has  acted
in this capacity since October 1963.

          A representative  of the accounting firm will be present at the Annual
Meeting of  Shareholders,  will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or
she so desires and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

          In connection with the 2001 audit, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reviewed
ALLETE's annual report, examined the related financial statements,  and reviewed
interim  financial  statements  and  certain  filings of ALLETE with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

          The  Board  of  Directors  recommends a vote "FOR"  the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP as ALLETE's independent  auditors for 2002.

     ITEM NO. 3 - APPROVAL OF RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THE
                  ALLETE EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Shareholders are asked to approve an amendment to the ALLETE Executive
Long-Term Incentive  Compensation Plan (Plan) increasing the number of shares of
ALLETE  Common  Stock  authorized  for issuance  thereunder  by a total of three
million  shares.  As a result,  4,252,746  shares will be available for issuance
under the Plan.  The Plan is integral to ALLETE's  ability to attract and retain
talented  executives and to more closely align their interests with those of the
shareholders.  Approximately  390 officers and key  executives of ALLETE and its
subsidiaries  currently  participate in the Plan.  The following  summary of the
principal  provisions  of the Plan is not a complete  description  of all of its
terms and provisions.

          The Board of Directors  recommends  a vote "FOR" the  amendment to the
Plan.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN

          The  purpose of the Plan is to promote  the  success  and  enhance the
value of ALLETE by linking participants' personal interests to those of ALLETE's
shareholders   and  providing  participants  with an incentive  for  outstanding
performance.  The Plan is further  intended  to assist  ALLETE in its ability to
motivate,  attract  and  retain  the  services  of  participants  upon  whom the
successful  conduct of its  operations  is largely  dependent.  The Plan  became
effective on January 1, 1996 and shall remain in effect, subject to the right of
the Board of  Directors  to  terminate  the Plan at any time,  until all  shares
subject to the Plan have been purchased or acquired. No grants may be made under
the Plan after the tenth  anniversary  of the effective  date. The Board may, at
any time, and from time to time, alter, amend,  suspend or terminate the Plan in
whole  or  in  part;  provided,   however,  that  no  amendment  which  requires
shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with Rule 16b-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  will be effective unless
approved  by the  shareholders.  The  Plan  is  administered  by  the  Executive
Compensation  Committee (Committee) of the  Board of Directors,  which  consists
exclusively  of outside  directors as defined in Section  1.162-27(e)(3)  of the
Treasury  Regulations  with  respect  to grants  made to certain  key  executive
officers.

          The  Common  Stock  available  for  issuance  under  the  Plan  may be
increased by shares  purchased on the open market or shares tendered to exercise
options or withheld to satisfy tax withholding  requirements in connection  with
the  Plan.  If any  corporate  transaction  occurs  that  causes a change in the
capitalization  of ALLETE,  the Committee is authorized to make such adjustments
to the number and class of shares of stock  delivered,  and the number and class
and/or price of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding  grants made under
the  Plan  as  it  deems  appropriate  and  equitable  to  prevent  dilution  or
enlargement of participants' rights.

          Officers  and  key  executives  of  ALLETE  and its  subsidiaries  are
eligible to  participate  in the Plan, as determined by the Committee, including
employees who are members of the Board of Directors  but excluding directors who
are not employees.

PLAN BENEFITS

         During fiscal 2001,  stock options to purchase 151,588 shares of Common
Stock were granted to ALLETE's  named  executive  officers,  as set forth in the
table  captioned  "Option Grants in Last Fiscal Year" above.  Stock options were
granted  during  the year to all  executive  officers  of  ALLETE  as a group to
purchase 208,339 shares of Common Stock at an average weighted exercise price of
$23.625 per share. In addition, stock options were granted to all other eligible
executive  employees of ALLETE as a group to purchase  573,733  shares of Common
Stock at an average weighted  exercise price of $23.625 per share. The number of
options  or other  awards to be  granted  in the  future to  ALLETE's  executive
officers and to other  employees is not  determinable at this time. On March 15,
2002 the  closing  price on the New York  Stock  Exchange  of  Common  Stock was
$27.95 per share.

                                       14

<PAGE>
GRANTS UNDER THE PLAN

          STOCK OPTIONS. The Committee may grant incentive stock options (ISOs),
nonqualified  stock options or a combination  thereof under the Plan. The option
price for each such grant will be the closing  sale price of Common Stock on the
date of grant.  Options will expire at such times as the Committee determines at
the time of grant;  provided,  however, that no option will be exercisable later
than the tenth  anniversary  of its grant.  Simultaneously  with the grant of an
option,  a  participant  may  receive  dividend  equivalents  which  entitle the
participant  to a right to receive the value of the dividends  paid with respect
to the number of shares held under  option from the date of grant to the date of
exercise. The Committee will determine at the time that dividend equivalents are
granted  the  conditions,  if  any,  to  which  the  payment  of  such  dividend
equivalents are subject.

          Options  granted under the Plan will be  exercisable at such times and
subject to such  restrictions  and  conditions  as the  Committee  may  approve;
provided  that no option may be  exercisable  prior to six months  following its
grant.  The option  exercise price is payable in cash, in shares of Common Stock
having a fair market value equal to the exercise price,  by sharing  withholding
or in a combination of the foregoing.  The Committee may allow, along with other
means of  exercise,  cashless  exercise as permitted  under the Federal  Reserve
Board's  Regulation T, subject to the applicable  securities laws. The Committee
may grant options which  include an ownership  retention (or reload)  provision,
whereby a participant who pays the exercise of an option by delivering shares of
Common Stock will  automatically be granted an ownership  retention option (also
known as a reload  option) to  purchase  shares of Common  Stock,  the number of
shares subject to such ownership  retention  option being equal to the number of
shares  tendered to exercise the original  option and the term of such ownership
retention option being equal to the remaining term of the original  option.  The
exercise price of the ownership  retention  option would be the closing price of
ALLETE's Common Stock on the date the ownership retention option is granted. The
ownership  retention  option  feature  encourages  executives to exercise  their
options at an earlier date,  thereby  increasing  their stock ownership and more
closely aligning their interests with those of the  shareholders.  The Committee
may permit a participant to defer the receipt of shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of an option  pursuant to an irrevocable  election which  specifies the
future  date or event upon which such shares  will be  distributed.  The maximum
number of shares of Common Stock  subject to options which may be granted to any
single  participant  during any one calendar year is 300,000.  This accommodates
the number of ownership  retention  options  which may be issued if an executive
exercises a large number of options in a given year.

         The  following  is a  brief  summary  of  certain  federal  income  tax
consequences  to ALLETE  and Plan  participants  of the grant  and  exercise  of
options. The tax rules may change at any time. Generally, a participant does not
recognize  taxable income,  and ALLETE is not entitled to a deduction,  upon the
grant of an option.  Upon the exercise of an option, the participant  recognizes
ordinary  income  equal to the excess of the fair market  value of the shares of
common stock acquired over the option exercise price.  The amount of such excess
is  generally  determined  by  reference  to the fair market value of our Common
Stock on the date of exercise. ALLETE is generally entitled to a deduction equal
to the compensation taxable to the participant as ordinary income.

          STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) guaranteed
under  the  Plan  may be in the  form of  freestanding  SARs,  tandem  SARs or a
combination  thereof. The base value of an SAR will be equal to the closing sale
price of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant.  No SAR guaranteed  under
the Plan may be exercisable prior to six months following its grant. The term of
any SAR granted  under the Plan will be determined  by the  Committee,  provided
that the term may not exceed ten years.  Freestanding SARs may be exercised upon
such terms and  conditions  as are imposed by the Committee and explained in the
SAR grant  agreement.  A tandem SAR may be  exercised  only with  respect to the
shares  of  Common  Stock for which  its  related  option is  exercisable.  Upon
exercise  of an SAR, a  participant  will  receive the excess of the fair market
value  of a share  of  Common  Stock on the date of  exercise  over  base  value
multiplied  by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is  exercised.
Payment due to the  participant  upon exercise may be made in cash, in shares of
Common  Stock  having a fair  market  value  equal to the cash  amount,  or in a
combination  of cash and shares,  as  determined by the  Committee.  The maximum
number of SARs which may be granted to any one participant under the Plan in any
calendar year is 40,000.

                                       15
<PAGE>
          RESTRICTED STOCK.  Restricted stock may be granted in such amounts and
subject  to such  terms and  conditions  as  determined  by the  Committee.  The
restrictions  will  generally  lapse  on the  basis  of  the  passage  of  time.
Participants  holding  restricted  stock may  exercise  full voting  rights with
respect to those shares during the restricted  period and will be credited with
regular cash dividends and other distributions with respect to the shares.

          Subject to the Committee's right to determine otherwise at the time of
grant, dividends or distributions credited during the restricted period will be
subject to the same restriction on  transferability  and  forfeitability  as the
shares of restricted  stock with respect to which they were paid.  All dividends
credited  will  be  paid  promptly  following  the  vesting  of the  shares  of
restricted stock to which the dividends or other distributions relate.

          PERFORMANCE  UNITS  AND  PERFORMANCE  SHARES.  Performance  units  and
performance  shares may be granted in the  amounts  and subject to the terms and
conditions as determined by the Committee.  The Committee  will set  performance
goals,  which,  depending  on the  extent  to  which  they  are met  during  the
performance  periods  established  by the  Committee,  will determine the number
and/or value of performance  units/shares that will be paid out to participants.
Performance periods will, in all cases, be at least six months in length.

          Simultaneously  with the grant of performance  shares, the participant
may be granted dividend  equivalents with respect to these  performance  shares.
Dividend  equivalents  will  constitute  rights to be paid amounts  equal to the
dividends declared on an equal number of outstanding shares on all payment dates
occurring during the period between the grant date of the performance shares and
the date the performance shares are earned or paid out.

          Participants   will  receive  payment  of  the  value  of  performance
units/shares  earned after the end of the performance period, or at a later time
as the Committee may determine. Payment of performance units/shares will be made
in cash and/or shares of Common Stock which have an aggregate  fair market value
equal to the value of the earned  performance  units/shares after the end of the
applicable  performance period, in the combination as the Committee  determines.
These shares may be granted subject to any  restrictions  deemed  appropriate by
the Committee.

          Unless  and until  the  Committee  proposes  a change in the goals for
shareholder  vote or  applicable  tax and/or  securities  laws  change to permit
Committee   discretion  to  alter  the  performance   goals  without   obtaining
shareholder  approval,  to avoid the limitations under Code Section 162(m),  the
performance  goals  to be used  for  purposes  of  grants  to  officers  and key
executives  will be  based  upon  any one or more of the  following:  (i)  Total
Shareholder  Return  (measured  as  the  sum of  share  price  appreciation  and
dividends  declared);  (ii)  total  business  unit  return  (a proxy  for  total
shareholder  return at the  business  unit  level);  (iii)  return  on  invested
capital,  assets   or  net  assets;  (iv)  earnings/earnings  growth;  (v)  cash
flow/cash  flow  growth;  (vi) cost of services to  customers;  (vii)  growth in
revenue,  sales,  operating income, net income,  stock price and/or earnings per
share; (viii) return on  shareholder  equity;  (ix) economic value created;  (x)
customer  satisfaction  and/or  customer  service  quality;  and (xi)  operating
effectiveness.

          The  maximum  payout  to  any  one  participant  with  respect  to (i)
performance  units  granted in any  calendar  year is 200 percent of base salary
determined  at the earlier of the  beginning of the  performance  period and the
time the performance goals are set by the Committee; and (ii) performance shares
in any calendar year is 40,000.

          OTHER  GRANTS.  The Committee may make other grants which may include,
without  limitation,  the grant of shares of Common  Stock  based  upon  certain
specified  conditions  and the  payment  of shares in lieu of cash  under  other
ALLETE  incentive  or bonus  programs  in such  manner  and at such times as the
Committee determines.
