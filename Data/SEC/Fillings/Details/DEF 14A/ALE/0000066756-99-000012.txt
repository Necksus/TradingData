                           Notice and Proxy Statement







                         ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                              TUESDAY, MAY 11, 1999
                                DULUTH, MINNESOTA

[LOGO OF MINNESOTA POWER]

                                        March 22, 1999


Dear Shareholder:

     You are cordially  invited to attend Minnesota  Power's 1999 Annual Meeting
of Shareholders on Tuesday,  May 11, 1999 at 10:00 a.m. in the auditorium at the
Duluth  Entertainment  Convention  Center  (DECC).  The DECC is  located  on the
waterfront  at 350 Harbor  Drive in Duluth.  Free  parking is  available  in the
adjoining lot. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I encourage you to attend.

     Minnesota Power's 1998 performance  reflects the successful  implementation
of our strategy, "The Drive Toward 2000," crafted in 1995. We generated, for the
first time, over a billion  dollars in operating  revenue in 1998, a significant
milestone.  Our  operating  free cash flow grew to $123  million,  exceeding our
expectations.  Importantly, our earnings continued to grow, with 1998 net income
14 percent over 1997,  and  earnings  per share up by 9 percent.  As a result of
this strong  performance,  in January 1999 we announced a 5 percent  increase in
our dividend and a two-for-one stock split.

     At the Annual  Meeting,  11 nominees  will stand for election to the Board.
Also,  shareholders  will vote on resolutions to appoint  PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as the Company's independent  accountants,  and to approve amendments to the
Company's  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive   Compensation  Plan,  including  the
reservation  of  additional  shares of Common Stock to be issued under the plan.
Reservation of additional shares will permit granting stock-based  incentives to
more management employees,  thereby further aligning management's interests with
those of the  shareholders.  I believe this long-term  plan has sharply  focused
management's  attention on enhancing shareholder value. In the three years since
1996 when the long-term  plan became  effective,  the value of your Common Stock
has  increased  86.9 percent (23.1  percent on an  annualized  basis),  assuming
reinvestment of dividends.  The Board of Directors  recommends approval of these
resolutions.

     After our  Annual  Meeting,  we  invite  you to visit  with our  directors,
officers and employees  over a box lunch in the Lake Superior  Ballroom  located
within the DECC. If you plan to attend,  please return the enclosed  reservation
card.

     It is  important  that your shares be  represented  at the Annual  Meeting.
Please sign,  date and promptly  return the enclosed  proxy card in the envelope
provided,  or, if applicable, follow the easy instructions for phone or Internet
voting.

     Thank you for your investment in Minnesota Power.


                                        Sincerely,


                                        Edwin L. Russell

                                        Edwin L. Russell
                                        Chairman, President and
                                        Chief Executive Officer

Board and Committee Meetings in 1998

         During  1998 the Board of  Directors  held 5  meetings.  The  Executive
Committee,  which held 8 meetings during 1998,  provides  oversight of corporate
financial matters,  performs the functions of a director  nominating  committee,
and is  authorized  to  exercise  the  authority  of the Board in the  intervals
between  meetings.  Shareholders  may  recommend  nominees  for  director to the
Executive Committee by addressing the Secretary of the Company, 30 West Superior
Street, Duluth,  Minnesota 55802. The Audit Committee,  which held 3 meetings in
1998, recommends the selection of independent accountants, reviews and evaluates
the Company's  accounting  and financial  practices,  and reviews and recommends
approval of the annual audit report. The Executive Compensation Committee, which
held 4 meetings in 1998,  establishes  compensation and benefit arrangements for
Company officers and other key executives intended to be equitable,  competitive
with the marketplace,  and consistent with corporate  objectives.  All directors
attended 75 percent or more of the aggregate  number of meetings of the Board of
Directors and applicable committee meetings in 1998.

Director Compensation

         Employee  directors  receive  no  additional   compensation  for  their
services as directors.  In 1998 the Company paid each  non-employee  director an
annual retainer fee of $5,000 and 500 shares (1,000 shares after the two-for-one
stock  split  effective  March 2, 1999) of Common  Stock  under the terms of the
Company's Director Stock Plan. In addition,  each non-employee director was paid
$950 for each Board,  Committee,  and subsidiary board meeting attended,  except
that  $500 was  paid for  attendance  at a second  meeting  held the same day as
another meeting.  Each non-employee  director who is the Chairman of a Committee
received an additional $150 for each Committee meeting attended.  A $250 fee was
paid for all  conference  call  meetings.  Directors may elect to defer all or a
part of the cash portion of their  retainer fees and meeting fees. The shares of
Common Stock paid to directors  with respect to 1998 had an average market price
of $41.31 per share (priced before the  two-for-one  stock split effective March
2, 1999). The Company also provides life insurance of $5,000 on the life of each
non-employee director at an aggregate cost to the Company of $299 in 1998.

         Under the Director Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, effective January 1,
1996,  non-employee  directors  receive  automatic  grants of 725 stock  options
(1,450 options after the two-for-one  stock split effective March 2, 1999) every
year and  performance  shares  valued at $10,000  every  other  year.  The stock
options vest 50 percent after the first year, the remaining 50 percent after the
second  year and  expire on the  tenth  anniversary  of the date of  grant.  The
exercise  price for each grant is the closing sale price of Company Common Stock
on the date of grant.  The  performance  periods for  performance  shares end on
December 31 the year  following the date of grant.  Dividend  equivalents in the
form of additional  performance  shares accrue during the performance period and
are paid only to the extent the underlying grant is earned. The performance goal
of each performance  period is based on Total Shareholder Return for the Company
in comparison to Total Shareholder Return for 16 diversified electric utilities.
Any awards  earned are paid out in Common Stock of the Company.  No  performance
period ended in 1998 and, therefore, no new awards were earned.

Proposals of Shareholders for the 2000 Annual Meeting

         All proposals from  shareholders to be considered for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting scheduled for May 9, 2000 must be
received by the  Secretary of the Company at 30 West  Superior  Street,  Duluth,
Minnesota 55802-2093, not later than November 20, 1999. In addition, the persons
to be named as proxies in the proxy cards  relating  to that Annual  Meeting may
have the  discretion to vote their proxies in accordance  with their judgment on
any matter as to which the  Company  did not have  notice  prior to  February 6,
2000,  without discussion of such matter in the proxy statement relating to that
Annual Meeting.

<F1> The stock  options  vest 50  percent  on  January 2, 1999 and 50 percent on
     January 2, 2000,  except the 9,848 options  granted to Mr.  Russell vest 50
     percent on  December  31,  1999 and 50 percent on December  31,  2000.  The
     options  granted  include an  ownership  retention  option (also known as a
     reload  option)  provision  whereby,  upon his  payment in shares of Common
     Stock of the option  exercise price, a reload option to purchase the number
     of shares  tendered to exercise  the original  option will be granted.  All
     stock options are subject to a change-in-control acceleration provision.
<F2> The grant date dollar value of the stock  options is based on a combination
     Black-Scholes, binomial price method. The blended ratio associated with the
     1998  option  grants is .238,  based on an average  industry  Black-Scholes
     ratio of .331 and a Minnesota  Power binomial ratio (as of January 2, 1998)
     of .144.  The method is a  complicated  mathematical  formula  premised  on
     immediate  exercisability and transferability of the options, which are not
     features of the Company's  options granted to executive  officers and other
     employees.  The values shown are theoretical and do not necessarily reflect
     the actual values the recipients may eventually  realize.  Any actual value
     to the  officer or other  employee  will  depend on the extent to which the
     market  value of the  Company's  Common  Stock at a future date exceeds the
     exercise  price.  In addition to the stock prices at grant and the exercise
     prices,  which are  identical,  and the ten-year  term of each option,  the
     following  assumptions for modeling were used to calculate the values shown
     for the options granted in 1998:  expected  dividend yield of 5.752 percent
     (based  on the  most  recent  quarterly  dividend),  expected  stock  price
     volatility of .158 (based on 250 trading days previous to January 2, 1998),
     and the  ten-year  option  term and a risk-  free  rate of  return  of 5.75
     percent (based on Treasury  yields).  The assumptions and the  calculations
     used for the model were provided by William M. Mercer, Inc., an independent
     consulting firm.

</TABLE>

         The table  directly above reflects the number of shares of Common Stock
that can be earned pursuant to the Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation
Plan for the 1998-1999 performance period if the Total Shareholder Return of the
Company (and, for business unit executives, other financial measures established
for business  units that  correlate  to Total  Shareholder  Return)  meets goals
established by the Executive  Compensation  Committee.  These goals are based on
the Company's ranking against a peer group of 16 diversified electric utilities.
Mr. Russell's threshold  performance share award will be earned if the Company's
Total  Shareholder  Return  ranks 11th,  the target  award will be earned if the
Company  ranks 7th and the maximum award will be earned if the Company ranks 3rd
or higher.  For this  comparison  the Total  Shareholder  Return ranking will be
computed over the four-year  period  January 1, 1996 through  December 31, 1999.
Twenty-five  percent of the performance  share award of the other  executives in
the table is based on the  foregoing,  and the  remaining 75 percent is based on
two-year  performance  periods,  using other financial  measures selected by the
Executive  Compensation  Committee  because of their  correlation over time with
Total Shareholder  Return.  Dividend  equivalents  accrue during the performance
period and are paid in shares only to the extent performance goals are achieved.
If earned,  50 percent of the  performance  shares will be paid in Common  Stock
after the end of the performance  period;  the remaining 50 percent will be paid
in Common Stock,  half on the first  anniversary  of the end of the  performance
period and half on the second anniversary thereof. Payment is accelerated upon a
change  in  control  of the  Company  at 200  percent  of the  target  number of
performance  shares  granted  as  increased  by  dividend  equivalents  for  the
performance period.

  48-month  period for highest average salary may be different from the 48-month
  period of highest aggregate bonus compensation.
</TABLE>

         Retirement  benefit  amounts  shown are in the form of a  straight-life
annuity  to the  employee  and  are  based  on  amounts  listed  in the  Summary
Compensation  Table  under the  headings  Salary and Bonus.  Retirement  benefit
amounts  shown are not  subject to any  deduction  for Social  Security or other
offset  amounts.  The  Retirement  Plan  provides  that the  benefit  amount  at
retirement  is subject to  adjustment  in future years to reflect cost of living
increases  to a maximum  adjustment  of 3 percent per year.  As of December  31,
1998,  the executive  officers named in the Summary  Compensation  Table had the
following number of years of credited service under the plan:


         Edwin L. Russell        4 years          John E. Fuller       4 years
         James P. Hallett        4 years          John Cirello         4 years
         Robert D. Edwards      22 years

         With certain exceptions, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(Code)  restricts the aggregate amount of annual pension which may be paid to an
employee under the Retirement  Plan to $130,000 for 1998. This amount is subject
to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living increases. The Company's
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides for supplemental payments by the
Company to eligible  executives  (including the executive  officers named in the
Summary  Compensation  Table) in amounts sufficient to maintain total retirement
benefits  upon  retirement  at a level  which  would have been  provided  by the
Retirement Plan if benefits were not restricted by the Code.

Report of Board's Executive Compensation Committee on Executive Compensation

         Described  below  are  the  compensation   policies  of  the  Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors effective for 1998 with respect
to the  executive  officers of the  Company.  Composed  entirely of  independent
outside  directors,  the Executive  Compensation  Committee is  responsible  for
recommending  to the Board  policies  which  govern the  executive  compensation
program of the  Company and for  administering  those  policies.  Since 1995 the
Board has retained the services of William M. Mercer, Inc. (Mercer),  a benefits
and compensation consulting firm, to assist the Executive Compensation Committee
in connection with the performance of such responsibilities.

                                        9
<PAGE>

         The role of the executive  compensation  program is to help the Company
achieve  its  corporate  goals by  motivating  performance,  rewarding  positive
results and  encouraging  teamwork.  Recognizing  that the  potential  impact an
individual  employee has on the attainment of corporate  goals tends to increase
at higher levels within the Company, the executive compensation program provides
greater  variability in compensating  individuals  based on results  achieved as
their  levels  within the Company  rise.  In other words,  individuals  with the
greatest potential impact on achieving the stated goals have the greatest amount
to gain when goals are achieved  and the greatest  amount at risk when goals are
not achieved.

         The program recognizes that, in order to attract and retain exceptional
executive  talent,  compensation  must be competitive in the national market. To
determine  market levels of  compensation  for executive  officers in 1998,  the
Executive Compensation Committee relied upon comparative information for general
industrial  companies provided by Mercer. The Committee determined that, because
of the  Company's  diversified  operations,  general  industry  data is the most
appropriate market benchmark for the executive officers.  All data were analyzed
to  determine   median   compensation   levels  for   comparable   positions  in
comparably-sized   companies,  as  measured  by  revenue.  While  the  companies
represented  in the  Mercer  survey  data  are not the same as those in the peer
group  used in the  performance  graph,  the  Executive  Compensation  Committee
believes  that  these  companies  are   appropriate   for  market   compensation
comparison,  primarily  because  they are  approximately  the  same  size as the
Company as measured by revenue.

         Code  Section  162(m)  generally  disallows a tax  deduction  to public
companies for  compensation  over $1 million paid for any fiscal year to each of
the corporation's CEO and four other most highly compensated  executive officers
as of the end of any fiscal year. Qualifying performance-based compensation will
not be subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements are met. The stock
options and performance  shares granted in 1998 to the executive  officers under
the Executive Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation Plan are intended to qualify as
performance-based  compensation  within the meaning of Code  Section  162(m) and
should  therefore  be fully  deductible  for federal  income tax  purposes.  The
Company  currently  intends to structure  the  performance-based  portion of its
executive officer  compensation to achieve maximum  deductibility  under Section
162(m) so long as this can be done without sacrificing flexibility and corporate
objectives.

         As  described  below,  executive  officers  of the  Company  receive  a
compensation  package  which  consists  of four  basic  elements:  base  salary,
performance-based compensation, supplemental executive benefits and perquisites.
The CEO's compensation is discussed separately.

Base Salary

         Base  salaries  are set at a level  so  that,  if the  target  level of
performance is achieved under the  performance-based  plans as described  below,
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of the
performance-based  compensation  plans,  will be near  the  midpoint  of  market
compensation as described  above.  Base salaries of the executive  officers were
increased by an average of 13.2 percent in 1998,  reflecting market adjustments,
merit increases and promotional increases.

Performance-Based Compensation

         The performance-based compensation plans of the Company are intended by
the  Executive   Compensation   Committee  to  reward  executives  for  creating
shareholder  value.  For the  three  year  period  beginning  with 1996 when the
current annual and long-term  incentive  plans were adopted,  Total  Shareholder
Return  was  86.9  percent,  or  23.1  percent  on an  annualized  basis.  Total
Shareholder  Return for the year 1998 was 6.1 percent.  Total Shareholder Return
is  defined  as  stock  price  appreciation  plus  dividends  reinvested  on the
ex-dividend date throughout the relevant performance period, divided by the fair
market value of a share at the beginning of the performance period.

         Performance  goals under  performance-based  plans are  established  in
advance by the Executive Compensation Committee and the Board. A target level of
performance  represents  performance  that is  either  consistent  with or above
budget,  or represents at least median Total Shareholder  Return  performance as
measured against the peer groups described below. With target performance,  plus
the value of stock  options  granted,  executive  compensation  will be near the
midpoint of the relevant  market.  If no performance  awards are earned,  and no
value is attributed to the stock options granted,  compensation of the Company's
executive officers would be significantly below the midpoint market compensation
level,  while  performance  at increments  above the target level will result in
total compensation above the midpoint of the market.

                                       10
<PAGE>
         The Company's performance-based compensation plans include:

     -   Results Sharing.  The Results Sharing award opportunity  rewards annual
         performance of the executive's  responsibility  area as well as overall
         corporate  performance.  Awards are  available to all  employees in the
         electric,  water and  Corporate  groups on the same  percentage  of pay
         basis.  Target  financial  performance  will  result  in an  award of 5
         percent of base salary, assuming non-financial goals established by the
         Executive  Compensation  Committee  are  also  accomplished.  For  1998
         executive officers earned awards averaging 6.5 percent of base salary.

     -   Executive Annual  Incentive  Plan. The Executive Annual Incentive Plan 
         is  intended to focus  executive  attention  on meeting  and  exceeding
         annual financial and  non-financial  business unit goals established by
         the Executive  Compensation  Committee.  For 1998 executive officers in
         the Company's Corporate group were rewarded for performance as measured
         by earnings per share of the  Company's  Common  Stock.  The  executive
         officers  of the  real  estate  business  unit  were  rewarded  for the
         contribution  of  their  business  unit to net  income.  The  executive
         officers of the Company's electric, water and automotive business units
         were rewarded for  performance  of their  respective  business units in
         1998, as measured by operating  cash return on investment  (weighted 50
         percent) and  operating  free cash flow  (weighted  50 percent).  These
         measures  of business  unit  financial  performance  were chosen by the
         Executive  Compensation Committee because of their positive correlation
         over time with the Total Shareholder Return achieved by the Company for
         its  shareholders.  Target  level  performance  is earned  if  budgeted
         financial  results  are  achieved.  In 1998  executive  officers in the
         Corporate  group,  other than the CEO,  earned  awards  averaging  61.9
         percent of base salary  because 1998 basic  earnings per share of $1.35
         on a post-stock  split  basis were above  budget and up 9 percent  over
         1997.  The top executive  officers in the Company's four business units
         earned  awards  ranging  from 56.1 to 107.0  percent of base  salary by
         exceeding budgeted financial and non-financial goals established by the
         Executive Compensation Committee.

     -   Long-Term Incentive  Plans (LTIP). The  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
         Plan (replaced  effective 1996 by the new Executive Long-Term Incentive
         Compensation Plan as described below) is designed to motivate long-term
         strategic  planning  and reward  long-term  corporate  performance,  as
         measured by Total Shareholder Return over four-year performance periods
         commencing each January.  At the outset of each performance period, the
         executive  officers were given a maximum award  opportunity of a stated
         number of shares of the Company's  Common  Stock.  Sixty percent of the
         award  opportunity with respect to the four-year period ending December
         31,  1998,  was based  upon rank  among a peer  group of ten  utilities
         operating in the same geographic region as the Company (Upper Midwest),
         and 40 percent of this  award  opportunity  was based on rank among the
         S&P 500 companies. For the four-year performance period ending December
         31,  1998,  the maximum  award  opportunity  ranged from 2,000 to 6,000
         shares for the executive  officers.  Up to one-half of the award may be
         taken in cash.  The maximum award  opportunity is earned if the Company
         ranks  first or  second  in the  peer  group  and at or above  the 90th
         percentile  among the S&P 500  companies.  The Company  must achieve at
         least a 55th percentile  ranking among a peer group of ten utilities or
         a 40th percentile  ranking among the S&P 500 companies for any award to
         be earned.  For the four-year  performance  period ending  December 31,
         1998,  awards  equal to 70.4 percent of the maximum  share  opportunity
         were earned  because the Company  ranked  second among the utility peer
         group and at the 53rd percentile among the S&P 500 companies. Effective
         for 1996 no further  performance  periods were initiated for executives
         under the  discontinued  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive Plan and there
         will be no further awards under this plan.

         As of January 1996, a new Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation
         Plan was implemented. Under the new plan, the executive officers, other
         than the CEO, of the Company have been awarded stock  options  annually
         and performance  shares biennially having in the aggregate target award
         values  ranging  from 30 percent to 35 percent of their base  salaries.
         The value of the award  opportunity  is divided  equally  between stock
         options and performance  shares. The stock options will have value only
         if the Common Stock price  appreciates.  The performance shares granted
         to the  Corporate  group  will have value if, in 2 years from the grant
         date, the Total Shareholder Return of the Company, over either a 2 or 4
         year performance  measurement period determined in advance by the board
         of  directors,  ranks at least 11th in a peer  group of 16  diversified
         electric  utilities  recommended by Mercer and adopted by the Executive
         Compensation Committee as appropriate comparators.  Twenty five percent
         of the performance  share award to business unit executives is based on
         the  foregoing  ranking,  and 75  percent  is based on other  financial
         measures  selected by the Executive  Compensation  Committee because of
         their  correlation over time with Total  Shareholder  Return.  Dividend
         equivalents accrue on performance shares during the

                                       11
<PAGE>
         performance  period  and are paid in Common  Stock  only to the  extent
         performance  goals are achieved.  The maximum  payout is 200 percent of
         the target award.  If earned,  the  performance  shares will be paid in
         Common  Stock  with 50  percent  of the award paid after the end of the
         performance  period,  25 percent on the first anniversary of the end of
         the performance  period and 25 percent on the second  anniversary.  The
         LTIP payouts for 1998 shown in the Summary  Compensation  Table include
         amounts paid under the old LTIP as described in the preceding paragraph
         and,  for the new LTIP,  include a payout  of 25  percent  of the award
         earned for the 2 year  performance  period ending December 31, 1997, 50
         percent of which was reported for 1997.

         These awards are consistent with the Executive Compensation Committee's
philosophy  of  linking  a  significant   portion  of  the  executive  officers'
compensation to the performance of the Company as measured by Total  Shareholder
Return or by other measures of financial  performance  which correlate over time
with Total Shareholder Return.

Supplemental Executive Benefits

         The Company has  established a Supplemental  Executive  Retirement Plan
(SERP) to  compensate  certain  employees,  including  the  executive  officers,
equitably by replacing  benefits not provided by the Company's  Flexible Benefit
Plan and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan due to government-imposed  limits and
to provide retirement benefits which are competitive with those offered by other
businesses with which the Company competes for executive  talent.  The SERP also
provides   employees   whose  salaries   exceed  the  salary   limitations   for
tax-qualified  plans imposed by the Code with additional benefits such that they
receive in aggregate  the benefits  they would have been entitled to receive had
such limitations not been imposed.

Perquisites

         The Company provides various  perquisites to assist selected  executive
officers  in  fulfilling  their  business  responsibilities  in a cost  and time
efficient manner,  to the extent they are consistent with competitive  practice.
Perquisites  provided by the  Company to the named  executive  officers  did not
exceed the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the total  salary and bonus  shown
for them in the Summary  Compensation  Table.  The  perquisites  provided by the
Company were reviewed by the Executive  Compensation Committee and determined to
be reasonable and in line with companies of comparable size.

Chief Executive Officer Compensation

         The  Executive  Compensation  Committee  has  endeavored to provide Mr.
Russell  with  a  compensation  package  that  is  at  the  50th  percentile  of
compensation paid by general industrial companies with revenue comparable to the
Company.  The  Committee  has designed  Mr.  Russell's  compensation  package to
provide   substantial   incentive  to  achieve  and  exceed  the  Board's  Total
Shareholder Return goals for the Company's shareholders.

         In June 1998 the Board of Directors increased Mr. Russell's annual base
salary 20 percent.  Approximately  two-thirds  of this increase was to align his
base salary with the median of comparably-sized  companies and one-third related
to his  contributions  to the  performance  of the Company.  Under the Company's
Results  Sharing Plan,  Mr. Russell was awarded  $28,525,  or 6.3 percent of his
base salary, based 50 percent on corporate earnings per share performance and 50
percent  on an  average of  business  unit  Results  Sharing  awards.  Under the
Executive  Annual  Incentive  Plan,  for the Company's  performance  in 1998 Mr.
Russell earned an award of $551,760, or 121 percent of his base salary, based on
a formula established in advance by the Executive  Compensation  Committee which
rewarded  Mr.  Russell,  as well as other  executive  officers in the  Corporate
group,  for achieving  1998 earnings per share results above target,  as well as
for  achievement  of  non-financial  goals,  all  established  by the  Executive
Compensation Committee.

         Mr. Russell's compensation also contains elements which motivate him to
focus  on  the  longer-term  performance  of  the  Company.  For  the  four-year
performance  period ending December 31, 1998, under the  discontinued  Executive
Long-Term  Incentive  Plan,  Mr.  Russell  earned 4,604 shares of Common  Stock,
representing  70.4  percent  of  the  maximum  award  opportunity,  because  the
Company's  Total  Shareholder  Return  ranked  second among the peer group of 10
regional  utilities  and at the 53rd  percentile  among  the S&P 500  companies.
Effective January 1996, no further  performance periods were initiated under the
discontinued plan, and a new Executive Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan was
implemented.  Under the new plan,  Mr.  Russell has been awarded  annual  target
opportunities with an average value equal to 55 percent of his base salary. This
value has been

                                       12
<PAGE>
divided equally between stock options  awarded  annually and performance  shares
awarded in even numbered years. The stock options become fully  exercisable in 2
years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  The  options  will have value
only if the Company's stock price  appreciates.  The performance  shares awarded
have target value if, in 2 years from the date of grant,  the Total  Shareholder
Return realized by Company shareholders ranks at least 7th among a peer group of
16  diversified  electric  utilities  recommended  by Mercer and  adopted by the
Executive  Compensation Committee as appropriate  comparators.  The LTIP payouts
for 1998 shown in the  Summary  Compensation  Table  include the payout from the
discontinued  LTIP as described  above, as well as a payout of 25 percent of the
award  earned  under  the new  LTIP  for the 2 year  performance  period  ending
December 31, 1997, 50 percent of which was reported for 1997.

Minnesota Power Common Stock Performance

         The following graph compares the Company's cumulative Total Shareholder
Return on its Common Stock with the  cumulative  return of the S&P 500 Index and
the S&P Utilities Index, a capitalization-weighted  index of 26 stocks, which is
designed to measure the performance of the electric power utility company sector
of the S&P 500 Index.  The S&P 500 Index is a  capitalization-weighted  index of
500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through
changes  in the  aggregate  market  value of 500 stocks  representing  all major
industries.  Because  this  composite  index  has a  broad  industry  base,  its
performance may not closely track that of a composite index comprised  solely of
electric  utilities.  The calculations  assume a $100 investment on December 31,
1993 and reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date.

               ITEM NO. 2 - APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The  Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  has
recommended  the  appointment  of  PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP  as  independent
accountants for the Company for the year 1999.  PricewaterhouseCoopers has acted
in this capacity since October 1963.

         A  representative  of the accounting firm will be present at the Annual
Meeting of  Shareholders,  will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or
she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

         In connection with the 1998 audit,  PricewaterhouseCoopers reviewed the
Company's annual report, examined the related financial statements, and reviewed
interim  financial  statements  and certain of the  Company's  filings  with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The  Board  of  Directors   recommends  a  vote  "FOR"   approving  the

     ITEM NO. 3 - APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE MINNESOTA POWER
                  EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
                  AND RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL SHARES
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       At its meeting on May 14, 1996, the  shareholders  approved the Minnesota
Power  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan (Plan).  The Board of
Directors adopted,  subject to approval by the shareholders,  certain amendments
to the Plan which increase the number of shares of Company Common Stock reserved
for issuance  thereunder from the remaining 1,900,000 shares currently available
to 4,400,000,  and increase the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to options which may be granted to any single participant during any one
calendar year from 40,000 to 300,000.  All share amounts under this Item reflect
the two-for-one  stock split  effective March 2, 1999.  Increasing the number of
options  to 300,000 in a  calendar  year is a  function  of the stock  ownership
retention  option  program.  As described  below,  shareholder  approval of this
amendment  will  permit the Company to deduct for  federal  income tax  purposes
compensation  attributable to options,  including  ownership  retention  options
(also known as reload options) granted in years when executive officers exercise
a  significant  number of options.  The Board  adopted the  ownership  retention
option  program,  described  below,  to encourage  executives to exercise  their
options  at an  earlier  date,  thereby  substantially  increasing  their  stock
ownership  and  more  closely   aligning  their  interests  with  those  of  the
shareholders.

       The Board of  Directors  recommends  a vote "FOR" the  amendments  to the
Plan.

General  Description of the Minnesota Power Executive Long-Term Incentive
Compensation Plan

       The  purpose  of  the  Minnesota  Power  Executive   Long-Term  Incentive
Compensation  Plan (Plan) is to promote the success and enhance the value of the
Company by linking  participants'  personal  interests  to those of the  Company
shareholders,   providing   participants   with  an  incentive  for  outstanding
performance.  The Plan is further  intended to assist the Company in its ability
to  motivate,  attract  and retain the  services of  participants  upon whom the
successful  conduct of its  operations  is largely  dependent.  The Plan  became
effective on January 1, 1996,  and shall remain in effect,  subject to the right
of the Board of Directors to  terminate  the Plan at any time,  until all shares
subject to the Plan shall have been purchased or acquired. No grants may be made
under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the effective date. The Board may,
at any time and from time to time, alter,  amend,  suspend or terminate the Plan
in  whole  or in part;  provided,  however,  that no  amendment  which  requires
shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with Rule 16b-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, shall be effective unless
approved  by the  shareholders.  The  Plan  is  administered  by  the  Executive
Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors  (Committee),  which  consists
exclusively  of outside  directors as defined in Section  1.162-27(e)(3)  of the
Treasury  Regulations  with  respect  to grants  made to certain  key  executive
officers (Key Executives).

                                       14
<PAGE>

       The Plan initially  authorized the grant of up to 4,200,000  shares (on a
post-stock  split basis) of Company Common Stock, of which 1,900,000  shares now
remain.  The amendment  increases the number of shares  authorized  for grant to
4,400,000, which may include authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, and
may be increased by shares purchased on the open market or  shares tendered
to  exercise  options or withheld to satisfy  tax  withholding  requirements  in
connection  with the Plan.  If any  corporate  transaction  occurs that causes a
change in the capitalization of the Company, the Committee is authorized to make
such adjustments to the number and class of shares of stock  delivered,  and the
number and class and/or price of shares of Common Stock  subject to  outstanding
grants made under the Plan,  as it deems  appropriate  and  equitable to prevent
dilution or enlargement of participants' rights.

       Officers  and key  employees  of the  Company  and its  subsidiaries  are
eligible to participate  in the Plan, as determined by the Committee,  including
employees who are members of the Board of Directors, but excluding directors who
are not employees.

Grants under the Plan

       Stock Options.  The Committee may grant  incentive  stock options (ISOs),
nonqualified  stock options or a combination  thereof under the Plan. The option
price for each such grant  shall be the  closing  sale  price of Company  Common
Stock on the date of grant.  Options shall expire at such times as the Committee
determines  at the time of grant;  provided,  however,  that no option  shall be
exercisable later than the tenth anniversary of its grant.  Simultaneously  with
the grant of an option,  a participant may receive dividend  equivalents,  which
entitle the  participant  to a right to receive the value of the dividends  paid
with respect to the number of shares held under option from the date of grant to
the date of exercise.  The  Committee  will  determine at the time that dividend
equivalents  are  granted the  conditions,  if any, to which the payment of such
dividend equivalents is subject.

       Options  granted  under the Plan shall be  exercisable  at such times and
subject to such  restrictions  and  conditions as the Committee  shall  approve;
provided  that no option  may be  exercisable  prior to 6 months  following  its
grant.  The option  exercise price is payable in cash, in shares of Common Stock
of the Company having a fair market value equal to the exercise  price, by share
withholding or in a combination of the foregoing. The Committee may allow, along
with other means of exercise,  cashless  exercise as permitted under the Federal
Reserve  Board's  Regulation T, subject to the applicable  securities  laws. The
Committee may grant  options  which  include an ownership  retention (or reload)
provision,  whereby a  participant  who pays the exercise  price of an option by
delivering  shares of  Company  Common  Stock will  automatically  be granted an
ownership retention option (also known as a reload option) to purchase shares of
Common Stock,  the number of shares subject to such ownership  retention  option
being equal to the number of shares tendered to exercise the original option and
the term of such ownership retention option being equal to the remaining term of
the original option. The exercise price of the ownership  retention option would
be the closing  price of the  Company's  Common Stock on the date the  ownership
retention option is granted.  The ownership  retention option feature encourages
executives  to exercise  their options at an earlier  date,  thereby  increasing
their stock  ownership and more closely  aligning their  interests with those of
the shareholders. The Committee may permit a participant to defer the receipt of
shares of Common Stock of the Company upon the exercise of an option pursuant to
an irrevocable election which specifies the future date or event upon which such
shares will be distributed.  The Plan initially provided that the maximum number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to options which may be granted to any
single  participant  during  any  one  calendar  year  was  40,000  (on  a  post
two-for-one  stock split basis).  The amendment  increases the maximum number of
shares  subject to options which may be granted  during any one calendar year to
300,000.  Increasing  the number of  options to 300,000 in a calendar  year will
accommodate the number of ownership  retention options which may be issued if an
executive  exercises  a large  number of  options in a given  year.  Shareholder
approval of this amendment is to permit the Company to deduct for federal income
tax  purposes  compensation  attributable  to options  and  ownership  retention
options in excess of the current approved amount of 40,000.

       Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) granted under
the Plan may be in the form of freestanding  SARs,  tandem SARs or a combination
thereof.  The base value of an SAR shall be equal to the closing sale price of a
share of Company  Common  Stock on the date of grant.  No SAR granted  under the
Plan may be exercisable  prior to 6 months  following its grant. The term of any
SAR granted under the Plan shall be determined by the  Committee,  provided that
such term may not exceed 10 years.  Freestanding SARs may be exercised upon such
terms and  conditions  as are imposed by the  Committee and set forth in the SAR
grant  

                                  15
<PAGE>
agreement.  A tandem  SAR may be  exercised  only with  respect to the shares of
Common Stock of the Company for which its related  option is  exercisable.  Upon
exercise  of an SAR, a  participant  will  receive the excess of the fair market
value of a share of Company  Common Stock on the date of exercise  over the base
value  multiplied  by the  number of  shares  with  respect  to which the SAR is
exercised.  Payment due to the participant upon exercise may be made in cash, in
shares of Company  Common  Stock  having a fair market  value equal to such cash
amount,  or in a combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Committee.
The maximum number of SARs which may be granted to any one participant under the
Plan in any calendar year is 40,000.

       Restricted  Stock.  Restricted  stock may be granted in such  amounts and
subject  to such  terms and  conditions  as  determined  by the  Committee.  The
restrictions  will  generally  lapse  on the  basis  of  the  passage  of  time.
Participants  holding  restricted  stock may  exercise  full voting  rights with
respect to those shares during the restricted  period and shall be credited with
regular cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares.
Subject to the  Committee's  right to determine  otherwise at the time of grant,
dividends  or  distributions  credited  during the  restricted  period  shall be
subject to the same restriction on  transferability  and  forfeitability  as the
shares of restricted  stock with respect to which they were paid.  All dividends
credited  shall  be  paid  promptly  following  the  vesting  of the  shares  of
restricted stock to which such dividends or other distributions relate.

       Performance   Units  and  Performance   Shares.   Performance  units  and
performance  shares may be granted in the  amounts and subject to such terms and
conditions as determined by the Committee.  The Committee  shall set performance
goals,  which,  depending  on the  extent  to  which  they  are met  during  the
performance  periods  established  by the  Committee,  will determine the number
and/or value of performance  units/shares that will be paid out to participants.
Performance periods shall, in all cases, be at least 6 months in length.

       Simultaneously  with the grant of performance shares, the participant may
be  granted  dividend  equivalents  with  respect  to such  performance  shares.
Dividend  equivalents  shall  constitute  rights to be paid amounts equal to the
dividends declared on an equal number of outstanding shares on all payment dates
occurring during the period between the grant date of the performance shares and
the date the performance shares are earned or paid out.

       Participants   shall  receive   payment  of  the  value  of   performance
units/shares  earned after the end of the performance  period,  or at such later
time as the Committee may determine.  Payment of performance  units/shares shall
be made in cash and/or  shares of Company  Common  Stock which have an aggregate
fair  market  value  equal to the value of the earned  performance  units/shares
after the end of the applicable  performance  period, in such combination as the
Committee  determines.  Such shares may be granted  subject to any  restrictions
deemed appropriate by the Committee.

       Unless  and  until the  Committee  proposes  a change  in such  goals for
shareholder  vote or  applicable  tax and/or  securities  laws  change to permit
Committee   discretion  to  alter  such  performance   goals  without  obtaining
shareholder  approval,  to avoid the limitations under Code Section 162(m),  the
performance  goals to be used for purposes of grants to Key Executives  shall be
based  upon  any one or more of the  following:  (i)  total  shareholder  return
(measured as the sum of share price appreciation and dividends  declared),  (ii)
total business unit return (a proxy for total shareholder return at the business
unit  level),  (iii) return on invested  capital,  assets,  or net assets,  (iv)
earnings/earnings  growth, (v) cash flow/cash flow growth, (vi) cost of services
to consumers,  (vii) growth in revenues,  sales,  operating income,  net income,
stock price and/or  earnings per share,  (viii) return on  shareholders  equity,
(ix) economic value created,  (x) customer  satisfaction and/or customer service
quality, and (xi) operating effectiveness.

       The maximum payout to any one participant (i) with respect to performance
units granted in any calendar  year is 200 percent of base salary  determined at
the  earlier  of the  beginning  of the  performance  period  and the  time  the
performance  goals are set by the Committee and (ii) with respect to performance
shares in any calendar year is 40,000 shares.

       Other  Grants.  The  Committee  may make other  grants which may include,
without  limitation,  the grant of shares of Common  Stock  based  upon  certain
specified  conditions  and the  payment  of shares in lieu of cash  under  other
Company  incentive  or bonus  programs  in such  manner and at such times as the
Committee determines.

                                       16

<PAGE>
Termination of Employment; Transferability

       In  the  event  a  participant's   employment  is  terminated   during  a
performance  period,  before grants become  exercisable or vested, or after they
become  exercisable but before exercise,  the Committee shall determine,  at the
time of grant, participants' rights, if any, with respect to such grants. Grants
may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned  or  otherwise  alienated  or
hypothecated,  other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  A
participant's  rights shall be exercisable only by the participant during his or
her lifetime.

Change in Control

       As of the  effective  date of a change  in  control  of the  Company,  as
defined in the Plan, (i) any option or SAR outstanding shall become  immediately
exercisable;  (ii) any restricted  portion of performance shares granted for the
entire  performance  period  including  dividend   equivalents  for  the  entire
performance  period shall be paid out, in cash or in stock, as determined by the
Committee;  and (iii) any earned  performance  units or  performance  shares (as
increased by any dividend  equivalents  to the date of payment) not yet paid out
shall  be paid  out  immediately,  in cash or in  stock,  as  determined  by the
Committee.  There shall not, however,  be any accelerated payout with respect to
performance grants made less than 6 months prior to the change in control.

Federal Income Tax Consequences

       The  following  is a brief  description  of the federal tax  consequences
related to options awarded under the Plan.

       Consequences to the Optionholder. The grant of options under the Plan has
no federal income tax consequences to the  optionholder.  The exercise of an ISO
is  generally  not taxable for regular  federal  income tax  purposes if certain
holding period  requirements are satisfied.  Upon the exercise of a nonqualified
stock option,  the optionholder will generally  recognize  ordinary income in an
amount  equal to the  excess of the fair  market  value of the shares of Company
Common Stock at the time of exercise over the amount paid as the exercise price.
The  ordinary   income   recognized  in  connection  with  the  exercise  by  an
optionholder  of a  nonqualified  stock  option will be subject to both wage and
employment tax withholding.  The optionholder's tax basis in the shares acquired
pursuant to the  exercise  of an option  will be the amount  paid upon  exercise
plus, in the case of a nonqualified  stock option, the amount of ordinary income
recognized by the optionholder upon exercise.

       If an  optionholder  disposes of shares of Company  Common Stock acquired
upon  exercise of a  nonqualified  stock  option in a taxable  transaction,  the
optionholder  will  recognize  capital  gain or loss in an  amount  equal to the
difference  between his or her basis (as discussed above) in the shares sold and
the total amount realized upon  disposition.  Any such capital gain or loss will
be long-term  depending on whether the shares of Company  Common Stock were held
for more  than  one year  from the date  such  shares  were  transferred  to the
optionholder.  The  optionholder  will generally also recognize  capital gain or
loss upon subsequent  disposition of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of
an ISO if the holding period requirements are satisfied.

       Consequences to the Company. There are no federal income tax consequences
to the Company by reason of the grant of ISOs or  nonqualified  stock options or
the exercise of ISOs (other than disqualifying  dispositions).  The Company will
generally  be  entitled  to a  federal  income  tax  deduction  at the  time the
optionholder  recognizes  ordinary  income from the  exercise of a  nonqualified
stock option, and the Company will be entitled to a federal income tax deduction
in the amount of the ordinary income so recognized (as described  above). To the
extent the optionholder  recognizes ordinary income by reason of a disqualifying
disposition  of the stock  acquired upon  exercise of ISOs,  the Company will be
entitled  to a  corresponding  deduction  in the year in which  the  disposition
occurs.  Any  deduction  to which the Company may be entitled  may be limited by
reason of Code Section 162(m).

       The  foregoing  discussion is not a complete  description  of the federal
income tax aspects of ISOs and  nonqualified  stock  options  under the Plan. In
addition,  administrative and judicial interpretations of the application of the
federal  income  tax laws are  subject  to change.  Furthermore,  the  foregoing
discussion does not address state or local consequences.

       The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the proposed amendments to
the Plan and the reservation of additional shares thereunder.
