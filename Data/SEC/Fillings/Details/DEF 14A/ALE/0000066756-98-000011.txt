                                               March 19, 1998


Dear Shareholder:

         You are  cordially  invited to attend  Minnesota  Power's  1998  Annual
Meeting of Shareholders on Tuesday, May 12, 1998 at 10:30 a.m. in the auditorium
at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center (DECC). The DECC is located on the
waterfront  at 350 Harbor  Drive in Duluth.  Free  parking is  available  in the
adjoining lot.

         Come  hear the exciting  story of our  progress in 1997,  the year in
which the value of your  investment in Minnesota Power Common Stock increased 69
percent, assuming reinvestment of dividends. This compares favorably to the
Standard and Poor's Electric  Utility Index of 26 utilities  which increased
26.2 percent in 1997. In all, the market value of Minnesota Power Common Stock 
increased by over half a billion dollars.

         At the Annual  Meeting,  our  shareholders  will vote on resolutions to
elect a Board of 12 directors,  approve the appointment of Price  Waterhouse LLP
as the  Company's  independent  accountants,  change  the  Company's  name  from
Minnesota  Power & Light  Company to  Minnesota  Power,  Inc.,  and increase the
amount of Common Stock authorized for issuance.

         While  recognizing  our  Minnesota  heritage,  our  proposed  new  name
reflects  a changing  identity  as we  transition  from a  traditional  regional
electric  utility to a diversified  corporation  serving  customers across North
America.

         After our Annual  Meeting,  we invite you to visit with our  directors,
officers and employees over a box lunch. If you plan on attending, please return
the enclosed reservation card.

         It is important that your shares be represented at the Annual  Meeting.
At your earliest  convenience,  please sign,  date,  and mail the enclosed proxy
card in the envelope provided.

         Thank you for your investment in Minnesota Power.

                                               Sincerely,

                                               Edwin L. Russell

                                               Edwin L. Russell
                                               Chairman, President and

BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS IN 1997

         During  1997 the Board of  Directors  held 5  meetings.  The  Executive
Committee,  which held 7 meetings during 1997,  provides  oversight of corporate
financial matters,  performs the functions of a director  nominating  committee,
and is  authorized  to  exercise  the  authority  of the Board in the  intervals
between  meetings.  Shareholders  may  recommend  nominees  for  director to the
Executive Committee by addressing the Secretary of the Company, 30 West Superior
Street, Duluth,  Minnesota 55802. The Audit Committee,  which held 5 meetings in
1997, recommends the selection of independent accountants, reviews and evaluates
the Company's  accounting  and financial  practices,  and reviews and recommends
approval of the annual audit report. The Executive Compensation Committee, which
held 3 meetings in 1997,  establishes  compensation and benefit arrangements for
Company officers and other key executives intended to be equitable,  competitive
with the marketplace,  and consistent with corporate  objectives.  All directors
attended 75 percent or more of the aggregate  number of meetings of the Board of
Directors and applicable committee meetings in 1997.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

         Employee  directors  receive  no  additional   compensation  for  their
services as directors. In 1997 the Company paid each director an annual retainer
fee of $5,000 and 500 shares of Common  Stock  under the terms of the  Company's
Director  Stock Plan.  In addition,  each director was paid $950 for each Board,
Committee, and subsidiary board meeting attended,  except that $500 was paid for
attendance  at a second  meeting  held the same  day as  another  meeting.  Each
director who is the Chairman of a Committee received an additional $150 for each
Committee  meeting  attended.  A $250  fee  was  paid  for all  conference  call
meetings.  Directors  may  elect to defer all or a part of the cash  portion  of
their  retainer  fees and  meeting  fees.  The  shares of Common  Stock  paid to
directors  with respect to 1997 had an average market price of $34.91 per share.
The Company also provides life  insurance of $5,000 on the life of each director
at an aggregate cost to the Company of $320 in 1997.

             For the  four-year  period  ending  December  31,  1997,  directors
received  a  pay-out  for the  final  four-year  performance  period  under  the
discontinued    Directors'    Long-Term    Incentive    Plan   which    provides
performance-based  compensation based on Total Shareholder Return of the Company
on the same terms as the discontinued  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive Plan (see
page 10),  except that a director's  maximum award  opportunity is 600 shares of
Common Stock.  Total Shareholder  Return is defined as stock price  appreciation
plus dividends  reinvested on the  ex-dividend  date  throughout the performance
period,  divided by the fair  market  value of a share at the  beginning  of the
performance  period.  In the four-year  performance  period ending  December 31,
1997, the Company's Total Shareholder Return ranked second among a peer group of
10 regional  utilities  and ranked at the 44th  percentile  among the Standard &
Poor's  500 (S&P  500)  companies,  resulting  in an award to each  non-employee
director of 378 shares of Common Stock, which is 63 percent of the maximum award
opportunity.

         Under  the new  Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive  Plan,  effective
January 1, 1996,  non-employee  directors  receive automatic grants of 725 stock
options  every year and  performance  shares valued at $10,000 every other year.
The stock options vest 50 percent after the first year, the remaining 50 percent
after the second year and expire on the tenth  anniversary of the date of grant.
The exercise  price for each grant is the closing  sale price of Company  Common
Stock on the date of grant. The performance  periods for performance  shares end
on December 31 the year following the date of grant. Dividend equivalents in the
form of additional  performance  shares accrue during the performance period and
are paid only to the extent the underlying grant is earned. The performance goal
of each performance  period is based on Total Shareholder Return for the Company
in comparison to Total Shareholder Return for 16 diversified electric utilities.
During the two-year performance period ending December 31, 1997, shareholders of
the  Company  realized  a Total  Shareholder  Return  of 76.1  percent  on their
investment in Minnesota  Power Common Stock,  ranking the Company number 1 among
the 16 diversified  utilities.  With this "superior" ranking under the plan, the
directors each earned 794 shares of Common Stock,  an award equal to 200 percent
of their target performance share award. Fifty percent of this performance share
award was paid in stock at the end of the performance  period.  The remaining 50
percent will be paid in stock,  half on the first  anniversary of the end of the
performance period and half on the second anniversary thereof.

     provision.

<F2> The grant date dollar value of the stock options is based on a  combination
     Black-Scholes, binomial price method. The blended ratio associated with the
     January  2,  1997  option  grants  is .239,  based on an  average  industry
     Black-Scholes  ratio of .366 and a Minnesota  Power  binomial  ratio (as of
     January 2, 1997) of .111. The method is a complicated  mathematical formula
     premised on immediate  exercisability  and  transferability of the options,
     which are not  features  of the  Company's  options  granted  to  executive
     officers and other  employees.  The values shown are theoretical and do not
     necessarily  reflect  the  actual  values  the  recipients  may  eventually
     realize.  Any actual value to the officer or other  employee will depend on
     the extent to which the market  value of the  Company's  Common  Stock at a
     future date exceeds the exercise  price. In addition to the stock prices at
     grant and the exercise prices,  which are identical,  and the ten-year term
     of each  option,  the  following  assumptions  for  modeling  were  used to
     calculate  the  values  shown for the  options  granted on January 2, 1997:
     expected  dividend  yield of 7.35 percent  (based on most recent  quarterly
     dividend),  expected  stock price  volatility of .150 (based on 250 trading
     days  previous  to January 2,  1997),  and the  ten-year  option term and a
     risk-free  rate of return of 6.3 percent  (based on Treasury  yields).  The
     assumptions  and the  calculations  used for the  model  were  provided  by
     William M. Mercer, Inc., an independent consulting firm.

benefit, the 48-month period for highest  average salary may be different from the 48-month  period of highest
aggregate bonus compensation.
</TABLE>

         Retirement  benefit  amounts  shown are in the form of a  straight-life
annuity  to the  employee  and  are  based  on  amounts  listed  in the  Summary
Compensation  Table  under the  headings  Salary and Bonus.  Retirement  benefit
amounts  shown are not  subject to any  deduction  for Social  Security or other
offset  amounts.  The  Retirement  Plan  provides  that the  benefit  amount  at
retirement  is subject to  adjustment  in future years to reflect cost of living
increases  to a maximum  adjustment  of 3 percent per year.  As of December  31,
1997,  the executive  officers named in the Summary  Compensation  Table had the
following number of years of credited service under the plan:

         Edwin L. Russell          3 years        John E. Fuller        3 years
         James P. Hallett          3 years        John Cirello          3 years
         Robert D. Edwards        21 years

         With certain exceptions, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(Code)  restricts the aggregate amount of annual pension which may be paid to an
employee under the Retirement  Plan to $125,000 for 1997. This amount is subject
to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living increases. The Company's
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides for supplemental payments by the
Company to eligible  executives  (including the executive  officers named in the
Summary  Compensation  Table) in amounts sufficient to maintain total retirement
benefits  upon  retirement  at a level  which  would have been  provided  by the
Retirement Plan if benefits were not restricted by the Code.

REPORT OF BOARD'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         Described  below  are  the  compensation   policies  of  the  Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors effective for 1997 with respect
to the  executive  officers of the  Company.  Composed  entirely of  independent
outside  directors,  the Executive  Compensation  Committee is  responsible  for
recommending  to the Board  policies  which  govern the  executive  compensation
program of the  Company and for  administering  those  policies.  Since 1995 the
Board has retained the services of William M. Mercer, Inc. (Mercer),  a benefits
and compensation consulting firm, to assist the Executive Compensation Committee
in connection with the performance of such responsibilities.

         The role of the executive  compensation  program is to help the Company
achieve  its  corporate  goals by  motivating  performance,  rewarding  positive
results,  and encouraging  teamwork.  Recognizing  that the potential

                                        8
  
<PAGE>

impact an individual  employee has on the attainment of corporate goals tends to
increase at higher levels within the Company, the executive compensation program
provides  greater  variability  in  compensating  individuals  based on  results
achieved as their levels within the Company  rise.  In other words,  individuals
with the  greatest  potential  impact on  achieving  the  stated  goals have the
greatest  amount to gain when goals are achieved and the greatest amount at risk
when goals are not achieved.

         The program recognizes that, in order to attract and retain exceptional
executive  talent,  compensation must be competitive in the national market when
measured  against  comparable  companies  with  respect  to  size  and  business
characteristics  within that market.  For those executives  engaged primarily or
exclusively  in  electric  operations,  the  relevant  market  for  purposes  of
comparison is other electric utilities throughout the country which, on average,
are  comparable  in  size  to  the  Company.   For  those   executives   engaged
substantially  in the  Company's  diversification  activities,  the  market  for
purposes  of  comparison  includes  both  utilities  and  general  industry.  To
determine  market levels of  compensation  for executive  officers in 1997,  the
Executive Compensation Committee relied upon comparative information provided by
Mercer,  based on seven  surveys  including  data  from over 100  utilities  and
several  hundred  general  industrial  companies.  All  data  were  analyzed  to
determine   median   compensation    levels   for   comparable    positions   in
comparably-sized  companies.  While these companies are not the same as those in
the  peer  group  used in the  performance  graph,  the  Executive  Compensation
Committee believes that these companies are appropriate for market  compensation
comparison,  primarily  because  they are  approximately  the  same  size as the
Company as measured by sales revenue.

         The  performance-based   compensation  plans  of  the  Company  are
intended  by the  Executive  Compensation  Committee  to reward  executives  for
creating  shareholder  value. The aggregate market value of the Company's Common
Stock held by shareholders in 1997 grew by over half a billion dollars. In 1997,
the  value  of a  shareholder's  investment  in  Minnesota  Power  Common  Stock
increased by 68.8 percent, as measured by Total Shareholder Return. For 1996 and
1997 combined,  the value of a shareholder's  investment increased 76.1 percent.
This places the Company far ahead of all 26 individual electric utilities in the
Standard & Poor's (S&P)  Electric  Utility Index shown in the performance graph
on page 13. The S&P Electric  Index  recorded  a Total  Shareholder  Return of
26.2 percent for 1997 and 25.9 percent for 1996 and 1997 combined.  Total
Shareholder Return is defined as stock price  appreciation plus dividends 
reinvested on the ex-dividend date throughout the relevant performance period,
divided by the fair market  value  of a  share  at the  beginning  of the 
performance period. The performance-based plans rewarded the executive officers
for this  significant growth in value delivered to the shareholders.

         Code  Section  162(m)  generally  disallows a tax  deduction  to public
companies for  compensation  over $1 million paid to the  corporation's  CEO and
four   other   most   highly   compensated   executive   officers.    Qualifying
performance-based  compensation  will not be subject to the  deduction  limit if
certain  requirements are met. The stock options and performance  shares granted
to the executive officers under the Executive Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation
Plan are  intended  to  qualify  as  performance-based  compensation  within the
meaning of Code  Section  162(m) and should  therefore be fully  deductible  for
federal  income tax  purposes.  The Company  currently  intends to structure the
performance-based  portion  of its  executive  officer  compensation  to achieve
maximum  deductibility  under Section 162(m) so long as this can be done without
sacrificing flexibility and corporate objectives.

         As  described  below,  executive  officers  of the  Company  receive  a
compensation  package  which  consists  of four  basic  elements:  base  salary,
performance-based compensation, supplemental executive benefits and perquisites.
The CEO's compensation is discussed separately.

BASE SALARY

         Base  salaries  are set at a level  so  that,  if the  target  level of
performance is achieved under the  performance-based  plans as described  below,
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of the
performance-based  compensation  plans,  will be near  the  midpoint  of  market
compensation as described  above.  Base salaries of the executive  officers were
increased by an average of 6.8 percent in 1997,  reflecting  market  adjustments
and merit increases.

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION

         Performance  goals under  performance-based  plans are  established  in
advance by the Executive Compensation Committee and the Board. A target level of
performance  represents  performance  that is  either  consistent  with or above
budget,  or represents at least median Total Shareholder  Return  performance as
measured against the peer groups described below. With target performance,  plus
the value of stock  options  granted,  executive  compensation  will be near the
midpoint of the relevant  market.  If no performance  awards are earned,  and no
value is attributed to the stock options granted,  compensation of the Company's
executive  officers  would be  approximately  70 percent of the midpoint  market
compensation  level, while performance at increments above the target level will
result in total compensation above the midpoint of the market.

         The Company's performance-based compensation plans include:

     -   RESULTS SHARING.  The Results Sharing award opportunity  rewards annual
         performance of the executive's  responsibility  area as well as overall
         corporate  performance.  Awards are  available to all  employees in the
         electric,  water and  corporate  groups on the same  percentage  of pay
         basis.  Target  financial  performance  will  result  in an  award of 5
         percent of base salary, assuming non-financial goals established by the
         Executive  Compensation  Committee  are  also  accomplished.  For  1997
         executive officers earned awards averaging 6.6 percent of base salary.

     -   ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN. The Annual  Incentive Plan is intended to 
         focus executive attention on meeting and exceeding annual financial and
         non-financial   business  unit  goals   established  by  the  Executive
         Compensation  Committee.  For 1997  corporate  executive  officers were
         rewarded for corporate performance as measured by earnings per share of
         the Company's Common Stock.  The executive  officers of the real estate
         business unit were rewarded for the contribution of their business unit
         to  earnings  per  share.  The  executive  officers  of  the  Company's
         electric,  water,  and  automotive  business  units were  rewarded  for
         performance of their  respective business units in 1997, as measured by
         operating  cash return on  investment  (weighted  50 to 60 percent) and
         operating  free cash flow  (weighted  40 to 50  percent).  Measures  of
         financial  performance  were  chosen  by  the  Executive   Compensation
         Committee  because  of  their  positive   correlation  with  the  Total
         Shareholder Return achieved by the Company for its shareholders. Target
         level performance is earned if budgeted financial results are achieved.
         In  1997  executive  officers  in the  Corporate  group  earned  awards
         averaging 61.5 percent of base salary  because  earnings per share were
         significantly above budget. The top executive officers in the Company's
         four business  units earned awards ranging from 38.5 to 94.0 percent of
         base salary by exceeding  budgeted  financial and  non-financial  goals
         established by the Executive Compensation Committee.

     -   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS. The Executive  Long-Term  Incentive Plan is
         designed to motivate long-term  strategic planning and reward long-term
         corporate  performance,  as measured by Total  Shareholder  Return over
         four-year performance periods commencing each January. At the outset of
         each performance  period,  the executive  officers were given a maximum
         award  opportunity of a stated number of shares of the Company's Common
         Stock.  Sixty  percent  of the award  opportunity  with  respect to the
         four-year  period ending December 31, 1997, was based upon rank among a
         peer group of ten utilities  operating in the same geographic region as
         the Company (Upper Midwest),  and 40 percent of this award  opportunity
         was  based  on rank  among  the S&P 500  companies.  For the  four-year
         performance   period  ending  December  31,  1997,  the  maximum  award
         opportunity  ranged  from  2,000  to  6,000  shares  for the  executive
         officers. Up to one-half of the award may be taken in cash. The maximum
         award opportunity is earned if the Company ranks first or second in the
         peer  group  and at or above  the  90th  percentile  among  the S&P 500
         companies.  The Company must achieve at least a 55th percentile ranking
         among a peer group of ten utilities or a 40th percentile  ranking among
         the S&P 500  companies  for any award to be earned.  For the  four-year
         performance period ending December 31, 1997, awards equal to 63 percent
         of the maximum share opportunity were earned because the Company ranked
         second  among the utility peer group and at the 44th  percentile  among
         the S&P 500  companies.  Effective  for  1996  no  further  performance
         periods were initiated for executives under the discontinued  Executive
         Long-Term Incentive Plan.

         As of January 1996, a new Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation
         Plan was implemented.  Under the new plan, the executive officers other
         than the CEO of the Company  are awarded  stock  options  annually  and
         performance  shares  biennially  having in the  aggregate  target award
         values  ranging  from 25 percent to 35 percent of their base  salaries.
         The value of the award  opportunity  is divided  equally  between stock
         options and  performance  shares.  The stock options will have value if
         the Common Stock price  

                                       10
<PAGE>
         
         appreciates.  The  performance  shares will have value if, in two years
         from the date of grant,  the Total  Shareholder  Return of the  Company
         (or, for business unit executives, other financial measures established
         for  business  units  selected  because of their  correlation  to Total
         Shareholder   Return)   meets  goals   established   by  the  Executive
         Compensation Committee.  These goals are based on the Company's ranking
         against a peer group of 16 diversified  electric utilities  recommended
         by Mercer  and  adopted  by the  Executive  Compensation  Committee  as
         appropriate  comparators.  Dividend  equivalents  accrue on performance
         shares during the performance period and are paid in shares only to the
         extent  performance  goals  are  achieved.  The  maximum  payout is 200
         percent of the target award.  If earned,  50 percent of the performance
         shares will be paid in stock after the end of the  performance  period;
         the  remaining  50  percent  will be paid in  stock,  half on the first
         anniversary of the end of the performance period and half on the second
         anniversary   thereof.  For  the  two-year  performance  period  ending
         December  31,  1997,  the Company  ranked  number 1 among the 16 member
         utility peer group.  As a result,  executives  in the  Corporate  group
         earned  performance  shares  equalling 200 percent of the target award.
         Top  executives  in the  Company's  business  units earned  performance
         shares ranging from 100 percent to 200 percent of target.

         These awards are consistent with the Executive Compensation Committee's
 philosophy  of  linking  a  significant  portion  of  the  executive  officers'
 compensation to the performance of the Company as measured by Total Shareholder
 Return or by other measures of financial performance which correlate with Total
 Shareholder Return.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE BENEFITS

         The Company has  established a Supplemental  Executive  Retirement Plan
(SERP) to  compensate  certain  employees,  including  the  executive  officers,
equitably by replacing  benefits not provided by the Company's  Flexible Benefit
Plan and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan due to government-imposed  limits and
to provide retirement benefits which are competitive with those offered by other
businesses with which the Company competes for executive  talent.  The SERP also
provides   employees   whose  salaries   exceed  the  salary   limitations   for
tax-qualified  plans imposed by the Code with additional benefits such that they
receive in aggregate  the benefits  they would have been entitled to receive had
such limitations not been imposed.

PERQUISITES

         The Company provides various  perquisites to assist selected  executive
officers  in  fulfilling  their  business  responsibilities  in a cost  and time
efficient manner,  to the extent they are consistent with competitive  practice.
Perquisites  provided by the  Company to the named  executive  officers  did not
exceed the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the total  salary and bonus  shown
for them in the Summary  Compensation  Table.  The  perquisites  provided by the
Company were reviewed by the Executive  Compensation Committee and determined to
be reasonable and in line with companies of comparable size.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

         In June 1997 the Board of Directors increased Mr. Russell's annual base
salary 16.9 percent.  Approximately two-thirds of this increase was to align his
base salary with the median in comparably-sized  companies and one-third related
to his  contributions  to the  performance  of the Company.  Under the Company's
Results  Sharing Plan,  Mr. Russell was awarded  $26,969,  or 7.1 percent of his
base salary, based 50 percent on corporate earnings per share performance and 50
percent on average of business unit results sharing awards. Mr. Russell was paid
cash bonuses  totalling  $260,000 and an award of restricted Common Stock valued
at $100,000,  which the Executive  Compensation  Committee  determined  would be
appropriate based upon Mr. Russell's  contributions to the Company's performance
in 1996 and 1997.  The  restricted  stock award vests on January 2, 2000.  Under
Minnesota  Power's Annual Incentive Plan, for the Company's  performance in 1997
Mr.  Russell  earned an award of $413,820,  or 108.9 percent of his base salary,
based  on a  formula  established  in  advance  by  the  Executive  Compensation
Committee which rewarded Mr. Russell, as well as other executive officers in the
Corporate group, for achieving 1997 earnings per share results above targets, as
well as for achievement of non-financial goals, all established by the Executive
Compensation  Committee.  Earnings  per  share  was  adopted  as  a  measure  of
performance  because  it is related to Total  Shareholder  Return.  Shareholders
realized a Total  Shareholder  Return on their investment in the Company of 68.8
percent in 1997.

                                       11
<PAGE>                                

         Mr. Russell's  compensation  plan also contains elements which motivate
him to focus on the  longer-term performance of the Company. For the four-year
performance period ending December 31, 1997, under the discontinued Executive
Long-Term Incentive Plan, Mr. Russell earned  2,756  shares of Common  Stock, 
representing 63 percent of the maximum award opportunity,  because the Company's
Total Shareholder Return ranked second among the peer group of 10 regional 
utilities and at the 44th percentile  among the S&P 500 companies.  Effective
January 1996, no further  performance  periods were  initiated  under the 
discontinued  plan,  and a new  Executive  Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
was implemented.  Under the new plan, Mr. Russell is awarded annual target
opportunities with an average value equal to 55 percent of his base salary. This
value is divided  equally  between stock options  awarded annually  and 
performance  shares  awarded in even  numbered  years.  The stock options become
fully  exercisable in 2 years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The
options will have value if the Company's stock price  appreciates. The 
performance  shares awarded have target value if, in two years from the date of
grant, the Total  Shareholder  Return realized by Company shareholders is at the
50th  percentile  of a peer  group  of 16  diversified  electric  utilities
recommended  by Mercer and adopted by the  Executive  Compensation  Committee as
appropriate comparators. For the two-year performance period ending December 31,
1997, the Company's  shareholders  realized a Total  Shareholder  Return of 76.1
percent,  ranking  the Company  number 1 among the peer group of 16  diversified
electric  utilities,  and resulting in a maximum payout to Mr. Russell under the
plan of 7,163 shares of Minnesota Power Common Stock.

         To recruit Mr. Russell from general industry and retain his services at
Minnesota Power, the Executive  Compensation Committee has endeavored to provide
Mr. Russell with a compensation  package that is halfway  between the midpoints
of  compensation  paid by electric  utilities and  compensation  paid by general
industrial  companies  the  approximate  size of the Company.  The  Compensation
Committee has designed Mr. Russell's compensation package to provide substantial
incentive to achieve and exceed the Board's Total  Shareholder  Return goals for
the Company's shareholders.

Larex Economic Development Project

         In 1995 Minnesota Power began developing plans for an energy park to be
located on its property  adjacent to its Boswell Energy Center in Cohasset,  MN.
The  first  tenant  of the  energy  park was  Larex  International,  Inc.  Larex
developed a process to extract from  certain  tree  species a substance  that is
used in a  variety  of  commercial  applications.  Minnesota  Power,  through  a
subsidiary,  entered into a contract to pay M. A. Mortenson Company $1.3 million
for  construction  of the  buildings  to be occupied by Larex,  and leased these
buildings  to Larex  until the Iron Range  Resources  and  Rehabilitation  Board
(IRRRB),  a local  economic  development  agency,  purchased the buildings  from
Minnesota  Power's  subsidiary for an amount equal to the cost of  construction.
The subsidiary  then assigned the building lease to the IRRRB.  Minnesota  Power
has entered into a separate  ground lease with Larex at an economic  development
rate  which  Minnesota  Power will  offer to other  tenants of the energy  park.
Minnesota  Power has also provided  financing to Larex in the amount of $200,000
under the customary terms of Minnesota  Power's  Economic  Development  Loan
Program.  This financing was used to purchase equipment in which Minnesota Power
has  retained  a  security  interest.   Larex  is  providing  quality  jobs  and
represented an important first step in the development of the energy park.

         Larex was founded in 1993 by Medical  Innovation Fund II of Minneapolis
and Northeast  Ventures of Duluth.  To date,  Larex's  owners have invested $8.6
million  in Larex as  follows:  Medical  Innovation  Fund II has  invested  $3.5
million and holds 48.8  percent of all stock  currently  outstanding;  Northeast
Ventures has invested $1 million and holds 15 percent of the currently issued
and outstanding stock; and the remaining investment and stock is held by various
individuals and entities, including Larex International  Investors Ltd. (LII), a
partnership
                                       12

<PAGE>

of which Kolya Management  Company is the general  partner.  LII has invested
$1.1 million.  Medical Innovation Fund II, Northeast Ventures, and LII, in
addition to certain other  investors in Larex,  have received  warrant rights
based on their respective  participation in specific periodic financing activity
in Larex.

         Minnesota Power director Robert  Nickoloff  serves as a General Partner
of Medical Innovation  Partners II, possessing a 20 percent ownership  interest.
Medical Innovation Partners II is the general partner of Medical Innovation Fund
II. In addition,  Mr.  Nickoloff  serves on the boards of directors of Northeast
Ventures and Larex.  Northeast Ventures,  together with its affiliate Iron Range
Ventures,  is a $10 million  venture  capital  fund  investing  in  northeastern
Minnesota. Minnesota Power purchased a 21 percent interest in Northeast Ventures
for $1  million  in 1989 at a time  when  there  were no  relationships  between
Northeast Ventures and Minnesota Power or its directors or employees.  Minnesota
Power invested in Northeast Ventures as an economic development contribution and
agreed that it would not withdraw its investment. Mr. Gregory Sandbulte, the son
of Arend  Sandbulte,  former  Minnesota Power Chairman,  CEO and President,  and
current director, is currently president of Northeast Ventures and a director of
Larex. Mr. Nick Smith serves as chairman and CEO of Northeast Ventures, and is a
member of the  Minnesota  Power  and Larex  boards  of  directors.  Mr.  Gregory
Sandbulte  and Mr.  Smith,  along  with a  third  party,  are  owners  of  Kolya
Management  Company,  which is a general  partner  of and  holds a 5  percent
ownership interest in LII. Mr. Bo Nickoloff, the son of Mr. Robert Nickoloff, is
an employee of Larex.

MINNESOTA POWER COMMON STOCK PERFORMANCE

         The following graph compares the Company's cumulative Total Shareholder
Return on its Common Stock with the  cumulative  return of the S&P 500 Index and
the S&P Utilities Index, a capitalization-weighted  index of 26 stocks, which is
designed to measure the performance of the electric power utility company sector
of the S&P 500 Index.  The S&P 500 Index is a  capitalization-weighted  index of
500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through
changes  in the  aggregate  market  value of 500 stocks  representing  all major
industries.  Because  this  composite  index  has a  broad  industry  base,  its
performance may not closely track that of a composite index comprised  solely of
electric  utilities.  The calculations  assume a $100 investment on December 31,
1992 and reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date.

               ITEM NO. 2 - APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The  Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  has
recommended the appointment of Price  Waterhouse LLP as independent  accountants
for the  Company  for the year  1998.  Price  Waterhouse  has  acted in the same
capacity since October 1963.
         
         A  representative  of the accounting firm will be present at the Annual
Meeting of  Shareholders,  will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or
she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

         In  connection  with the 1997  audit,  Price  Waterhouse  reviewed  the
Company's annual report, examined the related financial statements, and reviewed
interim  financial  statements  and certain of the  Company's  filings  with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The  Board  of  Directors   recommends  a  vote  "FOR"   approving  the
appointment of Price  Waterhouse as the Company's  independent  accountants  for
1998.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTANTS

         On  September  3, 1996  the Board of  Directors  of ADESA  Corporation
resolved to engage Price Waterhouse LLP as independent accountants for ADESA for
the year ending December 31, 1996  and dismiss  Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) as such
independent accountants. This change was effected for purposes of administrative
efficiency and cost  effectiveness  following the purchase by Minnesota Power of
the remaining 17 percent minority  interest in ADESA in August 1996.  During the
two fiscal years ending December 31, 1995,  and the  subsequent  interim  period
through  September 3, 1996, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matters
of accounting  principles  or  practices,  financial  statement  disclosure,  or
auditing scope or procedures  which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y,
would have  caused  E&Y to make  reference  to the  matter in their  report. E&Y
reports on ADESA's financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31,
1994  and  six-month  periods ending June 30,  1995  and  December  31,  1995
contained no adverse  opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or
modified as to uncertainty or audit scope. E&Y's letter dated September 5, 1996
addressed to the  Securities and Exchange  Commission, stated it agreed with the
above statements.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITEM NO. 3 - PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE COMPANY
     NAME FROM "MINNESOTA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY" TO "MINNESOTA POWER, INC."
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The  Board  of  Directors  proposes  that  the  Company's  Articles  of
Incorporation be amended to change the Company's legal name from Minnesota Power
& Light Company to Minnesota  Power,  Inc. The proposed new name  recognizes our
transition  from  a  traditional  regional  electric  utility  to a  diversified
corporation  serving a broad range of customers  across North  America.  The new
name builds  logically  from our current  identity and  preserves  our Minnesota
heritage.

         The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the proposed amendment.

  ITEM NO. 4 - PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE
                        AMOUNT OF AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The Board of Directors of the Company  recommends that the shareholders
approve an  amendment  to the first  paragraph  of Article III of the  Company's
Restated  Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized  shares
of Common Stock from  65,000,000  to  130,000,000.  The proposed  amendment  was
unanimously  approved  by the Board of  Directors  at its meeting on January 27,
1998. As of December 31, 1997,  33,554,625  shares of the Company's Common Stock
were issued and  outstanding,  and 31,445,375  shares were  unissued,  including
7,117,154 shares reserved and available for issuance to satisfy the requirements
of the Company's stock plans. The Board of Directors will have full authority to
issue the entire amount of additional authorized, but unissued, Common Stock for
such proper  corporate  purposes and on such terms as it may  determine  without
further  action on the part of the  shareholders.  However,  any such  issuances
would  be  subject  to the  requirements  of  applicable  law,  governmental  or
regulatory bodies and of any exchange on which any securities of the Company may
be listed. The additional shares of Common Stock, if authorized,  would have the
same rights and privileges as the shares of Common Stock presently  outstanding.
The  Company's  Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  provide that the shares of
Common  Stock of the  Company  do not  carry  preemptive  rights.  The  Board of
Directors  believes  that the  increase  in the number of  authorized  shares of
Common Stock will be advantageous to the Company and its shareholders because it
will  provide  the Company  with added  flexibility  in  effecting  financings,
acquisitions, stock splits,  stock  dividends,  stock distributions and other
transactions involving the use of stock. The Company has no present intention to
issue any of the newly authorized  shares of Common Stock.  Except for issuances
of the Common  Stock which  may be made in  connection  with  the  Company's 
dividend reinvestment plan, the long-term incentive plans and the supplemental 
retirement plan, neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors has 
entered into any understandings,  agreements, plans or discussions regarding the
issuance and sale of additional shares of Common Stock.

         The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the proposed amendment.

                                 OTHER BUSINESS

         The  Board  of  Directors  does not know of any  other  business  to be
presented at the meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the
meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy card
to vote  pursuant  to the  proxies in  accordance  with their  judgment  in such

                            best judgement of the Proxies. The Board of
                            Directors recommends a vote "FOR" each of the listed
                            proposals. This Proxy is solicited on behalf of the
                            Board of Directors of Minnesota Power and may be
                            revoked prior to its exercise. Please mark, sign,
                            date and return this Proxy card using the enclosed 
                            envelope. Shares cannot be voted unless this Proxy
                            card is signed and returned, or other specific
                            arrangements are made to have the shares represented
                            at the meeting. By returning your Proxy promptly,
                            you may help save the costs of additional Proxy 
                            solicitations.
