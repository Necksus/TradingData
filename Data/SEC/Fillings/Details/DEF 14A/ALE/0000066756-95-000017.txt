                    ITEM NO. 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     It is intended that the accompanying Proxy will be voted for each of the 
nominees listed below for director to serve until the next Annual Meeting of 
Shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. In case any 
such nominee should become unavailable to accept nomination or election for 
any reason, the Proxies may use discretionary authority to vote pursuant to 
the Proxy for a substitute, or the Board of Directors may reduce the number 
of directors, unless the inability to serve is believed to be temporary.  In 
this latter case, the accompanying Proxy will be voted for the nominee named, 
but such nominee, if elected, will not serve until he or she is able to do 
so.  Management has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be 
unable to serve if elected to office.
     The directors standing for election are presented on the following 
pages.

Board and Committee Meetings in 1994

     During 1994, the Board of Directors held nine meetings. In the intervals 
between meetings of the Board, an Executive Committee is authorized to 
exercise the authority of the Board. The Executive Committee, which held two 
meetings during 1994, provides oversight of corporate financial matters and 
performs the functions of a nominating committee. Shareholders may recommend 
nominees for director to the Executive Committee by addressing the Corporate 
Secretary of the Company, 30 West Superior Street, Duluth, Minnesota 55802. 
The Audit Committee, which held three meetings in 1994, recommends the 
selection of independent accountants, reviews and evaluates the Company's 
accounting and financial practices, and reviews and recommends approval of 
the annual audit report. The Executive Compensation Committee, which held 
four meetings in 1994, ensures that compensation and benefit arrangements for 
Company officers and other key executives are equitable, competitive with the 
marketplace, and consistent with corporate objectives. The Electric Utility 
Operations Committee, which held two meetings in 1994, provides oversight of 
the Electric Utility Operations of the Company. All directors attended 75 
percent or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of Directors 
and applicable committee meetings in 1994.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

     Director Robert S. Mars, Jr. is Chairman of W.P.&R.S. Mars Company, an 
industrial equipment and supply firm, and President of its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Conveyor Belt Service, Inc., a conveyor belt maintenance and 
repair firm. The Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of 
business in 1994 purchased $141,793 worth of tools, equipment, and repair 
services from said companies. Some of these tools, equipment, and repair 
services were purchased pursuant to competitive bids, and others were 
purchased directly from inventory of the companies as required. It is the 
opinion of the Company that such purchases were made at prices that were 
competitive with others in this area.
     In 1994 Lehigh Corporation, a second tier subsidiary in which the 
Company holds an 80 percent ownership interest, sold Florida real estate 
interests to James D. Hull who is a brother of Director Paula F. McQueen. The 
price for Mr. Hull's undivided 50 percent ownership interest in this real 
estate was $911,000. Lehigh Corporation loaned Mr. Hull and the other buyer 
approximately one-half of the purchase price with interest at 6.5 percent per 
annum, accepting a mortgage on the real estate as security. The loan must be 
repaid in full on July 15, 2001. It is the opinion of the Company that this 
real estate was sold at market price.
     Director Charles A. Russell is Chairman and CEO of Norwest Bank 
Minnesota, Duluth N.A. with which the Company has banking relationships and 
loan commitments under which the Company is required to pay certain fees or 
maintain compensating balances, although during 1994 Norwest did not hold 
notes of the Company for loans pursuant to these arrangements. Additionally, 
Reach All Partnership, in which the Company has an 82 1/2 percent ownership 
interest through its subsidiaries, has a working capital line of credit with 
Norwest under which $3.8 million is outstanding, with interest payable at 
prime rate plus 2 1/2 percent per annum. It is the opinion of the Company 
that the financial arrangements with Norwest were entered into at market 
rates.

     <F1>Represents the highest annualized average compensation (salary and 
bonus) received for 48 consecutive months during the employee's last 15 years 
of service with the Company. For determination of the pension benefit, the 
48-month period for highest average salary may be different from the 48-month 
period of highest aggregate bonus compensation.  
</FN>
</TABLE>
     Retirement benefit amounts shown are in the form of a straight-life 
annuity to the employee and are based on amounts listed in the Summary 
Compensation Table under the headings Salary and Bonus. Retirement benefit 
amounts shown are not subject to any deduction for Social Security or other 
offset amounts. The Retirement Plan provides that the benefit amount at 
retirement is subject to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living 
increases to a maximum adjustment of 3 percent per year. As of December 31, 
1994, the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table had the 
following number of years of credited service under the plan: Arend J. 
Sandbulte - 30 years, Robert D. Edwards - 18 years, Jack R. McDonald - 27 
years, Bert T. Phillips - 18 years, and Allen D. Harmon - 16 years.
     With certain exceptions, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(Code), presently restricts the aggregate amount of annual pension which may 
be paid to an employee under the Retirement Plan to $120,000, which amount is 
subject to adjustment in future years to reflect cost of living increases. 
The Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides for 
supplemental payments by the Company to eligible executives (including the 
executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table) in amounts 
sufficient to maintain total retirement benefits upon retirement at a level 
which would have been provided by the Retirement Plan if benefits were not 
restricted by the Code.

Compensation of Directors

     Employee directors receive no additional compensation for their services 
as directors. In 1994, the Company paid each director an annual retainer fee 
of $4,000 and 500 shares of Common Stock, except that two directors newly 
elected in 1994 received an annual retainer of $2,000 and 500 shares of 
Common Stock. In addition, each director was paid $750 for each Board, 
Committee, and subsidiary board meeting attended, except that $450 was paid 
for attendance at a second meeting held the same day as
                                       8
<PAGE>
another meeting. Twice in 1994 a Board meeting was adjourned and reconvened the
following day, at which times a meeting fee was paid for each day of meeting.
Each director who is the Chairman of a Committee received an additional $150
for each Committee meeting attended. A $225 fee was paid for conference call 
meetings. Directors may elect to defer all or a part of the cash portion of 
their retainer fees and meeting fees. The shares of Common Stock paid to 
directors during 1994 had an average market price of $30.00 per share. The 
Company also provides life insurance of $5,000 on the life of each director. 
The Minnesota Power Director Stock Plan, which shareholders are asked to 
approve under Item No. 3 below, formalizes, but does not increase, the current 
annual retainer payment plan, part of which is paid in Common Stock.
     The Board has a Long-Term Incentive Plan which provides a compensation 
program similar to that provided to the executive officers by the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (see page 12), except that the directors' maximum award 
opportunity is 600 shares of Common Stock every other year. The plan awards 
Common Stock to the directors if, over a four-year period commencing with 
each even numbered year, the total return to the Company's shareholders (that 
is, stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) exceeds the median 
total return achieved by a pre-selected group of ten comparable utilities and 
by the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500). The size of the award varies 
depending upon the extent to which the Company's total return exceeds the 
median total returns. No awards are granted to directors if Company results 
are below both median total returns. The first awards under the plan may be 
made in 1996 based on the four-year period ending December 31, 1995.

Report of Board Executive Compensation Committee on Executive Compensation

     Described below are the compensation policies of the Executive 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors with respect to the 
executive officers of the Company. Composed entirely of independent outside 
directors, the Executive Compensation Committee is responsible for 
recommending to the Board the policies which govern the executive 
compensation program of the Company and for administering those policies.  To 
assist the Executive Compensation Committee in connection with the 
performance of such responsibilities, the Board has retained the services of 
Hewitt Associates LLC, a benefits and compensation consulting firm.  Hewitt 
Associates has been retained in this capacity since 1986.
     The role of the executive compensation program is to help Minnesota 
Power achieve its corporate goals by motivating performance, rewarding 
positive results, and encouraging teamwork. Focusing on these three goals, 
the Executive Compensation Committee adopted revisions to the executive 
compensation program effective for 1993 and additional revisions effective 
for 1994 to place greater emphasis on performance-based compensation and 
relatively less emphasis on base salary. Recognizing that the potential 
impact an individual employee has on the attainment of corporate goals tends 
to increase at higher levels within the Company, the executive compensation 
program provides greater variability in compensating individuals based on 
results achieved as their levels within the Company rise. In other words, 
individuals with the greatest potential impact on achieving the stated goals 
have the greatest amount to gain when goals are achieved and the greatest 
amount at risk when goals are not achieved. The Company has no policy 
regarding the deductibility of qualifying compensation paid to executive 
officers under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended.
     The program also recognizes that, in order to attract and retain 
exceptional executive talent, compensation must be competitive in the 
national market when measured against comparable firms within that market.  
For those executives engaged primarily or exclusively in electric utility 
operations, the relevant market for purposes of  comparison is other electric 
utilities throughout the country which, on average, are comparable in size to 
Minnesota Power.  For those executives engaged substantially in the Company's 
diversification activities, the appropriate market for purposes of comparison 
includes both electric utilities and general industry.  Comparisons with the 
general industry market allow recognition of skills required in 
diversification activities and compensation levels of executives in other 
industries.
     To determine market levels of compensation for executive officers, the 
Executive Compensation Committee relied upon comparative information provided 
by Hewitt Associates. Hewitt selected 15 electric utilities and 25 industrial 
companies as appropriate for market compensation comparison, primarily 
because they are approximately the same size as the Company as measured by 
sales revenue.
     The Executive Compensation Committee determined that executive base 
salary plus additional performance-based compensation at the threshold level 
should approximate the midpoint of the range of base salary plus total 
performance-based compensation in the appropriate market. The threshold level 
of results represents average corporate performance as measured under the 
Company's performance-based
                                         10
<PAGE>

compensation plans. In 1994, executive compensation actually paid by the 
Company fell within the midrange of executive compensation paid by the 
comparable companies.
     As described below, executive officers of the Company receive a 
compensation package which consists of four basic elements: base salary, 
performance-based compensation, supplemental executive benefits, and 
perquisites.

Base Salary

     Base salary is set at a level so that, if the threshold level of 
performance is achieved under the performance-based plans as described below, 
executive officers' total compensation, including amounts paid under each of 
the performance-based compensation plans, will be near the midpoint of market 
compensation as described in the preceding three paragraphs. In 1994 the base 
salaries of the executive officers were not increased. However, as discussed 
below, these officers were given an additional award opportunity under the 
Annual Incentive Plan. 

Performance-Based Compensation

     Performance-based compensation consists of the following components: 
Results Sharing, Individual Strategic Goals, the Annual Incentive Plan, and 
the Long-Term Incentive Plan. Performance goals are approved in advance by 
the Executive Compensation Committee and the Board. A threshold level of 
performance under the performance-based plans represents average corporate 
performance, as determined by the Executive Compensation Committee. With 
threshold performance, executive compensation will be near the midpoint of 
the relevant market. If no performance awards are earned, compensation of the 
Company's executive officers will be near the fortieth percentile of the 
market, while performance at increments above the threshold level will result 
in total compensation above the midpoint of the market.
     The Company's performance-based compensation plans include:

.    Results Sharing.  The Results Sharing award opportunity rewards 
     annual performance of the executive's responsibility area as well as 
     overall corporate performance. Results Sharing awards are available to all 
     employees on the same percentage of pay basis and are intended to focus 
     employee attention on both responsibility area performance and corporate 
     performance generally. If overall corporate performance goals with respect 
     to earnings per share and operating income are met or exceeded, then a 
     bonus of up to 15 percent of salary may be earned depending upon (i) 
     the degree to which target earnings per share and operating income 
     levels are exceeded, and (ii) achievement of objectively measurable 
     business unit goals. Threshold performance will result in an award of 
     2.5 percent of base salary under this plan. In 1994, Results Sharing 
     awards averaging 3.1 percent of base pay were earned by executive officers 
     (not including the CEO) with responsibility for the Company's electric, 
     water, and real estate  business units because operating income and other 
     business unit goals were exceeded.

.    Individual Strategic Goals.  The Executive Compensation Committee 
     established a set of objectively measurable "Strategic Goals" to be 
     accomplished in 1994 for each executive officer named in the Summary 
     Compensation Table plus one additional
                                      11
<PAGE>
     executive officer. The Strategic Goals for a particular officer relate
     to the performance of the business unit within the scope of
     responsibility of that officer. The award opportunity for the CEO under
     this plan is 15 percent of base salary if all of the CEO's goals are
     achieved. The other executive officers may be awarded generally up to
     10 percent of base salary. Threshold performance under this plan will
     result in payment of an award equal to 6 percent of the CEO's base salary
     and 4 percent of base salary of the other executive officers. In 1994 five
     executive officers, not including the CEO, earned an award collectively
     amounting to 9.0 percent of base salary for accomplishment of Strategic
     Goals in 1994. Over half of this collective amount was paid to one
     executive officer for exceeding earnings goals of the Company's water
     utility operations.

.    Annual Incentive Plan. The Annual Incentive Plan is intended to 
     focus executive attention on superior performance of the Company in 
     comparison to other companies. The Annual Incentive Plan rewards near-term 
     corporate performance as measured by the Company's ranking using two- and 
     three-year averaging periods, in relation to (i) a peer group of ten 
     electric utility companies operating in the same geographic region as the 
     Company (Upper Midwest) and (ii) the companies listed in the S&P 500 
     Index. The Company's performance is compared to the peer group with 
     respect to  return on average common equity, annual rate of growth in 
     operating and maintenance expenses per kilowatt-hour sold, customer cost 
     per kilowatt-hour sold, and the after-tax interest and preferred dividend 
     coverage ratio. The Company's performance with respect to total 
     shareholder return (that is, stock price appreciation plus reinvested 
     dividends) is compared with the peer group (60 percent weighting) and to 
     the S&P 500 companies (40 percent weighting). Each executive officer is 
     preassigned a percentage weighting of each of these performance measures
     based on the officer's areas of responsibility. Award opportunities 
     relating to the above measures range from 5 percent of the base salary of 
     lower level executive officers to 50 percent of the base salary of the 
     CEO.  An additional award opportunity of up to 10 percent of base salary 
     is earned if objectively measurable individual goals approved by the 
     Executive Compensation Committee are accomplished. The full award 
     opportunity is earned if (i) Company performance equals or exceeds the 
     eightieth percentile for all performance measures when measured against 
     performance of both the peer group utilities and the S&P 500 companies, 
     and (ii) the executive officer's individual goals are achieved. The 
     threshold level of performance is achieved if the Company's performance 
     falls between the fortieth and the forty-ninth percentile as measured 
     against the performance of the peer group of utilities and the S&P 500. 
     The executive officers (not including the CEO) earned an average award 
     equal to 8 percent of base salary under this plan in 1994 as a result of 
     the financial performance of the electric, water, and real estate business
     units.

.    Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Long-Term Incentive Plan is designed to 
     motivate long-term strategic planning and reward long-term corporate 
     performance, as measured by total shareholder return. In January of each 
     year the executive officers are given a maximum award opportunity of a 
     stated number of shares of the Company's Common Stock based upon the 
     Company's performance over a four-year performance period. Sixty percent 
     of the award opportunity is based upon rank among a peer group of ten 
     utilities operating in the same geographic region as
                                         12
<PAGE>
     the Company (Upper Midwest), and 40 percent of the award opportunity is 
     based on rank among the S&P 500 companies. For the four-year performance 
     period ending December 31, 1994, the maximum award opportunity was 6,000 
     shares for the CEO. The maximum award ranged from 2,000 to 5,000 shares 
     for the other executive officers. The maximum award opportunity is earned 
     if the Company ranks first or second in the peer group and at or above the 
     ninetieth percentile among the S&P 500 companies. A threshold award equal 
     to 20 percent of the maximum award opportunity is earned if, over the 
     four-year period, the Company achieves at least a fifty-fifth percentile 
     ranking among a peer group of utilities and a fiftieth percentile ranking 
     among the S&P 500 companies. For the four-year performance period ending 
     December 31, 1994, no awards were earned because the Company did not 
     achieve total shareholder return required for a payout under the plan.

Supplemental Executive Benefits 

     The Company has established a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
(SERP) to treat employees, including the executive officers, equitably by 
replacing benefits not provided by the Company's Flexible Benefit Plan and 
the Employee Stock Ownership Plan due to government-imposed limits and to 
provide retirement benefits which are competitive with those offered by other 
businesses with which the Company competes for managerial talent.  The SERP 
also provides employees whose salaries exceed the salary limitations for tax-
qualified plans imposed by the Code with additional benefits such that they 
receive in aggregate the benefits they would have been entitled to receive 
had such limitations not been imposed. 
     The Company has also adopted Executive Investment Plans whereby 
executive officers may enter into agreements with the Company to irrevocably 
defer a portion of their compensation until after termination of service, 
retirement, or death. The Executive Investment Plans are non-qualified 
deferred compensation plans, under which benefits result wholly from deferred 
compensation. 

Perquisites

     The Company provides various perquisites to assist selected executive 
officers in fulfilling their business responsibilities in a cost- and time-
efficient manner, to the extent they are consistent with competitive 
practice. Perquisites provided by the Company to the named executive officers 
did not exceed the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the total salary and 
bonus shown for them in the Summary Compensation Table. The perquisites 
provided by the Company were reviewed by the Executive Compensation Committee 
and determined to be reasonable and in line with electric utility companies 
of comparable size.

Chief Executive Officer Compensation

     Consistent with the Compensation Committee's philosophy of linking 
greater portions of top executive pay to meeting the financial and strategic 
goals of the Company, the Executive Compensation Committee did not increase 
the CEO's base salary for 1994, but instead maintained his salary at its 1993 
level and amended the Annual Incentive Plan to provide the CEO an opportunity 
to earn an award of up to 10 percent of his base salary upon achievement of 
1994 earnings goals established by the Executive Compensation Committee. Under
the Company's Results Sharing Plan, the CEO was
                                           13
<PAGE>
awarded $13,821, or 3.9 percent of his base salary, because operating income 
and other business unit goals were exceeded by the Company's electric, water, 
and real estate business units. For accomplishment of Individual Strategic 
Goals assigned to him in 1994 by the Executive Compensation Committee, the 
CEO was awarded $25,165, or 7 percent of his base salary, for achievement of 
an earnings goal at the Company's Florida water utility. Under the Annual 
Incentive Plan, the CEO earned $6,967, or 1.9 percent of base salary in 1994, 
for achievement of electric, water, and real estate business unit earnings 
goals. No award was earned in 1994 by the CEO under the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan because the Company did not achieve the total shareholder return 
required for payout under the plan.

     The members of the Executive Compensation Committee are Robert S. 
Nickoloff, Chairman, Dennis E. Evans, Charles A. Russell, and Donald C. 
Wegmiller. 
     Director Charles A. Russell is Chairman and CEO of Norwest Bank 
Minnesota, Duluth N.A. with which the Company has banking relationships and 
loan commitments under which the Company is required to pay certain fees or 
maintain compensating balances, although during 1994 Norwest did not hold 
notes of the Company for loans pursuant to these arrangements. Additionally, 
Reach All Partnership, in which the Company has an 82 1/2 percent ownership 
interest through its subsidiaries, has a working capital line of credit with 
Norwest under which $3.8 million is outstanding, with interest payable at 
prime rate plus 2 1/2 percent per annum. It is the opinion of the Company 
that the financial arrangements with Norwest were entered into at market 
rates.

               ITEM NO. 2 - APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has 
recommended the appointment of Price Waterhouse as independent accountants 
for the Company for the year 1995.  Price Waterhouse LLP has acted in the 
same capacity since October 1963.
     A representative of the accounting firm will be present at the Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders, will have an opportunity to make a statement if he 
or she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
     In connection with the 1994 audit, Price Waterhouse reviewed the 
Company's annual report, examined the related financial statements, and 
reviewed interim financial statements and certain of the Company's filings 
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission.    
     The Board of Directors recommends a vote in favor of the appointment of 
Price Waterhouse as the Company's independent accountants for 1995.

                    ITEM NO. 3 - RECOMMENDED APPROVAL OF THE
                       Minnesota Power Director Stock Plan  
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     At its meeting on January 25, 1995, the Board of Directors adopted a 
Director Stock Plan (the "Plan"), subject to ratification by the 
shareholders. The Plan formalizes the Company's current practice of annually 
paying each director 500 shares of Common Stock as part of the director's 
annual retainer. The complete text of the Plan is set forth in Exhibit "A" 
hereto. The following is a summary of the material features of the Plan and 
is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit "A".
     The purpose of the Plan is to provide ownership of Minnesota Power 
Common Stock to members of the Board of Directors in order to improve the 
Company's ability to attract and retain highly qualified individuals to serve 
as directors of the Company and to strengthen the commonality of interest 
between directors and shareholders.
     The Plan provides for each non-employee director to receive a stock 
payment of 500 shares as a portion of the annual retainer payable to such 
director. The first award under the Plan will be made on the first business 
day after the annual meeting of shareholders held May 9, 1995 and subsequent 
awards will be paid on January 31 of each year, provided that newly elected 
or appointed directors will receive their award as soon as practical after 
election or appointment. The Plan also provides each director with the right 
to elect to increase the amount of common stock that will be purchased by 
reducing the cash portion of the annual retainer. The number of shares to be 
granted and the time when granted may not be changed by the Board more than 
once every six months, or otherwise in contravention of Rule 16b-3 under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
     Shares to be issued under the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares 
of Common Stock, or shares purchased on the open market. The maximum number 
of shares that may be issued under the Plan is 250,000.
There are currently eleven directors of the Company eligible to participate 
in the Plan.

Any Director who declines a Stock Payment must do so in writing prior to the 
performance of any services as a  Director for the Plan Year to which such 
Stock Payment relates.
     D.   No Director shall be required to forfeit or otherwise return any 
shares of Common Stock issued as a Stock Payment pursuant to the Plan 
(including any shares of
                                         18
<PAGE>
Common Stock received as a result of an election under Section VI) 
notwithstanding any change in status of such Director which renders him 
ineligible to continue as a Participant in the Plan.

VI.  Election to Increase Amount of Stock Payment
          For any Plan Year, a Participant may make a written election to 
reduce the cash portion of the Annual Retainer by a specified dollar amount 
and have such amount applied to purchase additional shares of Common Stock of 
the Company. The election shall be made on a form provided by the Committee 
and must be returned to the Committee no later than six months prior to the 
applicable Plan Year. The election form shall state the amount by which the 
Participant desires to reduce the cash portion of the Annual Retainer, which 
shall be applied toward the purchase of Common Stock to be delivered on the 
same date that the Stock Payment is made; provided, however, that no 
fractional shares may be purchased. Cash in lieu of any fractional share 
shall be paid to the Participant. An election shall continue in effect until 
changed or revoked by the Participant. No Participant shall be allowed to 
change or revoke any election for the then current year.

VII. Adjustment for Changes in Capitalization
          If the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company are 
increased, decreased, or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares 
or other securities, or if additional shares or new or different shares or 
other securities are distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock 
or other securities, through merger, consolidation, sale of all or 
substantially all of the property of the Company, reorganization or 
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse 
stock split, combinations of shares, rights offering, distribution of assets 
or other distribution with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other 
securities or other change in the corporate structure or shares of Common 
Stock, the number of shares to be granted annually, the maximum number of 
shares and/or the kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan shall be 
appropriately adjusted by the Committee. Any determination by the Committee 
as to any such adjustment will be final, binding, and conclusive. The maximum 
number of shares issuable under the Plan as a result of any such adjustment 
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.

VIII.     Amendment and Termination of Plan
     A.   The Board will have the power, in its discretion, to amend, suspend 
or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no amendment which 
requires shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply 
with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, including any successor to such Rule, 
shall be effective unless such amendment shall be approved by the requisite 
vote of the shareholders of the Company entitled to vote thereon.
     B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of the Plan that 
either states the amount and price of securities to be issued under the Plan 
and specifies the price and timing of such issuances, or sets forth a formula 
that determines the amount, price, and timing of such issuances, shall not be
amended more than once every six months, other than to comport with changes in
the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the
rules thereunder.
                                        19

IX.  Effective Date and Duration of the Plan
          The Plan will become effective upon the Effective Date, and shall 
remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board of Directors to terminate 
the Plan at any time pursuant to Section VIII, until all shares subject to 
the Plan have been purchased or acquired according to the Plan's provisions.

X.   Miscellaneous Provisions

     A.   Continuation of Directors in Same Status

     Nothing in the Plan or any action taken pursuant to the Plan shall be 
construed as creating or constituting evidence of any agreement or 
understanding, express or implied, that the Company will retain a Director as 
a director or in any other capacity for any period of time or at a particular 
retainer or other rate of compensation, as conferring upon any Participant 
any legal or other right to continue as a director or in any other capacity, 
or as limiting, interfering with or otherwise affecting the right of the 
Company to terminate a Participant in his capacity as a director or otherwise 
at any time for any reason, with or without cause, and without regard to the 
effect that such termination might have upon him as a Participant under the 
Plan.

     B.   Compliance with Government Regulations

     Neither the Plan nor the Company shall be obligated to issue any shares 
of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan at any time unless and until all 
applicable requirements imposed by any federal and state securities and other 
laws, rules and regulations, by any regulatory agencies or by any stock 
exchanges upon which the Common Stock may be listed have been fully met. As a 
condition precedent to any issuance of shares of Common Stock and delivery of 
certificates evidencing such shares pursuant to the Plan, the Board or the 
Committee may require a Participant to take any such action and to make any 
such covenants, agreements, and representations as the Board or the Committee, 
as the case may be, in its discretion deems necessary or advisable to ensure 
compliance with such requirements. The Company shall in no event be obligated 
to register the shares of Common Stock deliverable under the Plan pursuant to 
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify or register such shares 
under any securities laws of any state upon their issuance under the Plan or at 
any time thereafter, or to take any other action in order to cause the issuance 
and delivery of such shares under the Plan or any subsequent offer, sale, or 
other transfer of such shares to comply with any such law, regulation, or 
requirement. Participants are responsible for complying with all applicable 
federal and state securities and other laws, rules, and regulations in 
connection with any offer, sale, or other transfer of the shares of Common 
Stock issued under the Plan or any interest therein including, without 
limitation, compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities 
Act of 1933 as amended (unless an exception therefrom is available) or with 
the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated thereunder, if applicable, or any 
successor provisions. Certificates for shares of Common Stock may be legended 
as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

     C.   Nontransferability of Rights

     No Participant shall have the right to assign the right to receive any 
Stock Payment or any other right or interest under the Plan, contingent or 
otherwise, or to
                                        20
<PAGE>
cause or permit any encumbrance, pledge, or charge of any nature to be imposed
on any such Stock Payment (prior to the issuance of stock certificates 
evidencing such Stock Payment) or any such right or interest.

     D.   Severability

     In the event that any provision of the Plan is held invalid, void, or 
unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the 
validity of any other provision of the Plan.

     E.   Governing Law

     To the extent not preempted by federal law, the Plan shall be governed 
by the laws of the state of Minnesota.
