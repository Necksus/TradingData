Item 4.    Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

         On  September  3,  1996 the  Board of  Directors  of ADESA  Corporation
(ADESA), a wholly owned subsidiary of Minnesota Power & Light Company (Minnesota
Power),  resolved to (i) engage Price Waterhouse LLP as independent  accountants
for ADESA for the year ended  December 31, 1996 and (ii)  dismiss  Ernst & Young
LLP as such  independent  accountants.  ADESA is  Minnesota  Power's  automobile
auction business  segment,  which is  headquartered  in  Indianapolis,  Indiana.
Minnesota Power purchased the remaining 17 percent  minority  interest in August
1996.

         During the two fiscal years ended  December 31, 1995 and the subsequent
interim period through September 3, 1996 there were no disagreements  with Ernst
& Young LLP on any matters of  accounting  principles  or  practices,  financial
statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures which, if not resolved to
the  satisfaction  of Ernst & Young LLP would have  caused  Ernst & Young LLP to
make reference to the matter in their report.

         Ernst & Young LLP's  reports on ADESA's  financial  statements  for the
fiscal year ended  December 31, 1994 and six month  periods  ended June 30, 1995
and December 31, 1995 contained no adverse  opinion or disclaimer of opinion and
were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty or audit scope.

         Minnesota  Power  requested  Ernst & Young LLP to  furnish  it a letter
addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements.
Ernst & Young LLP's  letter  dated  September  5, 1996 is filed as Exhibit 16 to
this Form 8-K.
