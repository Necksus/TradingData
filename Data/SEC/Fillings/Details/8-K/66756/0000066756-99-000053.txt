Ref. 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 Page 21. - Third through
Fifth Paragraphs

On December 30, 1999 the  shareholders  of Capital Re  Corporation  (Capital Re)
approved  the merger of Capital Re with ACE  Limited  (ACE) and the  transaction
closed. Each Capital Re share was exchanged for 0.65 ordinary shares of ACE plus
$3.4456 in cash which delivered an approximate  value of $14 for each Capital Re
share.

In exchange for its 7.3 million shares of Capital Re,  Minnesota  Power received
4.7  million  ordinary  shares of ACE and $25.1  million  in cash.  Based on the
December  29,  1999  $16.75  closing  price of ACE,  the total value of proceeds
received was $104.4  million.  Minnesota  Power will record an additional  $12.1
million  non-cash  charge to net income  during  the  fourth  quarter of 1999 to
reflect the final valuation of this  transaction.  This charge combined with the
$24.1 million  non-cash charge recorded in June 1999 will result in a total 1999
charge of $36.2 million to Minnesota  Power's net income.  Minnesota Power owned
20 percent of Capital Re before the merger, and now owns 2 percent of ACE.

Capital Re is a financial guaranty  reinsurance and specialty insurance company.
ACE  through  its  subsidiaries,   provides  a  broad  range  of  insurance  and
reinsurance products for a diverse group of international clients. ACE trades on
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ACL.
