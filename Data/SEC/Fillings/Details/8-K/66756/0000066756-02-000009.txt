                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE which are made in this Form 8-K, in presentations,  in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond the control of ALLETE and may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

       - war and acts of terrorism;

       - prevailing  governmental  policies and  regulatory  actions,  including
         those of the United States Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal
         Energy   Regulatory   Commission,   the  Minnesota   Public   Utilities
         Commission,  the Florida Public Service Commission,  the North Carolina
         Utilities  Commission,  the Public Service  Commission of Wisconsin and
         various county regulators,  about allowed rates of return, industry and
         rate  structure,  acquisition  and  disposal of assets and  facilities,
         operation and construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased
         power and capital investments, and present or prospective wholesale and
         retail competition (including but not limited to transmission costs);

       - economic  and  geographic  factors,  including  political and  economic
         risks;

       - changes  in  and  compliance  with  environmental  and safety  laws and
         policies;

       - weather conditions;

       - population growth rates and demographic patterns;

       - competition for retail and wholesale customers;

       - pricing and transportation of commodities;

       - market demand, including structural market changes;

       - changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

       - changes in project costs;

       - unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

       - capital market conditions;

       - competition for new energy development opportunities; and

       - legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal)and
         settlements that influence the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                         ALLETE POSTS SOLID 2001 RESULTS
                         -------------------------------

(Duluth,  Minn.)--ALLETE,  Inc.  (NYSE:  ALE) today  announced  earnings, before
one-time events, of 37 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2001,  compared
with 27 cents for the same  period last year.  Excluding  the  one-time  events,
annual  earnings per share were $1.87,  compared with $1.67 in 2000, an increase
of 12 percent.  The aforementioned  earnings figures exclude a 6 cents per share
exit charge recorded by ALLETE's vehicle transport company in 2001 and a 44 cent
gain in 2000 relating to the company's past investment in ACE Limited.  Reported
earnings per share in 2001, including the one-time events, were 31 cents for the
quarter and $1.81 for the year, compared with 27 cents for the quarter and $2.11
in 2000.

"The strength of our core business  units--energy and automotive services became
evident more than ever in 2001," said David  Gartzke,  chairman,  president  and
chief executive officer of ALLETE.  "Despite economic  adversity both nationally
and regionally, our people weathered the storms and helped us meet or exceed our
growth targets for the year."

In the fourth quarter of 2001,  AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES posted an earnings increase
of $8.6 million over the same period in 2000 due mainly to  acquisitions  and an
increase in the number of vehicles  sold at auction and  financed by  Automotive
Finance  Corporation  (AFC).  For the year,  Automotive  Services net income was
$74.8 million,  a 50 percent increase over 2000,  exceeding the company's stated
growth  goal of 40 percent.  Same-store  earnings  at ADESA  wholesale  auctions
increased  by 13  percent  over  2000  levels as  measured  by  earnings  before
interest,  taxes,  depreciation,  amortization  and lease  expense.  At AFC, the
number of vehicles  financed in 2001 rose to 904,000,  an increase of 14 percent
over 2000.

ENERGY SERVICES  reported  fourth quarter  earnings of $11.4 million,  about the
same as the fourth quarter of 2000.  For the year,  net income  increased to $50
million,  a 16 percent  increase over 2000,  due primarily to increased  margins
from wholesale power marketing and trading.

INVESTMENTS and CORPORATE CHARGES include the investment portfolio, real estate,
emerging  technology  investments and corporate  charges.  For the quarter,  net
income from segment fell by $300,000  compared with 2000.  Earnings in 2001 were
$3.8 million.

ALLETE plans to exit its water business and is entertaining purchase offers from
interested  parties.  This  potential  sale would provide  additional  funds for
ALLETE to aggressively seek new growth initiatives.

Looking ahead to 2002, ALLETE anticipates earnings per share growth of between 8
and 10 percent  over  $1.87,  and 20 percent  net  income  growth in  Automotive
Services.  These projections do not reflect newly mandated changes in accounting
standards.  Taking these changes into account,  ALLETE's growth  projections for
2002 are between 14 and 16 percent, and over 30 percent for Automotive Services.

<F1>   In May 2000  ALLETE,  Inc. sold its  investment in  ACE  Limited  common stock,  which resulted in  an  after-tax gain of
       $30.4  million,  or $0.44 per share.  The ACE shares were received in December 1999 upon  completion of ACE's merger with
       Capital Re Corporation.
<F2>   Discontinued  operations included the operating results  of ALLETE's  Water Services businesses  and  its  auto transport
       company. During the fourth quarter of 2001 ALLETE recognized a $4.4 million, or $0.06 per share, estimated charge to exit
       the auto transport company.
