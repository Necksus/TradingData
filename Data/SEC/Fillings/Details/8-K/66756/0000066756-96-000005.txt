Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations

   Minnesota  Power has  operations  in four  business  segments:  (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
operations,   which  include  water  and  wastewater  services;  (3)  automobile
auctions,  which also include a finance  company and an auto transport  company;
and (4)  investments,  which  include  real estate  operations,  a 22.1%  equity
investment  in a  financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and  a  securities
portfolio.
   Earnings  Per Share.  Earnings  per share of common  stock were $2.16 in 1995
compared  to $2.06  in 1994 and  $2.20  in  1993.  The most  significant  factor
contributing  to the higher earnings in 1995 was the recognition of tax benefits
associated with real estate  operations  which  contributed 52 cents to earnings
per  share.  Of the 52  cents  recognized,  5  cents  is  attributed  to  normal
operations in 1995.  Earnings in 1995 also reflect  increased  electric sales to
industrial customers and other power suppliers,  and the improved performance of
the Company's securities portfolio. Earnings in 1995 were reduced by lower water
sales in Florida and a 14 cent per share loss associated with exiting Reach All,
the  truck-mounted  lifting  equipment  business.  Automobile  auctions  did not
contribute to earnings per share for the six months ended Dec. 31, 1995.
   Major factors  contributing to 1994 earnings  include 42 cents per share from
the  sale of  certain  water  plant  assets  and 13  cents  per  share  from the
recognition  of escrow  funds  associated  with  real  estate  operations.  Poor
securities market conditions,  in addition to a 21 cent per share write-off of a
securities  investment  and  an 11  cent  per  share  loss  from  the  Company's
investment in Reach All,  lowered  earnings in 1994. In 1993 the  recognition of
unbilled revenue and increased sales to other power suppliers helped offset lost
electric revenue from the idling of one of the Company's large power customers.
   Discontinued  operations  include the paper and pulp business  which was sold
in June 1995.  The increase in income from discontinued  operations  reflect 
higher paper and pulp prices in 1995 and 1994. A worldwide  excess paper supply
depressed paper prices in 1993.

Consolidated Financial Review
   Operating  Revenue  and Income.  Electric  operations  operating  revenue was
higher in 1995 than 1994  because  of record kWh  sales.  There  were  increased
retail sales,  higher commercial and residential  rates, and significantly  more
sales to other  power  suppliers.  1994 was lower than 1993  because the Company
recognized $5.1 million of unbilled  revenue and recovered $14.6 million more of
coal contract termination costs in 1993. Also, National, a taconite producer and
major  electric  customer of the Company,  operated all year in 1995,  only four
months in 1994 and seven  months in 1993.  The decrease in kWh sales in 1994 was
offset by $11.1 million of additional revenue from an interim rate increase.
   Water operations  operating  revenue and income was lower in 1995 compared to
1994 due to 15,000 fewer  customers  following  the December 1994 sale of Venice
Gardens' assets. The sale resulted in a $19.1 million gain in 1994. In addition,
1994  included  12 months of  increased  rates,  while 1993  included  only four
months.  Abnormally  high  rainfall in Florida and customer  water  conservation
efforts also lowered operating revenue in 1995 and 1994.
   Automobile  auctions  operating  revenue is included as of July 1, 1995,  the
purchase date of ADESA, the automobile auction business.
   Investments  operating  revenue and income in 1995 reflects  improved results
due to the  record-setting  securities  market.  1994  includes a $10.1  million
write-off of a  securities  investment.  Operating  revenue and income from real
estate  operations  was  lower  in 1995  compared  to 1994 and 1993 due to fewer
commercial land sales and Lehigh's maturing accounts  receivable  portfolio.  In
1994 Lehigh recognized $4.5 million of escrow funds.

   Operating  Expenses.  Fuel and purchased  power  expenses were higher in 1995
than 1994 because of a 13% increase in kWh sold.  Power purchases  increased $17
million  primarily  because of the increased  demand by industrial  customers in
Minnesota  and  also by  neighboring  utilities.  Expenses  were  lower  in 1994
compared to 1993 because the monthly  amortization of coal contract  termination
costs was completed in March 1994. 1994 expenses included  additional  purchased
power to provide  for  unscheduled  outages at  Boswell  and to meet  unexpected
demand from three taconite customers.
   Operations  expenses  were higher in 1995 than 1994 due to the  inclusion  of
ADESA,  scheduled electric  maintenance costs, and increased expenses related to
conservation improvement programs (CIP) and customer services.  Expenses in 1994
were  higher  than  1993  because  of  increased  expense  related  to  CIP  and
unscheduled outages at Boswell.
   Administrative  and general  expenses  were higher in 1995 than 1994 and 1993
due to the  addition  of ADESA and  salary  and  benefit  increases.  Salary and
benefit  increases were tempered by lower payroll costs associated with an early
retirement offering to electric utility employees that were age 53 or older with
10 or more years of service.
   Interest  expense was higher in 1995 than 1994 due to the  addition of ADESA.
Expense  was higher in 1994 than 1993  reflecting  debt  financing  for  capital
expenditures relating to water operations and more commercial paper outstanding.
   Income from equity investments was higher in 1995 compared to 1994 because of
increased  income from Capital Re. This increase was partially  offset by a $6.4
million loss associated with exiting Reach All in 1995. 1994 was lower than 1993
due to a $5.2 million loss at Reach All.
   Income tax expense in 1995  includes  the  recognition  of $18.4  million of 
tax  benefits  associated  with real estate operations.
   Income from  discontinued  operations  includes the operating results and the
$1.5 million net loss on the sale of the paper and pulp business.  Significantly
higher  paper and pulp prices  increased  earnings in 1995 and 1994  compared to
1993.  In June  1995 the  Company  sold the  paper  and pulp  business  for $118
million.


Electric Operations
     Electric operations  generate,  transmit,  distribute and sell electricity.
Minnesota Power provides electricity to 122,000 customers in northern Minnesota,
while the Company's  wholly owned  subsidiary,  Superior Water,  Light and Power
Company,  sells  electricity  to  14,000  customers  and  natural  gas to 11,000
customers,  and provides  water to 10,000  customers in northwestern  Wisconsin.
Another wholly owned  subsidiary,  BNI Coal, owns and operates a lignite mine in
North Dakota. Two electric generating cooperatives,  Minnkota Power Cooperative,
Inc. and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI Coal's production of lignite
coal under contracts extending to 2027.
   Electric  Retail Rates.  Effective June 1, 1995, the MPUC  authorized a final
rate increase of $19 million annually.

                                            $45.1                  $ (4.5)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Electric Sales. Kilowatt-hour sales reached a new record level in 1995 due to
warm summer  weather and increased  demand from large  industrial  customers and
other power suppliers.  The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand
services and  assistance  provided to its  customers  as well as increase  sales
beyond the Company's traditional service territory.
   The two major industries in Minnesota  Power's service territory are taconite
production,  and paper and wood  products  manufacturing.  These two  industries
contributed  about half of the Company's  electric  operating  revenue from 1993
through 1995.  Taconite mining customers accounted for 35% of electric operating
revenue  in 1995,  and 34% in 1994  and in 1993.  The  paper  and wood  products
industries  accounted for 12% of electric operating revenue in 1995, 13% in 1994
and 14% in 1993.
   Taconite is an important raw material for the steel industry and is made from
low iron content ore mined in northern Minnesota. Taconite processing plants use
large  quantities of electric  power to grind the ore and  concentrate  the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 47
million tons in 1995  compared to 43 million tons in 1994 and 41 million tons in
1993. Minnesota's taconite production in 1996 is expected to be approximately 48
million tons. An 18% increase in kWh sold to taconite  customers  contributed to
higher electric sales in 1995.
   While  taconite  production  is expected  to continue at near record  setting
levels,  the long-term  future of this cyclical  industry is less certain.  Even
with the Company's commitment to help the taconite customers remain competitive,
it is possible that production  will decline  gradually some time after the year
2005.

   Large Power  Customer  Contracts.  Electric  service  contracts with 11 large
power  industrial  customers  require  payment of minimum monthly demand charges
that cover most fixed costs  associated with having capacity  available to serve
them,  including a return on common  equity.  The demand charge is paid by these
customers even if no electrical  energy is taken.  An energy charge is also paid
to cover the variable  cost of energy  actually  used. A four-year  cancellation
notice is required  to  terminate  the  contracts.  The rates and  corresponding
revenue  associated  with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are
subject to change through the regulatory  process  governing all retail electric
rates.

Summary of Revenue and Demand Under Contract as of February 1, 1996

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The  Company   believes  revenue  from  these  large  power  customers  will  be
substantially in excess of the minimum contract amounts.

   These 11 large power  customers  each require 10 MW or more of power and have
contract  termination  dates ranging from April 1997 to December  2005.  Five of
these customers are taconite producers,  five are paper manufacturers and one is
a pipeline company. In addition to the minimum demand provisions,  the contracts
with the taconite  producers  require these  customers to purchase  their entire
electric service requirements from the Company. Six of the large power customers
purchase  a  combined  total  of 200 MW of  interruptible  service  pursuant  to
contract  amendments  incorporating an interruptible  rate schedule.  Under this
schedule  and pursuant to these  amendments,  the Company has the right to serve
100 MW of these customers' needs through Oct. 31, 2008, and an additional 100 MW
of these  customers'  needs through April 30, 2010. The Company has the right of
first  refusal to serve an  additional  200 MW during  these  same time  periods
following  the  termination  of any of  these  contracts.  In  total  these  six
customers will save about $12 million annually in reduced demand charges. These
savings are partially offset by the cost of  interruptible  energy being higher
than the cost of firm  energy.  The  Company is able to market the 200 MW of 
capacity to other power suppliers.
   Fuel. The cost of coal is the Company's  largest single operating  expense in
generating electricity. Coal consumption at the Company's generating stations in
1995 was 3.6  million  tons.  Minnesota  Power  currently  has two  coal  supply
agreements  in place with  Montana  suppliers  which  terminate  in May 1997 and
December 2000. Under these agreements the Company has the tonnage flexibility to
procure  between 55% and 100% of its total coal  requirements.  The Company will
use  this  flexibility  to  purchase  coal  under  spot-market  agreements  when
favorable  market  conditions  exist.  The Company  continues to explore  future
supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous
coal will be  available.  The Company has  contracts  with  Burlington  Northern
Railroad to deliver  coal from Montana and Wyoming to the  Company's  generating
facilities in Minnesota through December 2003.
   Purchased  Power  Contract.  Under an agreement  extending  through 2007 with
Square  Butte,  Minnesota  Power  purchases  71% (about 320 MW during the summer
months  and 333 MW during  the  winter  months)  of the  output of a  mine-mouth
generating unit located near Center,  North Dakota. The Square Butte unit is one
of two  lignite-fired  units at  Minnkota  Power  Cooperative's  Milton R. Young
Generating Station.
   Square Butte has the option,  upon five years advance  notice,  to reduce the
Company's  share of the unit's  output to 49%.  Minnesota  Power has the option,
though  not the  obligation,  to  continue  to  purchase  49% of the  output  at
market-based  prices  after  2007  to  the  end of the  plant's  economic  life.
Minnesota  Power must pay any Square Butte costs and expenses that have not been
paid by Square Butte when due, regardless of whether or not the Company received
any power from that unit.
   Early  Retirement Plan. In 1995 an early retirement offer was accepted by 178
of the 215 eligible electric utility employees,  representing a 12% reduction of
the electric operations  workforce.  A cost of approximately $15 million will be
amortized over 3 years consistent with regulatory precedent. The plan was funded
through excess pension plan assets.  The early  retirement  offer is part of
the Company's ongoing efforts to control costs and maintain low electric rates.
   Competition.  The competitive  landscape of the electric  utility industry is
changing at both the  wholesale and retail levels, and is affecting the way the
Company strategically views the future.
   Wholesale.  In 1995 the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on
Open Access  Non-Discriminatory  Transmission  Services by Public  Utilities and
Transmitting  Utilities and a supplemental  NOPR on Recovery of Stranded  Costs.
The purpose of the proposed rules is to facilitate  wholesale power competition,
remove undue  discrimination  in electric  transmission  and set  standards  for
recovery of stranded costs through  FERC-approved  rates for wholesale  service.
These final FERC rules are expected to be published by mid-1996.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
   Regional.  The  Company  is a member of the  Mid-Continent  Area  Power  Pool
(MAPP). The MAPP power pool enhances electric service reliability,  and provides
the opportunity for members to enter into various  wholesale power  transactions
and coordinate planning of new generation and transmission facilities.  The MAPP
membership  is in the  process  of  reorganizing  to  establish  (1) a  regional
transmission group to provide comparable and efficient transmission service on a
regional  basis,  coordinate  regional  transmission  planning  and  to  resolve
transmission  service  disputes;  (2) a power and energy market for market-based
wholesale  transactions  among  interested  participants;  and (3) a  generation
reserve sharing pool to maintain and share  generation  reserves for purposes of
further  efficiencies.  The reorganization  must be approved by MAPP and will be
subject to FERC approval.
   Retail.  In 1995 the MPUC  initiated an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  in the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery  of  electric   service   continues  to  be  efficient   following  any
restructuring,  the MPUC adopted 15 principles to guide a deliberate and orderly
approach to developing  reasonable  restructuring  alternatives  that ensure the
fairness of a  competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January
1996  the  MPUC  established  a  competition  working  group  in  which  company
representatives   will  participate  to  initially  address  issues  related  to
wholesale  competition and then to consider retail  competition issues including
rate flexibility, innovative regulation, unbundling, safety and reliability.
   Customers.  Minnesota Power  anticipates  that its large power customers will
continue to aggressively  seek lower energy costs through  negotiations with the
Company and  consideration of alternative  suppliers.  With electric rates among
the lowest in the United States and with its long-term wholesale and large power
contracts in place,  Minnesota  Power believes it is well  positioned to address
competitive pressures. The Company remains opposed to retail wheeling because it
would benefit only a few large customers while potentially  adversely  impacting
smaller customers' rates and shareholder returns.
   Conservation.  Minnesota  requires electric utilities to spend 1.5% of annual
electric revenue on conservation improvement programs (CIP) each year. State law
allows utilities to recover  state-approved CIP costs through a customer billing
mechanism.  Since  January  1994 the  Company  has been  recovering  ongoing CIP
spending and $8.2 million of CIP spending from previous years. A billing 
adjustment and retail  base rates  allow the  Company to  recover both costs of
energy-saving programs and "lost margins" associated with power saved as a
result of such programs.
   The  Company's  largest  conservation  programs  are targeted at taconite and
paper  customers to promote  their  efficient  use of energy.  CIP also provides
demand-side  management  grants on a competitive  basis to commercial  and small
industrial  customers,  low-cost  financing for energy-saving  investments,  and
promotes energy conservation for all residential and commercial customers. SWL&P
also offers  electric and gas  conservation  programs to qualified  customers as
approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.
   Clean Air Act. While many utilities and their  customers will face high costs
to comply  with  clean-air  legislation,  the  Company  expects  to meet  future
requirements  without  major  spending.  By  burning  low-sulfur  fuels in units
equipped with pollution  control  equipment,  the Company's power plants already
operate at or near the sulfur dioxide  emission  limits set for the year 2000 by
the Federal  Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990.  To meet newly  proposed  nitrogen
oxide  emission  limits for 2000,  the  Company  expects  to install  new burner
technology that is currently  estimated to cost $9 to $11 million in total,  for
Boswell and Laskin.  No limits have been proposed for Hibbard.  Total  clean-air
compliance  costs cannot be accurately  estimated  yet, as  regulations  are not
final.
   1995 to 1994 Comparison.  1995 was an excellent year for electric operations.
The  Company  set new  records  for  electric  sales,  revenue  and  generation.
Operating revenue from electric  operations was higher in 1995 compared to 1994,
due to a 13% increase in total kWh sales, increased retail rates in effect since
June 1, 1995,  and  collection  of CIP  expenditures.  Warm  summer  weather and
increased  demand from large  industrial  customers  and other  power  suppliers
significantly  increased sales over 1994. Electric operations earned a return of
13.3% on average  common  equity  invested  in electric  utility  plant in 1995,
compared with 12.8% in 1994.
   1994 to 1993 Comparison.  Total electric sales increased 4% primarily because
of increased sales to large industrial customers,  wholesale customers and other
power suppliers.  Operating  revenue included $11.1 million from interim rates
collected after  March 1,  1994,  and $7.8 million  from the  recovery  of CIP 
expenses  in 1994. Operating  revenue was $12.4  million  lower in 1994  because
of reduced  demand revenue from National and lower rates associated with 
interruptible service. The Company also  completed  recovery of the remaining 
$3.9 million of coal contract buyout costs in March 1994, whereas 1993 included
$18.5 million, a full year recovery. Additionally  the  unbilled  revenue  
adjustment  added $5.1 million to revenue in 1993. Electric  operations  earned 
a return of 12.8% on average common equity invested in electric utility plant
in 1994, compared with 12.4% in 1993.

Water Operations
   Water  operations  include  SSU and  Heater.  SSU  provides  water to 117,000
customers  and  wastewater  treatment  services to 53,000  customers in Florida.
Heater provides water to 26,000 customers and wastewater  treatment  services to
3,000 customers in North Carolina and South Carolina.
   Water and Wastewater Rates. In April 1995 the Florida First District Court of
Appeals  reversed the 1993 FPSC order which approved uniform rates for most of
SSU's  service areas in Florida.  Consequently,  the FPSC ordered the Company to
refund about $10 million,  including interest,  to customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  The FPSC also indicated  that it would not permit  collection of the $10
million from customers who paid less under uniform rates.  With "uniform rates,"
all  customers  in the  uniform  rate  areas  pay the same  rates  for water and
wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative to  "stand-alone"  rates
which are calculated based on the cost of serving each service area. In November
1995 SSU filed a request for FPSC reconsideration.  The Company believes that it
would be  improper  for the FPSC to order a  refund  to one  group of  customers
without  permitting  recovery of a similar  amount from the remaining  customers
because the First  District Court of Appeals only addressed the issue of alleged
over-payment  by some  service  areas under the uniform  rate design and not the
Company's total revenue  requirement for operations in Florida. If the FPSC does
not adopt SSU's position on reconsideration, SSU will vigorously pursue reversal
of the FPSC's decision in the courts. No provision for refund has been recorded.
   In June 1995 SSU filed a request  with the FPSC for an $18.6  million  annual
increase in water and  wastewater  treatment  rates.  On Nov. 1, 1995,  the FPSC
denied the Company's  original $12 million interim rate request for two reasons:
(1) it was based on uniform  rates which were  deemed  improper by a court order
subsequent  to the  Company's  original  filing,  and (2) the  FPSC  had not yet
formulated  a policy on allowable  investments  and expenses to be included in a
forward-looking  interim test year. The Company submitted additional information
to support interim rate approval of $12 million based on a forward-looking  test
year and $8.4 million based on a historical test year. On Jan. 4, 1996, the FPSC
permitted  the  Company  to  implement  an  interim  rate  increase  (based on a
historical  test year) of $7.9  million,  on an annualized  basis,  over revenue
previously  collected  under a uniform rate  structure.  Interim rates went into
effect on Jan. 23, 1996.  Final rates are anticipated to become effective in the
fourth quarter of 1996.
   Florida law permits  water and  wastewater  utilities to make an annual index
filing to recover  inflationary  increases in system  operations and maintenance
expenses,  thus  delaying  or  avoiding  the costs of full  rate  case  filings.
Similarly,  another  Florida law allows water and  wastewater  utilities to file
annually to recover increased purchased water and wastewater treatment costs and
property tax  increases.  Since 1993 the Company was allowed $2.9 million of the
$3 million requested in annual rate increases under these laws.

   Competition.  The responsibility of providing the fast growing populations of
Florida,  North  Carolina and South  Carolina  with an adequate  supply of clean
water  requires the constant  attention  and  foresight of the  Company's  water
operations.
   The regulated water and wastewater services industry is experiencing a series
of transformations  including privatization,  consolidation and regionalization.
These new trends are a direct result of expanded  environmental  regulation  and
increasingly limited water supply and wastewater disposal options. Consequently,
growth in the  industry  will be  realized  by those who make  adequate  capital
investment to achieve these  transformations.  Since economic regulation has not
kept pace with the investment  demands placed on private  utilities,  regulatory
lag has delayed the recovery of private utilities' service costs.
   Historically,  competition  and  change  have been  minimal in the water and
wastewater industry.  During the next five years,  however, the Company believes
that the  water  and  wastewater  industry  will  become  more  competitive  and
innovation-driven.  The Company is focused on the  application  of technology to
reduce  costs and  increase  efficiency,  objectives  that are  critical  in the
competitive pursuit of regulated, as well as unregulated, markets.
   1995 and 1994 Comparison.  Operating revenue and income from water operations
fell 24% in 1995  compared to 1994.  The decrease is  attributed to 15,000 fewer
customers  following  the sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets in December  1994 and
lower  water   consumption   due  to  abnormally   high  rainfall  and  customer
conservation  efforts.  The sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets  contributed  $19.1
million to water operations in 1994.  Customers lost in the Venice Gardens' sale
were replaced in December  1995 when the Company  purchased the assets of Orange
Osceola Utilities, Inc. for $13 million. This purchase added 17,000 customers to
the Company's Florida customer base.
   1994 and 1993 Comparison.  Operating revenue and income from water operations
increased 39% in 1994 compared to 1993 due to the $19.1 million gain  associated
with the December  1994 sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets.  1994 also included 12
months of increased rates, while 1993 included only four months. Abnormally high
rainfall in Florida and customer water conservation efforts offset the new rates
in 1994.

Automobile Auctions
   Minnesota Power has an 83% ownership interest in ADESA,  the third largest  
automobile auction  business in the United States.  ADESA,  headquartered  in 
Indianapolis, Indiana,  owns and  operates 19  automobile  auctions  in the 
United  States and Canada, through  which  used  cars and  other  vehicles  are 
sold to  franchised automobile dealers and licensed used car dealers.  Two 
wholly owned subsidiaries of ADESA, Automotive Finance Corporation (AFC) and 
ADESA Auto Transport, perform related services.  Sellers at ADESA's auctions 
include domestic and foreign auto manufacturers, car dealers, fleet/lease 
companies, banks and finance companies.
   The Company  acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995, for $167 million in cash.
Proceeds  from the sale of the paper and pulp  business  combined  with proceeds
from the sale of  securities  investments  were used to fund  this  acquisition.
Acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets associated with this acquisition
are being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over  periods not  exceeding  40
years. In January 1996 the Company provided an additional $15 million of capital
in exchange for  1,982,346  original  issue  common stock shares of ADESA.  This
capital contribution increased the Company's ownership interest in ADESA to 83%.
Put and call agreements with ADESA's four top managers  provide ADESA management
the right to sell to Minnesota Power, and Minnesota Power the right to purchase,
ADESA  management's  17% retained  ownership  interest in ADESA,  in  increments
during the years  1997,  1998 and 1999,  at a price  based on ADESA's  financial
performance.
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, 1995,  operating  revenue was $61.3 million
with no net income  contribution.  Financial  results are  attributed to auction
cancellations  because of severe weather conditions in the eastern United States
in December 1995, as well as start-up costs  associated with major  construction
projects.  First quarter 1996 financial  results will also be affected by severe
weather which continued in January 1996.
   Competition.  Within the automobile  auction  industry,  ADESA's  competition
includes  independently  owned auctions as well as major chains and associations
with auctions in  geographic  proximity to those of ADESA.  ADESA  competes with
other auctions for dealers,  financial institutions and other sellers to provide
automobiles  for  auction  at  consignment  sales  and for the  supply of rental
repurchase  vehicles from the  automobile  manufacturers  for auction at factory
sales.  The  automobile  manufacturers  often  choose  between  auctions  across
multi-state areas in distributing rental repurchase vehicles. ADESA competes for
sellers of  automobiles  by  attempting  to attract a large number of dealers to
purchase vehicles,  which ensures  competitive prices and supports the volume of
vehicles  auctioned,  and  by  providing  a full  range  of  services  including
floorplan  financing,  reconditioning  services  which prepare  automobiles  for
auction,  transporting  automobiles  to auction  and the prompt  handling of the
paperwork necessary to complete the sales.
   Auto auction  sales for the industry are predicted to rise at a rate of 6% to
8% annually.  ADESA expects to  participate  in this  industry's  growth through
acquisitions,  greenfield  start-ups and expanded  services.  In September  1995
ADESA  opened  the  world's  largest  indoor  automobile   auction  facility  in
Framingham,  Massachusetts.  Expansion  projects  at  Manville,  New  Jersey and
Jacksonville,  Florida and a  relocation  project in  Indianapolis,  Indiana are
nearing completion. These projects are expected to begin operations in the first
quarter of 1996.

Investments
   Investments include an 80% interest in Lehigh, a Florida real estate company,
a 22.1%  equity  investment  in Capital  Re, a  financial  guaranty  reinsurance
company,  and a portfolio  of  securities  managed by  Minnesota  Power which is
intended  to provide  funds for  reinvestment  and  business  acquisitions.  The
Company  ceased  operations at Reach All, the  truck-mounted  lifting  equipment
business, and sold its assets in 1995.
   Portfolio. The performance of the securities portfolio improved significantly
over 1994 earning an after-tax  return of 8.7% in 1995  compared to 1.7% in 1994
and 7.4% in 1993.  Securities  investments  totaling  $60  million  were sold to
partially fund the purchase of ADESA.  Poor market  conditions and the write-off
of a $10.1 securities  investment lowered earnings in 1994 compared to 1993. The
Company  plans to continue to  concentrate  in market  neutral  strategies  that
provide stable and acceptable  returns  without  sacrificing  needed  liquidity.
Returns will continue to be partially dependent upon general market yields.
   Reinsurance.  The Company's equity investment in Capital Re continues to be a
major  contributor to earnings.  In 1995 Capital Re contributed  $8.2 million to
earnings  compared  to $7 million in 1994 and $5.7  million in 1993.  Capital Re
earned  after-tax  returns  of 10.1% in 1995,  10.5% in 1994 and  10.1% in 1993.
Capital Re is the parent company of a group of specialty reinsurance companies.
   Real Estate Operations. Income from real estate operations was higher in 1995
than 1994 primarily due to the recognition of $18.4 million of tax benefits.  In
March  1995,  based on the  results of a project  which  analyzed  the  economic
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board
of directors of Lehigh  directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's
assets  in a  manner  that  would  maximize  utilization  of tax  benefits.  The
Company's portion of the tax benefits  reflected in net income is $14.7 million.
This tax  benefit  was  partially  offset  by fewer  commercial  land  sales and
Lehigh's maturing accounts  receivable  portfolio.  Earnings were higher in 1994
compared to 1993  because  the  recognition  of escrow  funds  contributed  $3.6
million in 1994.
   Lehigh currently owns 4,000 acres of land and  approximately  8,000 homesites
near Fort Myers,  Florida and 1,250  homesites in Citrus  County,  Florida. The
real estate strategy is to acquire large residential community properties at low
cost, adding value, and selling them at going market prices.
   Other.  Included  are the  financial  results  for Reach All and  charges for
general  corporate  expenses.  In 1995 Reach  All's  operating  assets were sold
resulting  in a 14 cent per share loss  compared to an 11 cent per share loss in
1994.  Pre-tax losses from Reach All were $6.4 million in 1995,  $5.2 million in
1994 and $764,000 in 1993.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
   As  detailed in the  consolidated  statement  of cash flows,  cash flows from
operating  activities  were  affected by a number of factors  representative  of
normal operations.  Automobile auction operations are included since the July 1,
1995, acquisition of ADESA.
   Cash from investing  activities  included proceeds from the sale of the paper
and pulp  business  and  proceeds  from the sale of a portion of the  securities
portfolio that was used to fund the purchase of ADESA.
   Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally is provided by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and approximately 700,000 original issue shares of common stock are
available  for  issuance  through the DRIP.  Minnesota  Power's $77 million bank
lines of credit provide  liquidity for the Company's  commercial  paper program.
The amount and timing of future sales of the  Company's  securities  will depend
upon market  conditions and the specific  needs of the Company.  The Company may
from time to time sell securities to meet capital  requirements,  to provide for
the early  redemption of issues of long-term  debt and/or  preferred  stock,  to
reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.
   A substantial amount of ADESA's working capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA utilizes an $18 million line
of credit to meet  short-term  working  capital  requirements  arising  from the
timing of payment  obligations to vehicle sellers and the  availability of funds
from vehicle purchasers. During the sales process, ADESA does not typically take
title to vehicles.
   AFC  also  offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for  dealers  to  purchase
automobiles   at  auctions  in  exchange  for  a  security   interest  in  those
automobiles.  The  financing  is  provided  through  the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the  automobile  or a general  borrowing  term of 30-60 days.  As a
result,  AFC has a $40 million  revolving line of credit to meet its operational
requirements.
   In January  1996  SSU issued $35.1  million of 6.5%  Industrial  Development
Refunding  Revenue Bonds Series 1996 due Oct. 1, 2025. The proceeds were used to
refund  existing  industrial  development  revenue bonds totaling $33.8 million.
Also in January  1996  the Company  contributed  an  additional  $15 million of
equity to ADESA in exchange for 1,982,346  shares of ADESA original issue common
stock. As a result, the Company's  ownership interest increased from 80% to 83%.
Funds from the issuance of commercial paper were used to purchase the additional
shares. ADESA expects to use the funds to pay for capital expansion projects.
   Minnesota Power's electric utility first mortgage bonds and secured pollution
control bonds are currently rated the following investment grades: A3 by Moody's
Investor  Services,  A- by  Standard  and Poor's,  and A- by Duff & Phelps.  The
disclosure of these  security  ratings is not a  recommendation  to buy, sell or
hold the Company's securities.
   In 1995 the Company paid out 94% of its per-share earnings in dividends. Over
the longer term,  Minnesota  Power's goal is to reduce dividend payout to 75% to
80% of earnings.  This is expected to be  accomplished  by  increasing  earnings
rather than reducing dividends.
   Capital Requirements.  Consolidated capital expenditures in 1995 totaled $115
million.  These expenditures  included $38 million for electric  operations,  of
which $7 million was for coal  operations,  $34 million for water operations and
$43 million for automobile  auction site relocation and development.  Internally
generated  funds and  long-term  bank  financing  was used to fund these capital
expenditures.
   Capital  expenditures  are expected to be $93 million in 1996 and total about
$325 for 1997 through 2000.  The 1996 amount  includes $34 for routine  electric
capital  expenditures,  $25 million for upgrades,  water reuse  projects and new
water  facilities,  $28 for automobile  auction site relocation and development,
and $6 million for coal mining  equipment  and other capital  expenditures.  The
Company expects to use internally generated funds,  long-term bank financing and
original issue equity securities to fund these capital expenditures.
   No new power plants or major  changes to existing  plants are expected in the
1996-2010  period.  Future water utility capital  expenditures  include facility
upgrades to meet environmental  standards and new water and wastewater treatment
facilities to accommodate  customer growth.  Capital expenditures for automobile
auctions will continue to be for auction site relocation and development.
   New Accounting Standards. In March 1995 the FASB issued SFAS 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of," effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 1995. SFAS 121 requires
that long-lived assets and intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable. SFAS 121 also requires that a utility's deferred regulatory charges
must be  probable  of  recovery  in future  rates.  The  adoption of SFAS 121 is
expected to be  immaterial to the  Company's  financial  position and results of
operations.
   In  October  1995 the FASB  issued  SFAS  123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation,"  effective for fiscal years  beginning  after Dec. 15, 1995. SFAS
123 requires companies to either record or disclose pro forma information on the
fair value of certain stock-based employee  compensation  programs.  In 1996 the
Company  anticipates  offering  stock  options  to  certain  employees  and,  in
accordance with SFAS 123, will be required either to record compensation expense
for stock options based on their fair values or provide pro forma disclosures of
net income and earnings per share reflecting this information. The Company plans
to account for its stock-based employee compensation programs in accordance with
APB 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees," and will provide the pro
forma disclosures required by SFAS 123, if material.

   In our opinion,  based upon our audits and the report of other auditors,  the
accompanying  consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements
of income,  of  retained  earnings  and of cash  flows  present  fairly,  in all
material   respects,   the  financial   position  of  Minnesota  Power  and  its
subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended  December
31, 1995, in conformity with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management;  our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial  statements of ADESA Corporation,  an
80% owned  subsidiary  acquired  July 1, 1995,  which  statements  reflect total
assets of  $355,819,000  at December 31, 1995 and total  revenues of $60,641,000
for the six month period ended December 31, 1995.  Those statements were audited
by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion
expressed  herein,  insofar  as it  relates to the  amounts  included  for ADESA
Corporation,  is based solely on the report of the other auditors.  We conducted
our audits of these  statements in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits  and the  report of other  auditors  provide a  reasonable  basis for the
opinion expressed above.

Management

   The consolidated  financial  statements and other financial  information were
prepared  by  management,   which  is  responsible   for  their   integrity  and
objectivity.  The financial  statements  have been  prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles as applied to regulated utilities and
necessarily  include some amounts that are based on informed  judgments and best
estimates of management.
   To  meet  its  responsibilities   with  respect  to  financial   information,
management  maintains  and  enforces a system of  internal  accounting  controls
designed to provide assurance,  on a cost effective basis, that transactions are
carried out in accordance with management's  authorizations  and that assets are
safeguarded  against  loss from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The  system
includes an organizational  structure which provides an appropriate  segregation
of  responsibilities,  careful  selection  and  training of  personnel,  written
policies and procedures,  and periodic reviews by the internal audit department.
In addition,  the Company has a personnel policy which requires all employees to
maintain a high standard of ethical conduct.  Management  believes the system is
effective and provides  reasonable  assurance that all transactions are properly
recorded and have been executed in accordance with  management's  authorization.
Management  modifies and improves its system of internal  accounting controls in
response to changes in business  conditions.  The Company's internal audit staff
is charged  with the  responsibility  for  determining  compliance  with Company
procedures.
   Five directors of the Company, not members of management,  serve as the Audit
Committee.  The  Board of  Directors,  through  its  Audit  Committee,  oversees
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets
regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants
to discuss  auditing and  financial  matters and to assure that each is carrying
out its responsibilities.  The internal auditors and the independent accountants
have full and free access to the Audit Committee without management present.
   Price  Waterhouse  LLP and Ernst & Young LLP,  independent  accountants,  are
engaged to express an opinion  on the  financial  statements.  Their  audits are
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and include a
review of internal  controls and test  transactions  to the extent  necessary to
allow them to report on the  fairness of the  operating  results  and  financial
condition of the Company.

                         Report of Independent Auditors


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
ADESA Corporation


We have audited the  consolidated  balance  sheet of ADESA  Corporation,  an 80%
owned  subsidiary of Minnesota  Power & Light Company (MPL),  as of December 31,
1995, and the related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity,
and cash flows for the period from July 1, 1995, (date of acquisition by MPL) to
December 31, 1995, (not presented separately herein). These financial statements
are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the consolidated financial position of ADESA Corporation
at December 31, 1995,  and the  consolidated  results of its  operations and its
cash flows for the period from July 1, 1995, to December 31, 1995, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                             Ernst & Young LLP

2 Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
   Financial  Statement  Preparation.  Minnesota  Power  prepares its  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
principles  require management to make estimates and assumptions that (1) affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  (2) disclose  contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,  and (3) report amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
   Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial  statements include
the accounts of the Company and all of its majority owned subsidiary  companies.
All material  intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.
   Nature  of  Operations  and  Revenue   Recognition.   Minnesota  Power  is  a
diversified utility that has operations in four principal business segments.
   Electric  Operations.  Electric  service is provided to 136,000  customers in
northern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. Large industrial customers, which
include  paper mills,  Minnesota's  taconite  industry  and a pipeline  company,
purchase under contract about half of the electricity the Company generates. BNI
Coal, a subsidiary,  mines and sells lignite coal to two North Dakota mine-mouth
generating  units,  one of which is Square Butte which supplies  Minnesota Power
with 71% of its output under a long-term contract. (See Note 12.)
   Electric  rates are under  the  jurisdiction  of  various  state and  federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued  for  service  provided  but  not yet  billed.  Electric  rates  include
adjustment  clauses which bill or credit customers for fuel and purchased energy
costs above or below the base levels in rate schedules and bill retail customers
for the recovery of CIP expenditures not collected in base rates.
   During  1995,  1994 and 1993,  revenue  derived  from one major  customer was
$60.4, $60.2 and $59.6 million, respectively. Revenue derived from another major
customer was $44.9, $45.3 and $45 million, respectively.
   Water Operations.  SSU, a wholly owned subsidiary, is the largest independent
supplier of water and wastewater  utility  service in Florida.  Heater,  another
subsidiary,  provides water and wastewater  services in North Carolina and South
Carolina.  In total, 143,000 water and 56,000 wastewater treatment customers are
served.  Water  rates are under the  jurisdiction  of  various  state and county
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued for water sold but not billed.
   Automobile  Auctions.  In July 1995, the Company  purchased 80% of ADESA,  an
automobile  auction  business  that  operates in 19  locations  in the U.S.  and
Canada. As discussed in Note 3, the Company's  ownership  interest  increased to
83% in January 1996. ADESA acts as an agent in the sales process, receiving fees
from both buyers and sellers of automobiles. ADESA also provides a wide range of
related  services  such  as  floorplan  financing,  auto  reconditioning,  title
processing  and vehicle  transport.  Revenue is  recognized  when  services  are
performed.
   Investments.   The  Company's   securities   portfolio   provides  funds  for
reinvestment  and business  acquisitions.  The Company has a 22.1%  ownership in
Capital Re, a financial guaranty  reinsurance  company,  accounted for using the
equity method,  and an 80% ownership in Lehigh,  a Florida real estate business.
Real estate revenue is recognized on the accrual basis. Investment income is 
discussed in Note 7.
   Plant and  Depreciation.  Plant is  recorded at  original  cost.  The cost of
additions  to  plant  and  replacement  of  retirement  units  of  property  are
capitalized.  Maintenance  costs and replacements of minor items of property are
charged to expense as incurred.  Costs of depreciable units of plant retired are
eliminated  from the plant  accounts.  Such costs  plus  removal  expenses  less
salvage are charged to  accumulated  depreciation.  Plant  stated on the balance
sheet  includes  construction  work  in  progress  and  is  net  of  accumulated
depreciation.   Various   pollution   abatement   facilities   are  leased  from
municipalities  which have issued pollution control revenue bonds to finance the
cost  of the  facilities.  The  cost of the  facilities  and  the  related  debt
obligation,  which is guaranteed  by the Company,  has been recorded as electric
plant and long-term debt, respectively.
   Depreciation  of utility  plant is computed  using  rates based on  estimated
useful lives of the various classes of property.  Provisions for depreciation of
the average original cost of depreciable property  approximated 3.3% in 1995, 3%
in 1994 and 2.9% in 1993.  Contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) relate to
water  and  wastewater  plant  contributed  to the  Company  by  developers  and
customers. CIAC is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of
the asset to which it  relates  when  placed in  service.  Amortization  of CIAC
reduces depreciation expense.
   Fuel,  Material and Supplies.  Fuel, material and supplies are stated at the 
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.
   Goodwill.  Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  cost  over  net  assets  of
businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years.
   Deferred  Regulatory  Charges  and  Credits.  The  Company  is subject to the
provisions  of SFAS  71,  "Accounting  for  the  Effects  of  Certain  Types  of
Regulation."  The Company  capitalizes as deferred  regulatory  charges incurred
costs  which  are  probable  of  recovery  in  future  utility  rates.  Deferred
regulatory  credits  represent  amounts  expected to be credited to customers in
rates. (See Note 4.)
   Unamortized  Expense,  Discount  and Premium on Debt.  Expense,  discount and
premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.
   Cash and Cash Equivalents.  The Company  considers all investments  purchased
with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

3 Acquisitions and Divestitures
   Acquisition of ADESA.  The Company acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995, for
$167 million in cash. The Company  accounted for the  acquisition as a purchase.
Acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets associated with this acquisition
are being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over  periods not  exceeding  40
years. In January 1996 the Company provided an additional $15 million of capital
in exchange for  1,982,346  original  issue  common stock shares of ADESA.  This
capital contribution increased the Company's ownership interest in ADESA to 83%.
Put and call agreements with ADESA's four top managers  provide ADESA management
the right to sell to Minnesota Power, and Minnesota Power the right to purchase,
ADESA  management's  17% retained  ownership  interest in ADESA,  in  increments
during the years  1997,  1998 and 1999,  at a price  based on ADESA's  financial
performance.
   The following summary presents unaudited pro forma consolidated results as if
ADESA was acquired on Jan. 1, 1994.  The pro forma  results are not  necessarily
indicative of what  actually  would have  occurred if the  acquisition  had been
completed as of the beginning of 1994,  nor are they  necessarily  indicative of
future consolidated results. The pro forma results should be read in conjunction
with the  historical  consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes of
Minnesota Power.

   Acquisition  of Orange  Osceola.  On Dec. 1, 1995, SSU acquired the operating
assets  of  Orange  Osceola  Utilities  for   approximately  $13  million.   The
acquisition adds over 17,000 water customers.
   Sale of Water Plant  Assets.  In December  1994 SSU sold all of the assets of
its Venice Gardens water and wastewater utilities to Sarasota County in Florida
(the  County) for $37.6  million.  The sale  increased  1994 net income by $11.8
million and contributed 42 cents to 1994 earnings per share. Water operations on
the  consolidated  statement of income  includes a pre-tax gain of $19.1 million
from the sale.  This sale was  negotiated in  anticipation  of an eminent domain
action by the County.
   Discontinued Operations.  On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its interest
in the paper and pulp  business  to  Consolidated  Papers,  Inc.  (CPI) for $118
million in cash,  plus CPI's  assumption of certain debt and lease  obligations.
The Company is still committed to a maximum  guaranty of $90 million to ensure a
portion of a $33.4  million  annual lease  obligation  for paper mill  equipment
under an  operating  lease  extending to 2012.  CPI has agreed to indemnify  the
Company  for any  payments  the  Company  may make as a result of the  Company's
obligation relating to this operating lease.
   The financial  results of the paper and pulp business,  including the loss on
disposition, have been accounted for as discontinued operations.

4 Regulatory Matters
   The Company  files for periodic  rate  revisions  with the  Minnesota  Public
Utilities  Commission (MPUC),  the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC),
the  Florida  Public  Service  Commission  (FPSC)  and other  state  and  county
regulatory authorities. The MPUC had regulatory authority over approximately 76%
in 1995, 77% in 1994 and 76% in 1993 of the Company's  total electric  operating
revenue.  Interim rates in Minnesota and Florida are placed into effect, subject
to refund with interest, pending a final decision by the appropriate commission.
   Electric Rate Proceedings.  In November 1994, the MPUC granted the Company an
increase in annual electric operating revenue of $19 million and an 11.6% return
on  equity.  Effective  June 1,  1995,  rates  for  large  industrial  customers
increased less than 4%, while the rate for smaller  businesses  increased  6.5%.
Rate  increases  for  residential  customers  were approved to be phased in over
three years:  13.5% began in June 1995 and 3.75% in January 1996,  another 3.75%
will begin in January 1997.
   In January 1994 the Company began  recovering  ongoing CIP  expenditures  and
$8.2  million of deferred  CIP  expenditures  incurred  prior to Dec.  31, 1993,
through a customer  billing  adjustment  and retail  base rates  approved by the
MPUC.  The  Company  collected  $10.8  million  and $7.8  million of CIP related
revenue in 1995 and 1994.
   Water Rate  Proceedings.  In April 1995 the Florida First  District  Court of
Appeals  reversed the 1993 FPSC order which approved uniform rates for most of
SSU's  service areas in Florida.  Consequently,  the FPSC ordered the Company to
refund about $10 million,  including interest,  to customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  The FPSC also indicated  that it would not permit  collection of the $10
million from customers who paid less under uniform rates.  With "uniform rates,"
all  customers  in the  uniform  rate  areas  pay the same  rates  for water and
wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative to  "stand-alone"  rates
which are calculated based on the cost of serving each service area. In November
1995 SSU filed a request for FPSC reconsideration.  The Company believes that it
would be  improper  for the FPSC to order a  refund  to one  group of  customers
without  permitting  recovery of a similar  amount from the remaining  customers
because the First  District Court of Appeals only addressed the issue of alleged
over-payment  by some  service  areas under the uniform  rate design and not the
Company's total revenue  requirement for operations in Florida. If the FPSC does
not adopt SSU's position on reconsideration, SSU will vigorously pursue reversal
of the FPSC's decision in the courts. No provision for refund has been recorded.
   In June 1995 SSU filed a request  with the FPSC for an $18.6  million  annual
increase in water and  wastewater  treatment  rates.  On Nov. 1, 1995,  the FPSC
denied the Company's  original $12 million interim rate request for two reasons:
(1) it was based on uniform  rates which were  deemed  improper by a court order
subsequent  to the  Company's  original  filing,  and (2) the  FPSC  had not yet
formulated  a policy on allowable  investments  and expenses to be included in a
forward-looking  interim test year. The Company submitted additional information
to support interim rate approval of $12 million based on a forward-looking  test
year and $8.4 million based on a historical test year. On Jan. 4, 1996, the FPSC
permitted  the  Company  to  implement  an  interim  rate  increase  (based on a
historical  test year) of $7.9  million,  on an annualized  basis,  over revenue
previously  collected  under a uniform rate  structure.  Interim rates went into
effect on Jan. 23, 1996.  Final rates are anticipated to become effective in the
fourth quarter of 1996.
   Florida law permits  water and  wastewater  utilities to make an annual index
filing to recover  inflationary  increases in system  operations and maintenance
expenses,  thus  delaying  or  avoiding  the costs of full  rate  case  filings.
Similarly,  another  Florida law allows water and  wastewater  utilities to file
annually to recover increased purchased water and wastewater treatment costs and
property tax  increases.  Since 1993 the Company was allowed $2.9 million of the
$3 million requested in annual rate increases under these laws.
   Peabody  Contract  Buyout.  In 1991 Minnesota  Power and Peabody Coal Company
agreed to terminate the 1968 Coal Supply Contract  between the parties (the Coal
Contract) two years ahead of the scheduled  termination date. As approved by the
MPUC and FERC, the Company used the retail and resale fuel adjustment clauses to
pass through to electric  customers the $35 million charge (plus a return on the
funds  used  to make  the  payment)  paid by the  Company  in  December  1991 to
terminate the Coal Contract. The consolidated income statement includes $3.9 and
$18.5  million in 1994 and 1993 of the Coal Contract  termination  costs as fuel
expense and the recovery of these costs in revenue  through the fuel  adjustment
clauses.
   Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. Based on current rate treatment, the
Company believes all deferred regulatory charges are probable of recovery.

5 Jointly Owned Electric Facility
   The Company owns 80% of Boswell Unit 4. While the Company operates the plant,
certain  decisions  with respect to the operations of Boswell Unit 4 are subject
to the oversight of a committee on which the Company and Wisconsin Public Power,
Inc.  SYSTEM  (WPPI),  the owner of the other 20% of Boswell  Unit 4, have equal
representation and voting rights.  Each owner must provide its own financing and
is obligated to pay its ownership share of operating  costs. The Company's share
of direct operating  expenses of Boswell Unit 4 is included in operating expense
on the consolidated statement of income. The Company's 80% share of the original
cost  included in electric  plant at Dec.  31, 1995 and 1994,  was $303 and $306
million.
The  corresponding  provisions for accumulated  depreciation  were $123 and $119
million.

6 Investment in Capital Re
   The Company  has an equity  investment  in Capital  Re, a company  engaged in
financial  guaranty  reinsurance.  During 1995 and 1994 the Company purchased an
additional  517,100  shares of Capital Re common stock for $11 million.  At Dec.
31, 1995, the Company's equity investment was 22.1%. The Company uses the equity
method to account for this investment.

7 Financial Instruments
   Securities Investments.  The majority of the Company's securities investments
are investment-grade stocks of other utility companies and are considered by the
Company to be conservative investments.
   Investments in equity and debt securities are classified in two categories on
the balance sheet:  Trading securities are those bought and held principally for
near-term sale. They are recorded at fair value as part of current assets,  with
changes in fair value during the period included in earnings. Available-for-sale
securities,  which are held for an  indefinite  period of time,  are recorded at
fair value in investments.  Changes in fair value during the period are recorded
net of tax as a separate  component of common stock equity. If the fair value of
any  available-for-sale  securities  declines  below  cost  and the  decline  is
considered  other than temporary,  the securities are written down to fair value
and the losses  charged to earnings.  Realized  gains and losses are computed on
each specific investment sold.

</TABLE>

   Off-Balance-Sheet  Risks. In portfolio  strategies  designed to reduce market
risks,  the Company  sells common stock  securities  short and enters into short
sales of treasury futures contracts.
   Selling  common  stock  securities  short is intended to reduce  market price
risks associated with holding common stock  securities in the Company's  trading
securities  portfolio.  Transactions  involving  short sales of common stock are
completed on average within 90 days from when the transactions are entered into.
Realized  and  unrealized  gains and  losses  from short  sales of common  stock
securities are included in investment income.
   Treasury  futures  are used as a cross  hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks
associated  with  holding  fixed  dividend  preferred  stocks  included  in  the
Company's  available-for-sale  portfolio.  Changes in market  values of treasury
futures are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the underlying
hedged item. Gains and losses on treasury futures are deferred and recognized in
investment income concurrently with gains and losses arising from the underlying
hedged item. Generally,  treasury futures contracts entered into have a maturity
date of 90 days.
   The notional amounts  summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged and
are not a measure of the Company's financial exposure. The amounts exchanged are
calculated on the basis of these  notional  amounts and other terms which relate
to the change in interest rates and securities prices.  The Company  continually
evaluates  the credit  standing of  counterparties  and market  conditions  with
respect to its  off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments.  The Company does not
expect any  counterparties  to fail to meet their  obligations  or any  material
adverse impact to its financial position from these financial instruments.

   Fair Value of Financial  Instruments.  The  carrying  amount of cash and cash
equivalents,  trading securities, notes and other accounts receivable, and notes
payable  approximates  fair  value  because  of  the  short  maturity  of  those
instruments.  The Company records its trading and available-for-sale  securities
at fair  value  based on quoted  market  prices.  The fair  values for all other
financial instruments were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar

</TABLE>

   Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial  instruments that subject the Company
to   concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  trade  and  other
receivables.  The Company  sells  electricity  to about 17 customers in northern
Minnesota's  taconite  and  paper  industries.   At  Dec.  31,  1995  and  1994,
receivables from these customers totaled $7.6 and $8.5 million. The Company does
not obtain  collateral to support utility  receivables,  but monitors the credit
standing of major customers. The Company has not incurred and does not expect to
incur  significant  credit losses.  Approximately  $73 million of trade accounts
receivable are due from automobile  dealers.  ADESA has possession of car titles
collaterallizing a significant portion of these accounts.

8 Common Stock and Retained Earnings
   The  Articles  of  Incorporation,  mortgage,  and  preferred  stock  purchase
agreements contain provisions that, under certain circumstances,  would restrict
the payment of common stock dividends. As of Dec. 31, 1995, no retained earnings
were restricted as a result of these provisions.

11 Short-Term Borrowings and Compensating Balances
   The  Company  had bank  lines of  credit,  which  make  short-term  financing
available  through  short-term  bank loans and provide  support  for  commercial
paper,  aggregating  $128 and $72 million at Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994. At Dec. 31,
1995 and 1994, the Company had issued  commercial  paper with face values of $63
and $54 million,  respectively,  with liquidity provided by bank lines of credit
and the Company's securities portfolio.  Certain lines of credit require payment
of a 1/8 of 1%  commitment  fee and others  require  maintenance  of a 5% or 10%
compensating  balance.  Interest rates on commercial  paper and borrowings under
the lines of credit range from 6.0% to 9.5% at Dec.  31, 1995,  and 5.5% to 9.5%
at Dec. 31, 1994. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings at
Dec.  31, 1995 and 1994,  was 6.1% and 5.7%.  The total  amount of  compensating
balances at Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994, was immaterial.

12 Square Butte Purchased Power Contract
   Under the terms of a 30-year  contract with Square Butte that extends through
2007,   the  Company  is  purchasing  71%  of  the  output  from  a  mine-mouth,
lignite-fired  generating  plant  capable  of  generating  up to  470  MW.  This
generating unit (Project) is located near Center,  N.D.  Reductions to about 49%
of the output are  provided  for in the  contract  and,  at the option of Square
Butte,  could begin after a five-year advance notice to the Company and continue
for the remaining  economic life of the Project.  The Company has the option but
not the obligation to continue to purchase 49% of the output after 2007.
   The Project is leased to Square Butte through Dec. 31, 2007, by certain banks
and their  affiliates  which have  beneficial  ownership in the Project.  Square
Butte has  options  to renew the lease  after  2007 for  essentially  the entire
remaining economic life of the Project.
   The Company is  obligated  to pay Square  Butte all Square  Butte's  leasing,
operating  and debt service costs (less any amounts  collected  from the sale of
power or energy to others)  that  shall not have been paid by Square  Butte when
due.  These costs  include the price of lignite  coal  purchased by Square Butte
under a cost-plus contract with BNI Coal. The Company's cost of power and energy
purchased  from Square  Butte during  1995,  1994 and 1993 was $57.6,  $55.4 and
$56.5 million,  respectively.  The leasing costs of Square Butte included in the
cost of power  delivered  to the Company  totaled  $19.3  million in 1995 and in
1994, and $19.7 million in 1993, which included approximately $11, $12 and $12.5
million,  respectively,  of interest expense. The annual fixed lease obligations
of the Company for Square Butte are $19.4  million from 1996  through  2000.  At
Dec. 31, 1995,  Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $207  million.  The
Company's  obligation is absolute and unconditional  whether or not any power is
actually delivered to the Company.
   The  Company's  payments to Square Butte for power and energy are approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.
   One principal reason the Company entered into the agreement with Square Butte
was to obtain a power supply for large  industrial  customers.  Present electric
service contracts with these customers require payment of minimum monthly demand
charges  that cover most of the fixed  costs  associated  with  having  capacity
available  to serve  them.  These  contracts  minimize  the  negative  impact on
earnings that could result from significant reductions in kilowatt-hour sales to
industrial  customers.  The  minimum  contract  term  for the  large  industrial
customers  is 10  years,  with a  four-year  cancellation  notice  required  for
termination  of the  contract at or beyond the end of the tenth year.  Under the
terms of existing  contracts,  the Company would collect  approximately  $100.5,
$90.9,  $79.0,  $61.8 and $48.1 million under current rate levels for firm power
during the years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, even if no power
or energy were  supplied to these  customers  after Dec. 31,  1995.  The minimum
contract  provisions are expressed in megawatts of demand,  and if rates change,
the  amounts  the  Company  would  collect  under the  contracts  will change in
proportion to the change in the demand rate.

13 Leasing Agreements
   ADESA leases auction facilities located in North Carolina,  Massachusetts and
Tennessee  from an unrelated  third party.  The term of these leases is for five
years with no renewal options.  However,  at the beginning of the fourth year of
the lease term,  ADESA has the option to  purchase  the leased  facilities  at a
collective  price of $26.5  million.  In the event ADESA does not  exercise  its
option to  purchase,  ADESA is required to  guarantee  any  deficiency  in sales
proceeds the lessor realizes in dispensing of the leased  properties  should the
selling price fall below $25.7 million. ADESA receives any excess sales proceeds
over the option price.
   ADESA has  guaranteed  the payment of principal  and interest on the lessor's
indebtedness  which consists of $25.7 million  mortgage notes, due Aug. 1, 2000.
Interest on the notes accrues at 9.82% per annum and is payable  monthly.  ADESA
had also  guaranteed  the completion of  construction  which took place at these
properties during 1995.
   The Company leases other properties and equipment in addition to those listed
above  pursuant to operating and capital lease  agreements  with terms  expiring
through 2002. Aggregate amounts of future minimum lease payments for capital and
operating  leases during each of the next five years are $6.6,  $6.5, $6.4, $9.2
and $3.4 million in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.

   In 1995,  based on the  results  of a project  which  analyzed  the  economic
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board
of directors of Lehigh  directed  management to dispose of Lehigh's  assets in a
manner  that would  maximize  the  utilization  of tax  benefits.  Based on this
directive,  Lehigh  recognized $18.4 million of income by reducing the valuation
reserve which offsets  deferred tax assets.  Additional  unrealized net deferred
tax assets  resulting  from the original  purchase of Lehigh of $8.2 million are
included on the Company's  balance  sheet.  These assets are fully offset by the
deferred tax asset valuation  allowance because under the standards of SFAS 109,
"Accounting  for Income Taxes," it is currently  "more likely than not" that the
value  of  these   assets  will  not  be   realized.   Management   reviews  the
appropriateness of the valuation allowance quarterly.
   A  provision  has not been  made  for  taxes on  $19.1  million  of  pre-1993
undistributed  earnings of Capital  Re, an  investment  accounted  for under the
equity  method.  Those  earnings  have been and are  expected  to continue to be
reinvested.  The Company  estimates that $7.9 million of tax would be payable on
the pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re if the Company should sell its
investment.  The Company has recognized  the income tax impact on  undistributed
earnings of Capital Re earned since Jan. 1, 1993.

15 Pension Plans and Benefits
   Pension  Plans.  The  Company's  Minnesota,  Wisconsin  and  Florida  utility
operations have noncontributory  defined benefit pension plans covering eligible
employees.  Pension  benefits for employees in Minnesota and Wisconsin are fully
vested  after  five  years and are  based on years of  service  and the  highest
average monthly  compensation  earned during four  consecutive  years within the
last 15 years of  employment.  Employees  in Florida are fully vested after five
years of credited  service,  with benefits based on years of service and average
earnings.   Company  policy  is  to  fund  accrued   pension  costs,   including
amortization of past service costs, over 5 to 30 years. Part of the pension cost
is capitalized as a cost of plant construction.

   Company  policy  is to fund the net  periodic  postretirement  costs  and the
amortization  of the costs  deferred as the amounts are collected in rates.  The
Company is funding these benefits using Voluntary  Employee Benefit  Association
(VEBA)  trusts and an  irrevocable  grantor  trust.  The maximum tax  deductible
contributions  are made to the VEBAs.  The  remainder of the funds are placed in
the irrevocable grantor trust until the funds can be used to make tax deductible
contributions  to the VEBAs.  The funds in the irrevocable  grantor trust do not
qualify as plan  assets for  purposes  of SFAS 106  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

   For measurement purposes, it was assumed per capita health care benefit costs
would increase 12.25% in 1995 and that cost increases would thereafter  decrease
1% each  year  until  stabilizing  at 5.25% in  2002.  Accelerating  the rate of
assumed  health  care  cost  increases  by 1% each  year  would  raise  the 1995
transition  obligation by $6.8 million and service and interest costs by a total
of  $1.1  million.  The  weighted  average  discount  rate  used  in  estimating
accumulated  postretirement benefit obligations was 7.75% for 1995 and 8.25% for
1994.  The expected  long-term  rate of return on plan assets was 8.75% for 1995
and 1994.
   Postemployment Benefits. The Company provides certain postemployment benefits
to employees and their dependents  during the time period  following  employment
but  before  retirement.  On  Jan.  1,  1994,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS  112,
"Employers'  Accounting  for  Postemployment  Benefits,"  which  recognizes  the
estimated future cost of providing  postemployment  benefits on an accrual basis
over the active  service life of  employees.  Adoption of SFAS 112 resulted in a
$2.2 million transition obligation.

16 Employee Stock Plans
   Employee Stock  Ownership Plan. The Company has sponsored an ESOP since 1975,
amending it in 1989 and 1990 to establish  two leveraged  accounts.  The Company
accounts for the ESOP in  accordance  with the  American  Institute of Certified
Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position 93-6 (SOP 93-6).
   The 1989 leveraged  ESOP account covers all nonunion  Minnesota and Wisconsin
employees  who work more than 1,000 hours per year and have one year of service.
The  ESOP  used  the  proceeds  from a $16.5  million  15-year  loan at  9.125%,
guaranteed by the Company,  to purchase 633,489 shares of Minnesota Power common
stock on the open market in early 1990.  These  shares  fund  employee  benefits
totaling not less than 2% of the participants' salaries.
   The 1990 leveraged ESOP account covers Minnesota and Wisconsin  employees who
participated  in the  non-leveraged  ESOP plan prior to Aug.  4, 1989.  The ESOP
issued a $75  million  promissory  note at  10.25%  with a term not to exceed 25
years to the Company  (Employer Loan) as consideration for 2.8 million shares of
newly issued  Minnesota  Power common stock in November  1990.  These shares are
used to fund a  benefit  at least  equal  to the  value  of the  following:  (a)
dividends on shares held in participants' 1990 leveraged ESOP accounts which are
used to make loan payments, and (b) the tax savings generated from deducting all
dividends  paid on shares  currently  in the ESOP which were held by the plan on
Aug. 4, 1989.
   The  loans  will be  repaid  with  dividends  received  by the  ESOP and with
employer  contributions.  ESOP  shares  acquired  with the loans were  initially
pledged  as  collateral  for the  loans.  The  ESOP  shares  are  released  from
collateral  and  allocated  to  participants  based on the portion of total debt
service paid in the year.
