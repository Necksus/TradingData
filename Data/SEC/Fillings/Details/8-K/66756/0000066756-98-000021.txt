ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference  is made to  Minnesota  Power & Light  Company's  (Minnesota  Power or
Company)  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December  31, 1997 for
background  information  on  the  following  updates  (1997  Form  10-K).  Cited
references are to the Company's 1997 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 1 - First Paragraph

On May 12, 1998 Minnesota  Power  shareholders  approved  changing the Company's
name to Minnesota Power,  Inc. The new name recognizes the Company's  transition
from a traditional  regional electric utility to a diversified  corporation that
serves a broad range of  customers  across  North  America.  The new name builds
logically  from the  Company's  current  identity and  preserves  the  Company's
Minnesota  heritage.  The new name is  expected to become  effective  on May 27,
1998.


Ref. Page 12 - Insert after Sixth Paragraph.


On May 11, 1998 Florida Water Services Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company,  signed an asset purchase and sale agreement to purchase Palm Coast
Utility  Corporation  (PCUC) from ITT  Industries,  Inc.  (ITT).  PCUC  provides
service  to 16,000  water and 14,000  wastewater  customers  in Flagler  County,
Florida.  The  Company  was  granted an option to acquire  PCUC in 1996 when the
Company  acquired  certain  real  estate  assets  from ITT in the  PCUC  service
territory.
