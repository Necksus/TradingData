ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December
31, 1999 (1999 Form 10-K) of Minnesota Power, Inc.  (Minnesota Power or Company)
for background  information on the following  update.  The cited reference is to
the Company's 1999 Form 10-K.

Ref. Page 12. - Insert After Third Full Paragraph

On June 20,  2000  ADESA  Corporation  (ADESA),  a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of
Minnesota  Power,  acquired the  outstanding  common  shares of Auction  Finance
Group, Inc. (AFG) from its  shareholders.  AFG, which is headquartered in Miami,
Florida,   owns  CAAG  Auto  Auction  Holdings  Ltd.,  a  wholesale   automotive
remarketing company with locations throughout Canada, doing business as Canadian
Auction Group (CAG).  This  acquisition  adds 13 vehicle auction  facilities and
associated dealer financing  business to ADESA's 4 existing  Canadian  locations
and establishes ADESA as the premier automotive  services company in Canada. For
the twelve months ended May 31, 2000,  CAG auctions sold  approximately  200,000
vehicles and generated $68 million (U.S. dollars) in revenue. The acquisition is
subject  to  post-closing review  by  Canadian  regulatory  authorities.  ADESA
operates  28 additional vehicle auction facilities throughout the United States.

On May 31, 2000 ADESA Canada Inc. (ADESA Canada),  a wholly owned  subsidiary of
ADESA,  purchased  the  remaining  27 percent of Impact Auto  Auctions  Ltd. and
Suburban Auto Parts Inc.  (collectively,  Impact Auto) from its partners.  ADESA
Canada  acquired  20  percent of Impact  Auto on October 1, 1995,  27 percent in
March 1999 and  another 26 percent in  January  2000.  Impact  Auto is  Canada's
largest national salvage auction chain with 11 sites in 6 provinces. Impact Auto
provides  remarketing  services to  insurance  companies  for their "total loss"
vehicles.

The  May and June 2000 transactions  described  in the two  preceding paragraphs
had a  combined purchase  price of  approximately  $160  million.  The  Company
will fund these transactions  with  proceeds from the sale of ACE Limited  (ACE)
shares  and proceeds from the Company's securities portfolio.

Ref. Page 16. - Third Paragraph

In May 2000 Minnesota Power recorded a $30.4 million  after-tax gain on the sale
of its 4.7 million  shares of ACE.  Minnesota  Power received the ACE shares and
$25 million in cash in December  1999 when Capital Re  Corporation  (Capital Re)
merged with ACE.  The merger  resulted  in a $36.2  million  after-tax  non-cash
charge the Company recorded in 1999. Prior to the merger,  Minnesota Power owned
7.3 million shares,  or 20 percent,  of Capital Re. Minnesota Power has now sold
its entire  investment in ACE. The $127 million in proceeds from the sale of ACE
shares and proceeds from the Company's securities portfolio will be used to fund
the acquisitions of AFG and Impact Auto.
