Item 5.    Other Events.

A.   Southern States Utilities Receives Final Rate Order
     On November 1, 1996 the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) issued its
final order in the Southern  States  Utilities,  Inc. (SSU) rate case. The order
officially  established  water and  wastewater  rates for all  customers  of SSU
regulated  by the FPSC.  The new rates,  which  became  effective  for  services
rendered on and after September 20, 1996, will result in an annualized  increase
of approximately $11.1 million in revenue. This increase includes, and is not in
addition to, the $7.9 million increase in annualized  revenue granted as interim
rates  effective  for  services  rendered  on and after  January 23,  1996.  SSU
requested an $18.1 million rate increase in June 1995.
     On November 1, 1996 SSU filed with the First  District  Court of Appeals an
appeal of the FPSC order seeking  judicial  review of key issues relating to the
amount of investment  in utility  facilities  recoverable  in rates from current
customers.
     Florida law provides that the new rates be  implemented  while the order is
under  appeal.  SSU is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Minnesota  Power & Light
Company (Minnesota Power).

B.   ADESA Adds Two New Auto Auction Locations
     On November 1, 1996 ADESA Corporation  (ADESA),  the nation's third largest
provider of wholesale vehicle remarketing services and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Minnesota  Power,  announced the  acquisition  of Gulf States Auto Auction in
Dallas, Texas. This auction facility is located in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite
and will be known as ADESA  Dallas.  It is  situated  on a 31 acre site,  and is
equipped with six lanes and full service reconditioning  facilities. The auction
has been in  operation  since 1990 and, in three of the last four years,  it has
ranked as the top volume program car auction for Toyota Motor Sales, USA.
     On  November  6,  1996  ADESA  acquired  substantially  all the  assets  of
Interstate Auto Auctions, Inc. in Mercer, Pennsylvania. The new ADESA subsidiary
will be known as ADESA Pittsburgh.  This auction,  which has conducted  business
for over 25 years,  operates on 54 acres,  features seven auction lanes,  and is
equipped with full service reconditioning facilities.
     Both  acquisitions are consistent with ADESA's strategic plan to accelerate
the growth and profitability of ADESA and improve operating efficiencies.  ADESA
now owns and  operates 25  automobile  auctions in the United  States and Canada
through  which used cars and other  vehicles are sold to  franchised  automobile
dealers and licensed used car dealers.
