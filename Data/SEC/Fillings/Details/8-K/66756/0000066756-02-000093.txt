                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this Form 8-K, in presentations, in response to questions or
otherwise.   Any  statements  that  express,   or  involve  discussions  as  to,
expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions  or  future  events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"projects,"  "will likely result," "will continue" or similar  expressions)  are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

  -  war and acts of terrorism;
  -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of
     the  United  States  Congress,  state  legislatures,   the  Federal  Energy
     Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission,  the
     Florida Public Service Commission, the North Carolina Utilities Commission,
     the Public Service  Commission of Wisconsin and various county  regulators,
     about allowed  rates of return,  financings,  industry and rate  structure,
     acquisition   and  disposal  of  assets  and   facilities,   operation  and
     construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital
     investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail  competition
     (including  but not  limited  to  transmission  costs)  as well as  general
     vehicle-related laws, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws;
  -  unanticipated   impacts  of  restructuring   initiatives  in  the  electric
     industry;
  -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;
  -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;
  -  weather conditions;
  -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;
  -  the  effects  of  competition,  including  the  competition for  retail and
     wholesale customers, as well as suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;
  -  pricing and transportation of commodities;
  -  market demand, including structural market changes;
  -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
  -  unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;
  -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
  -  capital market conditions;
  -  competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;
  -  our ability to manage expansion and integrate recent acquisitions; and
  -  the  outcome  of  legal  and administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or
     criminal) and  settlements  that affect the business and  profitability  of
     ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                       ALLETE REPORTS SOLID THIRD QUARTER
                       ----------------------------------


Duluth, Minn. - ALLETE, Inc. (NYSE: ALE) today reported earnings of 55 cents per
share for the third quarter of 2002, compared with 47 cents over the comparable
period a year ago, an increase of 17 percent. Net income was $45.1 million, up
19 percent from the third quarter of 2001. Operating revenue was $390 million in
the quarter compared with $383.1 million a year ago. Year-to-date, earnings are
$1.46 per share, compared with $1.50 for the first nine months of 2001.
Excluding exit charges related to the vehicle transport business and Electric
Odyssey, year-to-date earnings per share are $1.51 this year.

"We reported earnings comparable to last year despite difficult market
conditions for both the energy and automotive businesses," said Dave Gartzke,
ALLETE Chairman, President and CEO. "We are confident that the company is
well-positioned to contend with current market conditions and will show stronger
earnings performance once the economic environment improves."

While total kilowatt-hour sales increased 24 percent, earnings at ENERGY
SERVICES for the quarter were down three percent compared to a year ago due to
weak wholesale power prices. Revenue and earnings from our core retail electric
business remain strong.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES in the third quarter were flat compared with
the comparable period in 2001.

Earnings at AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES increased by $3.5 million for the quarter
compared with the third quarter of 2001. At ADESA, growth was due to mandated
goodwill accounting changes, lower interest expense and increased auction
efficiency. Total receivables at Automotive Finance Corporation have increased
by eight percent over 2001 to $535 million, and its strong credit quality helped
AFC post another strong quarter. Year-to-date, net income for Automotive
Services is 33 percent over the same period last year.

"In the first few weeks of October we were surprised to see conversion rates
fall to 50 percent at our U.S. auctions," Gartzke said. "New car manufacturers
have extended zero-percent financing into the 2003 model year, causing a further
reduction in wholesale used car prices. This has slowed the sale of vehicles at
our auctions."

The conversion rate represents the number of vehicles sold compared with the
number of vehicles offered at auction.

"We expect the sellers of used cars will ultimately accept the lower prices at
auction and begin selling again," Gartzke said. "But timing is uncertain. Based
on current market conditions we believe Automotive Services will not achieve its
stated earnings growth goal of 30 percent this year. We now expect ALLETE's
earnings per share to be at the low end of the range with respect to our
estimate for 2002 of $1.80 to $1.90."

ALLETE's corporate headquarters are located in Duluth, Minnesota. ALLETE's
holdings include ADESA, the second largest wholesale automobile auction network
in North America; AFC, the leading provider of independent auto dealer inventory
financing; Minnesota Power, a low-cost electric utility that serves some of the
largest industrial customers in the United States; and significant real estate
holdings in Florida. For more information about ALLETE, visit the company's Web
