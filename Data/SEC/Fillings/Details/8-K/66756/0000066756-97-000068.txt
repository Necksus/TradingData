     Square Butte Electric Cooperative (Square Butte) which extends through 2007, pursuant to which the Company is purchasing
     71 percent of the output of a generating unit capable of generating up to 470 megawatts. The Company is obligated to pay
     Square Butte all of Square Butte's leasing and operating and debt service costs, less any amount collected from the sale
     of power or energy to others, which shall not have been paid by Square Butte when due. (See Note 17 to the Company's 1996
     Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in the Company's 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K.)
