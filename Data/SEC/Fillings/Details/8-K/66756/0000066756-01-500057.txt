ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the 2000 Form 10-K of ALLETE,  Inc. (ALLETE) for background
information  on  the  following  update.   Unless  otherwise  indicated,   cited
references are to ALLETE's 2000 Form 10-K.

Ref. Page 26 - Third Full Paragraph
Ref. Form 8-K dated and filed May 18, 2001

On October 10, 2001 Minnesota Power, a business of ALLETE, and  Cleveland-Cliffs
Inc.  (Cleveland-Cliffs)  announced  that they have  executed an Asset  Purchase
Agreement  with LTV Steel  Mining  Company  (LTV).  Under terms of the  purchase
agreement,  a subsidiary of  Cleveland-Cliffs  would pay $12.5 million to LTV to
acquire the taconite  processing  plant along with all of LTV's property that is
related to mining operations.  Rainy River Energy Corporation - Taconite Harbor,
a wholly owned  subsidiary of ALLETE,  would pay $75 million in total to LTV and
Cleveland-Cliffs  to  acquire  certain  non-mining   properties  from  LTV.  The
non-mining  properties include LTV's electric  generating  facility and existing
coal pile at Taconite Harbor, a sixty-mile  transmission line, railroad trackage
rights,  and  approximately  30,000  acres  of  forest  and  recreation  land in
northeast Minnesota. The purchase agreement is subject to approval from the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court and satisfaction of other closing conditions.

                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE which are made in this Form 8-K, in presentations,  in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond the control of ALLETE and may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

     -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those
        of the United States Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal Energy
        Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,  the
        Florida  Public  Service   Commission,   the  North  Carolina  Utilities
        Commission,  the Public  Service  Commission  of  Wisconsin  and various
        county  regulators,  about  allowed  rates of return,  industry and rate
        structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, operation
        and  construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and
        capital  investments,  and present or  prospective  wholesale and retail
        competition (including but not limited to transmission costs);

     -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

     -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
        policies;

     -  weather conditions;

     -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;

     -  competition for retail and wholesale customers;

     -  pricing and transportation of commodities;

     -  market demand, including structural market changes;

     -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

     -  changes in project costs;

     -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

     -  capital market conditions;

     -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and

     -  legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and
        settlements that influence the business and profitability of ALLETE.


Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.
