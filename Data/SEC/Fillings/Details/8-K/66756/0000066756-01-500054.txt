ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the 2000 Form 10-K of ALLETE, Inc. (ALLETE) for background
information on the following update.

Ref. Page 43 - Tenth Paragraph

On September 10, 2001 ALLETE Water Services,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
ALLETE,  received  a letter  from the  Florida  Governmental  Utility  Authority
(Authority) expressing interest in engaging in discussions regarding a potential
purchase by the Authority of all of the water, wastewater and water reuse assets
of Florida Water Services Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ALLETE Water
Services.  The Authority is an innovative  home rule mechanism  available  under
Florida  law  enacted in 1999  permitting  local  governmental  entities to join
together to acquire,  finance,  own and operate water or  wastewater  utilities.
ALLETE Water  Services  notified the Authority  that,  consistent  with ALLETE's
stated  goals to find new  ways to  maximize  shareholder  value,  ALLETE  would
explore the  feasibility  of such a transaction.  ALLETE Water Services  entered
into an agreement  giving the  Authority  the  exclusive  opportunity  until and
including  December  21,  2001 to  review a  potential  transaction.  ALLETE  is
evaluating  strategic  and  financial  alternatives  with  respect to all of its
various businesses.

                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE which are made in this Form 8-K, in presentations,  in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond the control of ALLETE and may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

   -  prevailing governmental policies and  regulatory actions,  including those
      of the United States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal  Energy
      Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota  Public Utilities  Commission,  the
      Florida  Public   Service   Commission,   the  North  Carolina   Utilities
      Commission,  the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and various county
      regulators,  about allowed rates of return,  industry and rate  structure,
      acquisition  and  disposal  of  assets  and   facilities,   operation  and
      construction of plant facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital
      investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail competition
      (including but not limited to transmission costs);

   -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

   -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;

   -  weather conditions;

   -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;

   -  competition for retail and wholesale customers;

   -  pricing and transportation of commodities;

   -  market demand, including structural market changes;

   -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

   -  changes in project costs;

   -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

   -  capital market conditions;

   -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and

   -  legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and
      settlements that influence the business and profitability of ALLETE.


Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.
