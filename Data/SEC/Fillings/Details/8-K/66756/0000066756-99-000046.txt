ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December
31, 1998 (1998 Form 10-K) of Minnesota Power, Inc.  (Minnesota Power or Company)
for background  information on the following  update.  The cited reference is to
the Company's 1998 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 22. - Fifth and Six Paragraphs
Ref. Form 8-K dated and filed May 27, 1999
Ref. Form 8-K dated and filed June 15, 1999
Ref. 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 Page 11. - Fifth through Seventh
Paragraph

Minnesota  Power  owns 7.3  million  shares,  or 19.9  percent,  of  Capital  Re
Corporation  (Capital  Re).  On June 10, 1999  Capital Re and ACE Limited  (ACE)
signed an agreement  providing for the merger of Capital Re with ACE.  Under the
terms of the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger  (Merger  Agreement),  Capital  Re's
shareholders  would receive 0.6 ordinary shares of ACE for each share of Capital
Re at closing,  subject to a maximum value to Capital Re shareholders of $22 per
share.

On October 6, 1999 Capital Re received an unsolicited all-cash acquisition offer
from XL Capital Ltd. (XL Capital).  To consider XL Capital's  offer,  Capital Re
postponed  its  October 7, 1999  shareholder  meeting at which there was to be a
vote on the proposed  merger with ACE.  Capital Re has since  received  from ACE
proposed  amendments  to the  Merger  Agreement  and  competing  offers  from XL
Capital. Minnesota Power is unable to predict the timing or acceptance of any
offer.

Minnesota  Power's  financial  results for the quarter and six months ended June
30, 1999 included a $24.1 million non-cash charge. The non-cash charge reflected
an estimated Capital Re valuation of $17 per share based on ACE's stock price at
that  time  and the  exchange  ratio  in the ACE  Merger  Agreement.  Additional
adjustments to Minnesota Power's  investment in Capital Re will be recognized at
the time when a Capital Re transaction is finalized,  and subsequently  when any
stock received from the  transaction is sold.  Minnesota  Power accounts for its
investment in Capital Re as an available-for-sale security.

Capital Re is a financial guaranty  reinsurance and specialty  insurance company
that trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KRE. ACE through its
subsidiaries, provides a broad range of insurance and reinsurance products for a
diverse  group of  international  clients.  ACE  trades  on the New  York  Stock
Exchange   under  the  symbol  ACL.  XL  Capital,   through  its  wholly   owned
subsidiaries,  provides  excess  liability  insurance  coverage  to  industrial,
commercial  and other  enterprises.  XL  Capital  trades  on the New York  Stock
Exchange under the symbol XL.
