Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

   Minnesota  Power has  operations  in four  business  segments:  (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
services,  which include water and wastewater services; (3) automotive services,
which include auctions, a finance company and an auto transport company; and (4)
investments,  which include a securities portfolio, a 21% equity investment in a
financial guaranty reinsurance company and real estate operations.
   Earnings  Per Share.  Earnings  per share of common  stock were $2.28 in 1996
compared to $2.16 in 1995 and $2.06 in 1994. An increase in the number of shares
of common stock  outstanding in 1996 diluted 1996 earnings by 7 cents per share.
The dilution  reduced  electric  operations  earnings  per share 4 cents,  water
services 1 cent and investments 4 cents,  and increased by 2 cents per share the
negative impact on earnings attributable to corporate charges.  Return on common
equity was 11.3%, 10.7% and 10.5% for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

   Electric operations earnings per share in 1996 were down slightly due to a 3%
decrease in sales to the Company's large power customers and the dilutive effect
of the increase in common stock  outstanding.  The decrease was partially offset
by sales to other customers.  The performance of water services in 1996 improved
over 1995  primarily  as a result of rate  relief and ongoing  cost  controls at
Florida Water.  1996 earnings from automotive  services reflect twelve months of
results while only six months are included in 1995 earnings.  1996 earnings also
reflect  growth in AFC's  floorplan  financing  business  and an increase in the
number of automobiles auctioned by ADESA. 1996 earnings from automotive services
were  tempered in part by start-up  losses at two new  auction  facilities.  The
contribution  of the  Company's  investments  was lower in 1996  because (i) the
average securities  portfolio balance was smaller in 1996 since a portion of the
portfolio  was  sold in 1995 to fund the  purchase  of  ADESA  and  (ii)  Lehigh
recognized  22 cents per share  compared to 52 cents of tax benefits in 1996 and
1995,  respectively.  Corporate  charges  in 1995  included a 14 cents per share
write-off of the Company's investment in Reach All.
   Electric operations contributed the same amount to earnings per share in 1995
compared to 1994. This reflected lower demand charges from large power customers
which were offset by increased  sales. The performance of water services in 1995
compared  to 1994  reflected  lower  water  sales in Florida in 1995 due to high
rainfall  during the year. The 1994  performance of water services was favorably
impacted  by a 42 cent per  share  gain  from the sale of  certain  water  plant
assets.  Real estate  operations  in 1994  reflected 13 cents per share from the
recognition  of escrow funds.  Portfolio and  reinsurance  in 1994 included a 21
cent per share write-off of a securities  investment.  Corporate charges in 1994
included an 11 cent per share loss from the Company's investment in Reach All.
   Discontinued  operations  included  results from the paper and pulp  business
which was sold in June 1995. The increase in income from discontinued operations
reflected higher paper and pulp prices in 1995.

Consolidated Financial Review

   Operating Revenue and Income.  Electric operations revenue was higher in 1996
compared to 1995 due to a 14%  increase in total kWh sales,  setting a new sales
record  for the  second  year in a row.  The  increase  in sales  is  attributed
primarily to MPEX,  the  Company's  new  wholesale  marketing  division  that is
selling  energy,  capacity  and  brokering  services to other  power  suppliers.
Extreme  winter  weather in 1996 compared to the milder winter in 1995 increased
sales to  residential  and  commercial  customers  and reduced sales to taconite
producers.
   Revenue  in 1995 was  higher  than 1994  because  of  increased  kWh sales to
industrial  customers,  higher  commercial  and  residential  rates,  and  a 37%
increase in kWh sales for resale.  One major taconite  electric  customer of the
Company operated all year in 1995 and only four months in 1994.
   Water services  revenue and income was higher in 1996 compared to 1995 due to
higher rates, a 9% increase in consumption,  gains from the sale of assets,  and
the  inclusion  of $5.3  million of revenue from ISI.  Florida  Water,  formerly
Southern States Utilities,  Inc., implemented an interim rate increase effective
Jan. 23,  1996,  and final rates  effective  Sept.  20, 1996,  in total an $11.1
million  annual  increase.  Florida Water added 17,000 new water and  wastewater
customers  as a result of the  December  1995  purchase  of the assets of Orange
Osceola in Florida.  A 2% growth in customers and normal  consumption due to the
return of more typical  weather in Florida both  contributed  to higher sales in
1996.  Heater,  which owns 

                                       -3-
<PAGE>
and  operates  the  Company's  water  operations  in North  Carolina  and  South
Carolina,  made a strategic  decision to withdraw from South Carolina,  sold the
majority  of its assets in that  state and  recognized  $1.7  million in pre-tax
gains  during  1996.  In April 1996 the Company  purchased  ISI, a company  that
specializes in predictive maintenance of water supply equipment.

   Operating  revenue in 1995 was lower than 1994 due to 15,000 fewer  customers
following the December 1994 sale of the Venice Gardens'  assets in Florida.  The
sale resulted in a $19.1 million gain in 1994. High rainfall in parts of Florida
and customer water  conservation  efforts also lowered operating revenue in 1995
and 1994.
   Automotive  services  operating  revenue and income is included as of July 1,
1995,  the  purchase  date of ADESA.  In  addition  to  including a full year of
operations,  operating revenue and income was higher in 1996 because ADESA added
eight new auction  sites during the year and sold more than 600,000 cars in 1996
compared  to 230,000  cars during the last six months of 1995  (470,000  cars in
total were sold by ADESA in 1995).  Ancillary  services,  such as transportation
and reconditioning, and the expansion of AFC also contributed to revenue growth.
   Investments  revenue  and  income was  higher in 1996 due to  increased  real
estate sales in Florida.  Lehigh  purchased  properties at Palm Coast in Florida
and expanded its  marketing  program  nationwide.  Also  included in  investment
income is the contribution of the securities portfolio. Due to a smaller average
portfolio  balance  resulting  from the sale of  approximately  $60  million  of
securities to finance the ADESA purchase, the contribution was lower.
   Investments  revenue and income in 1996 reflected an after-tax return of 8.8%
compared to 9.2% in 1995 and 3.8% in 1994. The 1994 after-tax  return included a
$10.1 million write-off of a securities investment. Operating revenue and income
from real  estate  operations  was lower in 1995  compared  to 1994 due to fewer
commercial land sales and Lehigh's maturing accounts  receivable  portfolio.  In
1994 Lehigh recognized in revenue $4.5 million of escrow funds.
   Operating  Expenses.  Fuel and purchased  power  expenses were higher in 1996
than 1995 because of a 14%  increase in kWh sold.  Sales for resale were up over
48% due to the marketing  efforts  initiated by MPEX in 1996.  These expenses in
1995 were higher than 1994 because of a 13% increase in kWh sold.
   Operations  expenses  were higher in 1996  reflecting  $91 million for a full
year of automotive  services'  operations compared to $31 million for six months
in 1995.  ADESA  added  eight  auctions  which  contributed  to the  increase in
operations  expense in 1996.  Expenses  in 1995 were higher than 1994 due to the
inclusion of automotive  services,  scheduled  electric  maintenance  costs, and
increased  expenses  related  to  conservation  improvement  programs  (CIP) and
customer services.
   Administrative  and  general  expenses  were  higher in 1996  reflecting  $73
million  for a full  year of  automotive  services  operations  compared  to $27
million for six months in 1995.  Medical  plan  expenses for  employees  and the
amortization  of  an  early  retirement  program  offered  to  electric  utility
employees in 1995 also increased expenses in 1996.  Expenses in 1995 were higher
than 1994 due to the  addition of  automotive  services'  expenses  totaling $27
million  and salary  and  benefit  increases  company-wide.  Salary and  benefit
increases  were  tempered  by lower  payroll  costs  associated  with the  early
retirement program.
   Interest  expense was higher in 1996 due primarily to a $30 million  increase
in outstanding  long-term  indebtedness related to the addition and expansion of
automotive services.  In addition,  the average short-term  indebtedness balance
was higher by $60 million in 1996.
   Income  from  equity  investments  of  $11.8  million  in 1996  was  from the
Company's 21% ownership interest in Capital Re compared to $9.8 and $8.1 million
in 1995 and 1994. Income from equity  investments in 1995 and 1994 also included
losses from Reach All of $6.4 and $5.2  million,  respectively,  a business  the
Company exited in 1995.
   Income tax  expense in 1996 and 1995  included  the  recognition  of $8.2 and
$18.4  million,  respectively,  of tax  benefits  associated  with  real  estate
operations in Florida.  Excluding these tax benefits,  the effective tax rate in
1996 and 1995 was 31% compared to 26% in 1994.

Electric Operations

   Electric operations generate,  transmit,  distribute, and market electricity.
Minnesota  Power  provides  electricity  to 121,000  customers  in  northeastern
Minnesota,  while the Company's wholly owned subsidiary,  Superior Water,  Light
and Power  Company,  sells  electricity  to 14,000  customers and natural gas to
11,000 customers,  and provides water to 10,000  customers,  all in northwestern
Wisconsin.  Another  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  BNI Coal,  owns and  operates a
lignite  coal  mine in  North  Dakota.  Two  electric  generating  cooperatives,
Minnkota Power Cooperative,  Inc. and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI
Coal's production of lignite coal under contracts  extending to 2027.

   Electric Sales.  Kilowatthour  sales in 1996 of 13.2 billion  exceeded 1995's
record-setting  level of 11.5 billion kWh. Minnesota Power formally  established
MPEX as a new  division in early 1996.  MPEX is an  expansion  of the  Company's
inter-utility  marketing group which has been a buyer and seller of capacity and
energy for 25 years in the  wholesale  power  market.  The customers of MPEX are
other power  suppliers  in the Midwest and  Canada.  MPEX  contracts  to provide
hourly energy scheduling and power trading services.  MPEX is credited with most
of the increase in kWh sales.
   The two major industries in Minnesota  Power's service territory are taconite
production, and paper and wood products manufacturing. Taconite mining customers
accounted for 32% of electric  operating revenue in 1996, 35% in 1995 and 34% in
1994.  The paper and wood  products  industries  accounted  for 11% of  electric
operating  revenue  in  1996,  12% in 1995  and 13% in 1994.  Sales  for  resale
accounted for 13% of electric  operating  revenue in 1996 compared to 9% in 1995
and 8% in 1994.
   Taconite is an important raw material for the steel industry and is made from
low iron content ore mined in northern Minnesota. Taconite processing plants use
large  quantities of electric  power to grind the ore and  concentrate  the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 46
million tons in 1996 compared to 47 million in 1995 and 43 million tons in 1994.
Minnesota's  taconite  production  in 1997 is  expected to be  approximately  47
million  tons.  During 1996 and early 1997 the Company  successfully  negotiated
extended contracts with several customers including two of the Company's largest
customers, USX and Inland Steel.
   While  taconite  production  is expected to continue at annual levels over 40
million tons,  the long-term  future of this cyclical  industry is less certain.
Production may decline gradually some time after the year 2005.
   Large Power  Customer  Contracts.  Electric  service  contracts with 11 large
power  industrial  customers  require  payment of minimum monthly demand charges
that cover fixed costs associated with having capacity  available to serve them,
including  a  return  on  common  equity.  The  demand  charge  is paid by these
customers even if no electrical  energy is taken.  An energy charge is also paid
to cover the variable  cost of energy  actually  used. A four-year  cancellation
notice is required  to  terminate  the  contracts.  The rates and  corresponding
revenue  associated  with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are
subject to change through the regulatory  process  governing all retail electric
rates.

Summary of Minimum Revenue and Demand Under Contract as of February 1, 1997

   The Company believes revenue from large power customers will be substantially
in excess of the minimum contract amounts.

   The 11 large  power  customers  each  require 10 MW or more of power and have
contract  termination  dates ranging from October 1999 to December 2007. Five of
these  customers  are  taconite  producers,  four are  paper  and wood  products
manufacturers and two are pipeline companies.  In addition to the minimum demand
provisions,  the contracts  with the taconite  producers and pipeline  companies
require these customers to purchase their entire electric  service  requirements
from the Company.  Six of the large power customers purchase a combined total of
200 MW of interruptible service pursuant to contract amendments incorporating an
interruptible  rate  schedule.   Under  this  schedule  and  pursuant  to  these
amendments,  the Company has the right to serve 100 MW of these customers' needs
through Oct.  31, 2008,  and another 100 MW of these  customers'  needs  through
April  30,  2010.  The  Company  has the  right  of  first  refusal  to serve an
additional 200 MW during these same time periods.
   Fuel. The cost of coal is the Company's  largest single operating  expense in
generating electricity. Coal consumption at the Company's generating stations in
1996 was 4.3  million  tons.  Minnesota  Power  currently  has three coal supply
agreements in place with Montana  suppliers.  Two terminate in December 1999 and
the other in December 2000.  Under these  agreements the Company has the tonnage
flexibility to procure between 55% and 100% of its total coal requirements.  The
Company uses this flexibility to purchase coal under spot-market agreements when
favorable  market  conditions  exist.  The Company  continues to explore  future
supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous
coal will continue to be available.  The Company has contracts  with  Burlington
Northern  Railroad to deliver  coal from  Montana  and Wyoming to the  Company's
generating facilities in Minnesota through December 2003.
   Purchased  Power  Contract.  Under an agreement  extending  through 2007 with
Square  Butte,  Minnesota  Power  purchases  71% (about 320 MW during the summer
months  and 333 MW during  the  winter  months)  of the  output of a  mine-mouth
generating unit located near 

                                       -5-
<PAGE>
Center, North Dakota. The Square Butte unit is one of two lignite-fired units at
Minnkota Power Cooperative's Milton R. Young Generating Station.
   Square Butte has the option,  upon five years advance  notice,  to reduce the
Company's  share of the unit's  output to 49%.  Minnesota  Power has the option,
though  not the  obligation,  to  continue  to  purchase  49% of the  output  at
market-based  prices  after  2007  to  the  end of the  plant's  economic  life.
Minnesota  Power must pay any Square Butte costs and expenses that have not been
paid by Square Butte when due, regardless of whether or not the Company receives
any power from that unit.
   Early  Retirement  Plan and  Workforce  Reduction.  In late 1996 the  Company
reduced its workforce in electric  operations by 4%. In 1995 an early retirement
offer to electric utility employees  resulted in a 12% reduction of the electric
operations  workforce,  at a cost of  approximately  $15 million  which is being
amortized  over 3 years.  The  workforce  reductions  are part of the  Company's
ongoing efforts to control costs and maintain low electric rates.
   Competition.  The electric utility industry is changing at both the wholesale
and retail levels. The enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 resulted in an
increase in the  competitive  forces that affect three of the four components of
the electric utility industry: generation, transmission and power marketing. The
fourth  component,  local  distribution,  is subject to state  regulation.  This
legislation has resulted in a more competitive market for electricity  generally
and particularly in wholesale markets. Wholesale deregulation is underway, while
retail  deregulation of the industry is being considered at both the Federal and
state  level,  and is  affecting  the way the  Company  strategically  views the
future.  With  electric  rates  among the  lowest  in the US and with  long-term
wholesale and large power retail contracts in place, Minnesota Power believes it
is well positioned to address competitive pressures.
   Wholesale.  During  1996   the Company  completed  functional  unbundling  of
operations   under  the  requirements  of  FERC's  Order  No.  888  Open  Access
Transmission Rules. Order No. 888 requires public utilities to take transmission
service for their own wholesale transactions under the same terms and conditions
on which  transmission  service is  provided to third  parties.  The Company has
filed its open access  transmission tariff with the FERC, and expects to receive
final FERC rate approval  early in 1997. The Company has also filed its "Code of
Conduct" under FERC's Order No. 889 Open Access Same Time Information System and
Standards of Conduct to formalize the functional  separation of generation  from
transmission within the organization. As a result, the transmission component of
Minnesota Power's electric utility business is well organized for, and has begun
to operate under, these new federal regulatory requirements.
   Minnesota  Power's  newly formed MPEX division  currently  conducts the power
marketing  function.  FERC  approval  of  Minnesota  Power's  market-based  rate
authority  enabled  MPEX to  conduct a  successful  wholesale  power and  energy
marketing business in 1996. During 1996, MPEX also completed  compliance filings
under FERC's Open Access Transmission Rules to separately state the transmission
component of the Company's coordination sales agreements,  and is awaiting final
FERC  approvals.  MPEX continues to review new strategic  opportunities  for its
wholesale  marketing  operations  in light of the new Open  Access  Transmission
Rules  enacted  by FERC and of the new  power  and  energy  markets  within  the
Mid-Continent Area Power Pool.
   Retail.  In 1995 the MPUC  initiated an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  in the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery  of  electric   service   continues  to  be  efficient   following  any
restructuring,  the MPUC adopted 15 principles to guide a deliberate and orderly
approach to developing  reasonable  restructuring  alternatives  that ensure the
fairness of a  competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January
1996  the  MPUC  established  a  competition  working  group  in  which  company
representatives  have participated in addressing issues related to wholesale and
retail  competition.  Minnesota Power has  implemented a key account  management
process and anticipates  continuing  negotiations  with its large industrial and
commercial customers to explore contractual options to lower energy costs. These
customers  continue  to  aggressively  seek  lower  energy  costs  and  consider
alternative suppliers in anticipation of deregulated retail markets.
   Legislation.  In 1997 Congress and the Minnesota  legislature are expected to
continue  to debate  proposed  legislation  which,  if  enacted,  would  promote
customer choice and a more competitive  electric market. The Company is actively
participating  in the  dialogue  and debate on these  issues in various  forums,
principally to advocate fairness and parity for all power and energy competitors
in any  deregulated  markets  that may be  created by any new  legislation.  The
Company  cannot predict the timing or substance of any  legislation  which might
ultimately be enacted.  However,  the Company continues taking steps to maintain
its  competitive  position as a low-cost  supplier and  maintain  its  long-term
contracts  with large  industrial  customers.  The  Company  is also  advocating
property tax reform before the Minnesota  legislature  in order to eliminate the
taxation of personal  property that results in an inequitable  tax burden among
current  and  potential  competitors  in  local  markets. Finally, SWL&P is
participating in the electric restructuring 


                                       -6-
<PAGE>
investigation before the PSCW,  which is advising the  Wisconsin  legislature on
recommended restructuring in Wisconsin.
   Conservation.  Minnesota  requires  electric  utilities to spend a minimum of
1.5% of annual retail  electric  revenue on  conservation  improvement  programs
(CIP) each year. An annually  approved billing  adjustment  combined with retail
base rates allow the Company to recover both costs of energy-saving programs and
"lost margins" associated with power saved as a result of such programs.
   The  Company's  largest  conservation  programs  are targeted at taconite and
paper  customers to promote  their  efficient  use of energy.  CIP also provides
demand-side  management  grants on a competitive  basis to commercial  and small
industrial  customers,  low-cost  financing for energy-saving  investments,  and
promotes energy conservation for all residential and commercial customers. SWL&P
also offers  electric and gas  conservation  programs to qualified  customers as
approved by the PSCW.
   Clean Air Act. While many utilities and their  customers will face high costs
to comply  with  clean-air  legislation,  the  Company  expects  to meet  future
requirements  without  major  spending.  By  burning  low-sulfur  fuels in units
equipped with pollution  control  equipment,  the Company's power plants already
operate at or near the sulfur dioxide  emission  limits set for the year 2000 by
the Federal Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990.  To meet  nitrogen  oxide  emission
limits for 2000, the Company expects to install new burner  technology and other
associated equipment at a cost of $6 million.
   1996 to 1995  Comparison.  Operating  revenue from  electric  operations  was
higher in 1996  compared to 1995 due to a 14%  increase in total kWh sales.  The
increase in sales is attributed  primarily to the Company's  marketing of energy
to other power  suppliers as well as extreme  winter weather in 1996 compared to
the milder winter in 1995. Revenue from sales of electricity was up in 1996, but
provided  lower  margins due to the cooler summer  weather in 1996  resulting in
more competitive  wholesale pricing.  Square Butte, one of Minnesota Power's low
priced sources of energy, produced 23% more energy in 1996, after being down for
scheduled  maintenance  in 1995.  Costs  associated  with the  early  retirement
offering in mid-1995  are being  amortized  over three  years.  Expenses in 1996
included  twelve months of  amortization,  while 1995 included only five months.
Employee and customer related expenses were higher in 1996. The Company measures
the profitability of its operations  through careful budgeting and monitoring of
contributions by segment to corporate  earnings per share.  Electric  operations
contributed  $1.32 to earnings  per share in 1996  compared to $1.36 in 1995 and
1994.  The per share amount in 1996 was  slightly  lower due to a 3% decrease in
sales to the Company's  large power  customers and the 4 cent dilutive effect of
the increase in common stock outstanding.   The decrease was partially offset by
sales to other customers.  The contribution from electric operations is expected
to remain stable in the future as the industry continues to deregulate. Electric
operations  will  continue  to seek  additional  cost  saving  alternatives  and
efficiencies  and expand  unregulated  services to maintain its  contribution to
earnings.
   1995 to 1994  Comparison.  Like 1996, 1995 was an excellent year for electric
operations.  The Company set records for electric sales, revenue and generation.
Operating revenue from electric  operations was higher in 1995 compared to 1994,
due to a 13% increase in total kWh sales, increased retail rates  and collection
of CIP  expenditures.  Warm  summer  weather  and  increased  demand  from large
industrial  customers and other power  suppliers  significantly  increased sales
over 1994.

Water Services

   Water  services  include  Florida  Water,  Heater and ISI, three wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company.  Florida Water provides water to 120,000  customers
and  wastewater  treatment  services  to 54,000  customers  in  Florida.  Heater
provides water to 22,000  customers and wastewater  treatment  services to 1,000
customers  in  North  Carolina  and  South  Carolina.  ISI  provides  predictive
maintenance services to water utility companies and other industrial  operations
in North Carolina, South Carolina,  Florida,  Georgia,  Tennessee,  Virginia and
Texas. ISI was acquired in 1996.
   Water and Wastewater Rates. 1995 Rate Case.  Florida Water requested an $18.1
million rate increase in June 1995. On Oct. 30, 1996,  the FPSC issued its final
order in the  Florida  Water rate case.  The final order  established  water and
wastewater  rates for all customers of Florida Water  regulated by the FPSC. The
new rates,  which became effective on Sept. 20, 1996,  resulted in an annualized
increase in revenue of approximately $11.1 million. This increase included,  and
was not in addition to, the $7.9 million increase in annualized  revenue granted
as interim  rates  effective  on Jan.  23,  1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate
structure  called  "capband,"  which replaces  uniform rates.  The new structure
combines the concept of a "cap" on monthly bills at a certain usage level for 85
of  Florida  Water's  facilities  that are more  expensive  to  operate,  with a
"banding,"  or  grouping,  of  rates  paid by  customers  served  by the 56 less
expensive  facilities.  On Nov.  1, 1996,  Florida  Water filed with the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  (Court) an appeal of the FPSC's  final  order
seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in
utility  
                                       -7-
<PAGE>
facilities   recoverable   in  rates  from   current   customers.   Motions  for
reconsideration  of the  FPSC's  final  order were  subsequently  filed by other
parties to the rate case.  Therefore,  the Court has postponed  Florida  Water's
appeal  pending the FPSC's  disposition  of the  reconsideration  requests.  The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this  matter.  Florida law  provides
that the new rates be implemented while the order is under appeal.
   1991 Rate Case Refund Order.  Responding to a Florida  Supreme Court decision
addressing the issue of retroactive  ratemaking with respect to another company,
in March 1996 the FPSC voted to reconsider an October 1995 order (Refund  Order)
which would have  required  Florida  Water to refund  about $13  million,  which
includes  interest,  to customers who paid more since October 1993 under uniform
rates than they would have paid under stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order,
the  collection  of the $13 million from  customers  who paid less under uniform
rates would not be  permitted.  The Refund  Order was in response to the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  reversal in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order
which  imposed  uniform  rates  for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in
Florida.  With "uniform  rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the
same rates for water and wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative
to "stand-alone" rates which are based on the cost of serving each service area.
The FPSC reconsidered the Refund Order, but upheld its decision to order refunds
in August 1996.  Florida  Water filed an appeal of this  decision with the First
District  Court of  Appeals.  A decision on the appeal is  anticipated  by early
1998. The Company continues to believe that it would be improper for the FPSC to
order a refund  to one  group of  customers  without  permitting  recovery  of a
similar  amount from the remaining  customers  since the First District Court of
Appeals  affirmed the Company's  total  revenue  requirement  for  operations in
Florida.  No provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.
   Florida Jurisdictional Issues. In June 1995 the FPSC issued an order assuming
jurisdiction over Florida Water facilities  statewide following an investigation
of all of Florida Water's facilities.  Several counties in Florida appealed this
FPSC decision to the First District Court of Appeals. In December 1996 the Court
issued an opinion  reversing  the FPSC order.  In December 1996 the FPSC filed a
motion for clarification and for rehearing with the Court. The Court denied this
motion in January 1997. The FPSC voted to require  Florida Water to charge rates
to customers in Hernando County based on a modified  stand-alone  rate structure
in January 1997.  The  imposition of this rate  structure  would reduce  Florida
Water  revenue by $1.6 million on a prospective  annual basis.  No order has yet
been issued reflecting this vote. Florida Water is considering an appeal of such
an order. In the event county regulation of water and wastewater rates prevails,
the Company  anticipates that the regulatory  process will become  significantly
more complex and expensive.
   Competition. Water services provide water and wastewater utility services at 
regulated rates within exclusive service territories granted by regulators.
   1996 and 1995  Comparison.  Operating  revenue and income from water services
increased 29% in 1996  compared to 1995.  Rate relief and a 9% increase in sales
in 1996 are  primarily  responsible  for the  increase.  The  addition of 17,000
customers  following  the December 1995  purchase of Orange  Osceola  offset the
15,000  customer  decrease  from the sale of Venice  Gardens in 1994.  Workforce
reductions and ongoing cost controls  contributed to 1996 results.  The addition
of ISI operations in 1996 increased revenue and expense about 6%.  Approximately
$1.7  million in pre-tax  gains  were added to 1996  results  due to the sale of
assets in South Carolina.
   Water services  contributed 18 cents per share to earnings in 1996,  compared
to a 4 cent loss in 1995. The Company  anticipates  continued growth in earnings
from this segment as Heater  aggressively  pursues  opportunities  to expand its
business  in North  Carolina,  additional  competitive  operations  are added to
complement ISI and cost controls combined with efficiency gains are continued in
ongoing operations. The outcome of Florida's rate case and jurisdictional issues
have the potential for affecting the profitability of this segment.
   1995 and 1994  Comparison.  Operating  revenue and income from water services
fell 24% in 1995  compared to 1994.  The decrease is  attributed to 15,000 fewer
customers  following  the sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets in December  1994 and
lower water  consumption  due to high  rainfall in parts of Florida and customer
conservation  efforts.  The sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets  contributed  $19.1
million to water services' operating revenue in 1994.

Automotive Services

   Automotive  services  include  ADESA's  auction  facilities,  AFC, which is a
finance  company,  and an  auto  transport  company.  ADESA  is a  wholly  owned
subsidiary of the Company and is the third largest  automobile  auction business
in the US.  Headquartered in Indianapolis,  Indiana,  ADESA owns and operates 24
automobile  auctions  in the US and  Canada  through  which  used cars and other
vehicles  are  sold to  franchised  automobile  dealers  and  licensed  used car
dealers.   Sellers  at  ADESA's  auctions  include  domestic  and  foreign  auto
manufacturers,  car dealers, fleet/lease companies, banks and finance companies.
AFC provides inventory financing for wholesale and retail automobile dealers who
purchase vehicles from independent auctions as well as auction chains.

                                       -8-
<PAGE>
   The Company  acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995.  On Jan.  31,  1996,  the
Company provided  additional  capital in exchange for an additional 3% of ADESA.
On Aug. 21, 1996, the Company  acquired the remaining 17% ownership  interest of
ADESA from the ADESA management shareholders.
   During  1996  ADESA  opened  new  auto   auctions  in  Newark,   New  Jersey,
Jacksonville,  Florida and Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. During 1996 in Texas,
the third largest used car market in the US, ADESA acquired  auction  businesses
in Houston, San Antonio and Dallas, which together with its existing Austin site
are intended to firmly establish  ADESA's  presence in the Texas market.  During
1996  ADESA  also  acquired  auction   businesses  in  Portage,   Wisconsin  and
Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania.  In February 1997 ADESA  consolidated a small auction
facility in Concord, Massachusetts with its Boston facilities.
   AFC's floorplan  financing  operations have expanded in 1996. Located at most
ADESA  auction  locations,  AFC has  opened  loan  production  offices  at seven
independently owned  auto  auctions.  AFC expects to continue this  expansion in
1997.
   Competition.  Within the automobile  auction  industry,  ADESA's  competition
includes  independently  owned auctions as well as major chains and associations
with  auctions  within  its  geographic  proximity.  ADESA  competes  with other
auctions for dealers,  financial  institutions,  fleet and lease companies,  and
other sellers to provide  automobiles  for auction at consignment  sales and for
the supply of rental repurchase  vehicles from the automobile  manufacturers for
auction at factory  sales.  The  automobile  manufacturers  often choose between
auctions across  multi-state areas in distributing  rental repurchase  vehicles.
ADESA  competes  for sellers of  automobiles  by  attempting  to attract a large
number of dealers to purchase  vehicles,  which ensures  competitive  prices and
supports  the volume of  vehicles  auctioned,  and by  providing a full range of
services  including   reconditioning  services  which  prepare  automobiles  for
auction,  transporting  automobiles  to auction  and the prompt  handling of the
paperwork  necessary  to  complete  the  sales.  Another  factor  affecting  the
industry,  the impact of which is yet to be  determined,  is the entrance of the
"superstore", large used car dealerships, that have emerged in densely populated
markets.
   AFC is well positioned as a provider of floorplan  financing  services to the
used vehicle industry.  AFC's competition  includes other specialty lenders,  as
well as  banks  and  other  financial  institutions.  AFC  competes  with  other
floorplan  providers and strives to  distinguish  itself based upon ease of use,
quality  of service  and  price.  A key  component  of AFC's  program is on-site
personnel to assist automobile dealers with their financing needs.
   Auto auction  sales for the industry are predicted to rise at a rate of 6% to
8% annually.  With the increased  popularity of leasing and the high cost of new
cars,  the same cars may come to  auction  more than once.  Automotive  services
expect to participate in the industry's  growth through  selective  acquisitions
and expanded services.
   1996 and 1995 Comparison.  Automotive services contributed 13 cents per share
to  corporate  earnings in 1996  compared to a  breakeven  performance  in 1995.
Severe winter  weather on the east coast limited  auction sales in January 1996.
However, operating revenue was strong in 1996 as a result of the eight new sites
and increased ancillary services.  AFC expanded its dealer financing business in
1996 increasing  financing income and earnings.  Start-up losses associated with
the new sites in New Jersey and Florida had a negative  impact on  profitability
of this segment through 1996. For the six months ended Dec. 31, 1995,  operating
revenue was $61.6 million with no net income contribution.  Financial results in
1995 were  adversely  impacted by auction  cancellations  due to severe  weather
conditions  on the east  coast in  December  1995,  as well as  start-up  losses
associated with major construction projects.  Growth in AFC's financing business
and  growth  in the  number  of cars  being  auctioned  combined  with  improved
efficiencies and significant cost controls at existing  auctions are expected to
increase the contributions to earnings in 1997.  Financial results for ADESA for
periods  prior  to July 1,  1995,  are not  comparable  due to  several  factors
including the amortization of goodwill,  the severe weather in December 1995 and
January 1996, and the addition of eight auction facilities which caused ADESA to
incur additional financing expenses and significant start-up costs.

Investments

   Investments  include a portfolio of  securities  managed by  Minnesota  Power
which  provides  earnings  and cash  flow  contributions  and is  available  for
reinvestment in existing businesses and acquisitions. Investments also include a
21% equity investment in Capital Re, a financial guaranty  reinsurance  company,
and an 80% interest in Lehigh, a Florida real estate company.
   Portfolio and Reinsurance. As of Dec. 31, 1996, the Company had approximately
$155 million invested in a securities  portfolio.  The majority of the portfolio
consists of stocks of other utility  companies that have  investment  grade debt
securities  outstanding  and are  considered  by the Company to be  conservative
investments.  Additionally,  

                                       -9-
<PAGE>
the Company sells common stock  securities  short and enters into short sales of
treasury  futures  contracts as part of an overall  investment  portfolio  hedge
strategy.  The  Company  plans to  continue  to  concentrate  in market  neutral
strategies  that are designed to provide stable and acceptable  returns  without
sacrificing  needed liquidity.  Returns will continue to be partially  dependent
upon general market yields.
   Capital  Re is  the  parent  company  of a  group  of  specialty  reinsurance
companies. The Company's equity investment in Capital Re continues to be a major
contributor to earnings. In 1996 Capital Re contributed $7.8 million to earnings
compared to $8.2 million in 1995 and $7 million in 1994. The market value of the
Company's  $102  million  investment  in Capital Re was $152 million at Dec. 31,
1996.
   1996 and 1995 Comparison.  The Company's  securities portfolio performed well
in 1996.  The  securities  portfolio and investment in Capital Re contributed 80
cents to  earnings  per  share  compared  to 88 cents  in  1995.  Portfolio  and
reinsurance earned an after-tax return of 8.8% in 1996 and 9.2% in 1995.
   1995 and 1994 Comparison. In 1995 the performance of the securities portfolio
improved  significantly  over 1994.  Earnings per share from the  portfolio  and
reinsurance  were 88 cents per share compared to 47 cents in 1994. The write-off
of a $10.1 million securities investment lowered earnings in 1994. Portfolio and
reinsurance earned an after-tax return of 9.2% in 1995 and 3.8% in 1994.
   Real Estate Operations. The Company owns 80% of Lehigh, a real estate company
which owns various real estate  properties  in Florida.  Lehigh  currently  owns
4,000 acres of land and approximately 8,000 home sites near Fort Myers, Florida,
1,250  home  sites in Citrus  County,  Florida,  and 3,000 home sites and 13,000
acres of commercial land at Palm Coast,  Florida.  The Palm Coast properties and
$18 million  receivable  portfolio were purchased in April 1996. The real estate
strategy is to acquire large residential  community  properties at low cost, add
value, and sell them at going market prices.
   Tax Benefits.  The Company,  through  Lehigh,  a 67% owned  subsidiary at the
time,  acquired the stock of Lehigh  Corporation in a bargain  purchase in 1991.
Lehigh  then  began  execution  of a  business  strategy  pursuant  to which the
majority of the  acquired  real estate  assets  would be disposed of over a five
year period. An additional interest in Lehigh was purchased in 1993 bringing the
Company's ownership interest to 80%. The structure of the transactions  involved
the acquisition of stock so the tax bases of the underlying acquired assets were
carried over for income tax purposes.  The  carried-over  tax bases exceeded the
book bases  assigned in purchase  accounting.  The  Internal  Revenue Code (IRC)
limits the use of tax losses  resulting  from the higher tax basis over the fair
market  value of the  underlying  assets  for a period of five  years.  The 1993
increase in ownership by the Company to 80%,  which resulted in the inclusion of
Lehigh and Lehigh Corporation in the Company's  consolidated tax return, started
another five year limitation period.
   SFAS 109 was adopted on a  prospective  basis  effective  Jan. 1, 1993.  Upon
adoption,  a valuation  reserve was established for the entire amount of the tax
benefits  attributable  to the bases  differences  and  alternative  minimum tax
credits because, in management's  judgment,  realization of the tax benefits was
not "more  likely  than not." This  judgment  was based on the  unlikelihood  of
realizing the tax benefits due to the IRC restrictions, in light of management's
existing five year property  disposal  plan.  This situation  continued  through
1994.
   In 1995 Lehigh  implemented  a business  strategy  which called for Lehigh to
dispose  of its  remaining  real  estate  assets  with a specific  view  towards
maximizing  realization of the tax benefits.  The new strategy was adopted after
the Board of Directors of Lehigh,  including  the  minority  shareholders,  were
convinced of the cash flow benefit to Lehigh of deferring the liquidation of the
remaining real estate  assets.  Accordingly,  in 1995 the valuation  reserve was
reduced by $18.4  million based on a detailed  analysis of the projected  future
taxable income based on the new business strategy.
   In 1996 the remaining  $8.2 million  valuation  reserve was reversed based on
the  projected  positive  impact the  acquisition  of $34 million of real estate
assets at Palm  Coast  would have on  Lehigh's  taxable  income.  The Palm Coast
assets were not considered in the 1995 revised strategy.
   1996 and 1995 Comparison.  Revenue in 1996 includes  increased sales from the
Palm Coast  properties  and $3.7 million from the sale of Lehigh's joint venture
in a resort and golf course.  Lehigh also  recognized  $8.2 and $18.4 million of
tax benefits in 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  The Company's  portion of the tax
benefits  reflected as net income was $6.6 million in 1996 and $14.7  million in
1995.  Real  estate  operations  added 50 cents to  earnings  per  share in 1996
compared to 58 cents in 1995,  of which tax benefits  were 22 cents and 52 cents
in 1996 and 1995, respectively.
   1995 and 1994  Comparison.  Income from real estate  operations was higher in
1995  than  1994  primarily  due to the  recognition  of  $18.4  million  of tax
benefits.  This tax benefit was partially  offset by fewer commercial land sales
and less interest income from Lehigh's maturing accounts receivable portfolio.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   As  detailed in the  consolidated  statement  of cash flows,  cash flows from
operating  activities  were  affected by a number of factors  representative  of
normal  operations.  Automotive  services are  included  since the July 1, 1995,
acquisition of ADESA.
   Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally is provided by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and approximately 5.4 million original issue shares of common stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.  Minnesota Power's $77 million bank
lines of credit provide  liquidity for the Company's  commercial  paper program.
The amount and timing of future sales of the  Company's  securities  will depend
upon market  conditions and the specific  needs of the Company.  The Company may
from time to time sell securities to meet capital  requirements,  to provide for
the retirement or early  redemption of issues of long-term debt and/or preferred
stock, to reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.
   A substantial amount of ADESA's working capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA utilizes borrowings from the
Company to meet short-term working capital  requirements arising from the timing
of payment  obligations to vehicle  sellers and the  availability  of funds from
vehicle  purchasers.  During the sales  process,  ADESA does not typically  take
title to vehicles.
   AFC  also  offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for  dealers  to  purchase
automobiles   at  auctions  in  exchange  for  a  security   interest  in  those
automobiles.  The  financing  is  provided  through  the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the  automobile or a general  borrowing  term of 30 - 60 days. As a
result,  AFC also  uses  borrowings  from the  Company  to meet its  operational
requirements. During 1996 AFC increased the financing program for dealers and in
December sold a $50 million  participation in its finance receivables to a third
party  purchaser.  Under  the terms of the five year  agreement,  the  purchaser
agrees  to make  reinvestments  up to  $100  million  to the  extent  that  such
reinvestments  are  supported by eligible  receivables.  On Dec.  31, 1996,  AFC
received $50 million from the sale of receivables and used the proceeds to repay
borrowings from the Company.
   In January  1996  Florida  Water  issued  $35.1  million  of 6.5%  Industrial
Development  Refunding  Revenue Bonds Series 1996 due Oct. 1, 2025. The proceeds
were used to refund existing industrial development revenue bonds totaling $33.8
million.  Also in January 1996 the Company provided  additional capital to ADESA
in exchange for an additional 3% of ADESA.  In August 1996 the Company  acquired
the  remaining  17%  ownership  interest  of  ADESA  from the  ADESA  management
shareholders.  Funds from the issuance of commercial  paper were used to acquire
the remaining 17% of ADESA.
   MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned  business trust of
the Company for the purpose of issuing common and preferred securities. In March
1996 the Trust publicly issued three million 8.05%  Cumulative  Quarterly Income
Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred beneficial interests in the
assets held by the Trust, indirectly resulting in net proceeds to the Company of
$72.3 million. The net proceeds to the Company were used to retire approximately
$56 million of  commercial  paper and  approximately  $17  million  were used to
redeem all of the outstanding  shares of the Company's  Serial  Preferred Stock,
$7.36 Series, in May 1996.
   In May 1996 ADESA  issued $90 million of 7.70%  Senior  Notes,  Series A, Due
2006 in a Rule 144A  offering.  Proceeds  were  used by ADESA to repay  existing
indebtedness,   including   borrowings  under  ADESA's   revolving  bank  credit
agreement,  floating  rate option notes and certain  borrowings  from  Minnesota
Power.
   In June 1996 Lehigh obtained a $20 million  adjustable rate revolving line of
credit due in 2003. The proceeds were used to partially  finance the acquisition
of real estate near Palm Coast, Florida. In June 1996 the Company's registration
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  became effective with respect to 5
million  additional  shares of common  stock for offer and sale  pursuant to the
DRIP. Previously available to registered holders and electric utility customers,
the DRIP has been amended, effective July 2, 1996, to, among other things, allow
any  interested  investor  to enroll in the plan with an initial  investment  of
$250.
   In September 1996 Minnesota  Power  exchanged  473,006 shares of common stock
for all the outstanding  shares of common stock of Alamo Auto Auction,  Inc. and
Alamo Auto Auction Houston,  Inc. The common stock was issued by the Company and
delivered  to the  sellers  in a  private  placement  transaction  that has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests.
   In January  1997 the Company  filed a shelf  registration  to issue up to $80
million in principal amount of Minnesota Power First Mortgage Bonds. On Feb. 20,
1997, the Company sold $60 million of First Mortgage  Bonds,  7% Series due Feb.
15,  2007,  for net proceeds to the Company of $59.4  million.  The net proceeds
along  with  internally  generated  funds  were used for the  retirement  of $60
million in principal amount of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds, 7 3/8% Series
due March 1, 1997.

   Minnesota Power's electric utility first mortgage bonds and secured pollution
control  bonds are  currently  rated the following  investment  grades:  Baa1 by
Moody's  Investor  Services and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's.  The  disclosure of
these  security  ratings  is not a  recommendation  to buy,  sell  or  hold  the
Company's securities.
   In 1996 the Company paid out 90% of its per-share earnings in dividends. Over
the longer term,  Minnesota  Power's goal is to reduce dividend payout to 75% to
80% of earnings.  This is expected to be  accomplished  by  increasing  earnings
rather than reducing dividends.
   Capital Requirements.  Consolidated capital expenditures in 1996 totaled $101
million.  These expenditures  included $38 million for electric operations,  $22
million  for  water  services  and  $41  million  for  automobile  auction  site
relocation  and  development.  Internally  generated  funds and  long-term  bank
financing were used to fund these capital expenditures.
   Capital  expenditures  are expected to be $61 million in 1997 and total about
$260 million for 1998  through  2001.  The 1997 amount  includes $33 million for
electric  system  component  replacement  and  upgrades,  $21  million  to  meet
environmental  standards,  expand water and wastewater  treatment  facilities to
accommodate  customer growth,  and for water  conservation  initiatives,  and $7
million for on-going  improvements  at existing  automobile  auction sites.  The
Company  expects to use  internally  generated  funds and original  issue equity
securities to fund these capital expenditures.
   New Accounting  Standard.  In June 1996 the FASB issued SFAS 125, "Accounting
for  Transfers  and  Servicing  of  Financial  Assets  and   Extinguishments  of
Liabilities," effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 31, 1996. SFAS 125
provides  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  transfers and servicing of
financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities.  The standards are based on
consistent  application  of a  financial  components  approach  that  focuses on
control.  The adoption of SFAS 125 is expected to be immaterial to the Company's
financial position and results of operations.
   Safe Harbor  Statement.  In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), the Company is
hereby filing  cautionary  statements  identifying  important factors that could
cause the Company's actual results to differ  materially from those projected in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on behalf of the Company in this Annual Report, in presentations, in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates",   "estimates",   "expects",   "intends",   "plans",   "predicts",
"projects",  "will likely result", "will continue", and similar expressions) are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.
   Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions, and uncertainties
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:
(i) prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those of
the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the SCPSC and the PSCW,  with respect to
allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal
of assets and  facilities,  operation,  and  construction  of plant  facilities,
recovery of purchased  power,  and present or  prospective  wholesale and retail
competition  (including  but not  limited to retail  wheeling  and  transmission
costs);  (ii) economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
risks;  (iii) changes in and compliance with  environmental  and safety laws and
policies;  (iv) weather conditions;  (v) population growth rates and demographic
patterns; (vi) competition for retail and wholesale customers; (vii) pricing and
transportation of commodities; (viii) market demand, including structural market
changes;  (ix)  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of  inflation;  (x)
changes in project costs; (xi)  unanticipated  changes in operating expenses and
capital  expenditures;  (xii) capital market conditions;  (xiii) competition for
new  energy  development  opportunities;  and  (xiv)  legal  and  administrative
proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal)  and  settlements  that  influence the
business and profitability of the Company.
   Any  forward-looking  statement  speaks  only as of the  date on  which  such
statement  is made,  and the  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any
forward-looking  statement to reflect events or circumstances  after the date on
which such  statement  is made or to reflect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated
events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of each
such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Minnesota Power

   In our opinion,  the accompanying  consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated  statements  of  income,  of  retained  earnings  and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Minnesota
Power and its  subsidiaries  at December  31, 1996 and 1995,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December 31, 1996,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

Management

   The consolidated  financial  statements and other financial  information were
prepared  by  management,   which  is  responsible   for  their   integrity  and
objectivity.  The financial  statements  have been  prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles and necessarily  include some amounts
that are based on informed  judgments  and best  estimates  and  assumptions  of
management.
   To  meet  its  responsibilities   with  respect  to  financial   information,
management  maintains  and  enforces a system of  internal  accounting  controls
designed to provide assurance,  on a cost effective basis, that transactions are
carried out in accordance with management's  authorizations  and that assets are
safeguarded  against  loss from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The  system
includes an organizational  structure which provides an appropriate  segregation
of  responsibilities,  careful  selection  and  training of  personnel,  written
policies and procedures,  and periodic reviews by the internal audit department.
In addition,  the Company has a personnel policy which requires all employees to
maintain a high standard of ethical conduct.  Management  believes the system is
effective and provides  reasonable  assurance that all transactions are properly
recorded and have been executed in accordance with  management's  authorization.
Management  modifies and improves its system of internal  accounting controls in
response to changes in business  conditions.  The Company's internal audit staff
is charged  with the  responsibility  for  determining  compliance  with Company
procedures.
   Three directors of the Company, not members of management, serve as the Audit
Committee.  The  Board of  Directors,  through  its  Audit  Committee,  oversees
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets
regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants
to discuss  auditing and  financial  matters and to assure that each is carrying
out its responsibilities.  The internal auditors and the independent accountants
have full and free access to the Audit Committee without management present.
   Price  Waterhouse  LLP,  independent  accountants,  are engaged to express an
opinion on the financial statements. Their audit is conducted in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards and includes a review of internal controls
and tests  transactions  to the extent  necessary to allow them to report on the
fairness of the operating results and financial condition of the Company.

2  Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

   Financial  Statement  Preparation.  Minnesota  Power  prepares its  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
principles  require management to make informed judgments and best estimates and
assumptions that (1) affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  (2)
disclose  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of  the  financial
statements,  and (3) report amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
   Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial  statements include
the accounts of the Company and all of its majority owned subsidiary  companies.
All material  intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.
   Nature of Operations and Revenue Recognition. Minnesota Power is a 
diversified utility that has operations in four principal business segments.
   Electric  Operations.  Electric  service is provided to 135,000  customers in
northern  Minnesota and northwestern  Wisconsin.  Large power  customers,  which
include Minnesota's  taconite producers,  paper and wood products  manufacturers
and two pipeline companies,  purchase under contracts, which extend from October
1999 through December 2007, about half of the electricity the Company sells. BNI
Coal,  a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  mines and sells  lignite  coal to two North
Dakota mine-mouth  generating units, one of which is Square Butte.  Square Butte
supplies Minnesota Power with 71% of its output under a long-term contract. (See
Note 17.)
   Electric  rates are under  the  jurisdiction  of  various  state and  federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued  for  service  provided  but  not yet  billed.  Electric  rates  include
adjustment  clauses which bill or credit customers for fuel and purchased energy
costs above or below the base levels in rate schedules and bill retail customers
for the recovery of CIP expenditures not collected in base rates.
   During  1996,  1995 and 1994,  revenue  derived  from one major  customer was
$57.1, $60.4 and $60.2 million, respectively. Revenue derived from another major
customer was $41.2, $44.9 and $45.3 million, respectively.
   Water Services.  Florida Water,  formerly Southern States Utilities,  Inc., a
wholly owned  subsidiary,  is the largest  investor  owned supplier of water and
wastewater utility services in Florida. Heater, another wholly owned subsidiary,
provides  water and wastewater  services in North  Carolina and South  Carolina.
ISI, a wholly owned  subsidiary,  provides  predictive  maintenance  services to
water utility companies and other industrial operations in North Carolina, South
Carolina,  Florida,  Georgia,  Tennessee,  Virginia and Texas. In total, 142,000
water and 56,000 wastewater treatment customers are served. Water and wastewater
rates  are  under the  jurisdiction  of  various  state  and  county  regulatory
authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is accrued for
water sold but not billed.
   Automotive Services.  ADESA, a wholly owned subsidiary,  owns and operates 24
automobile  auctions in the US and  Canada.  ADESA acts as an agent in the sales
process, receiving fees from both buyers and sellers of automobiles.  During the
sales  process,  ADESA does not  generally  take title to  vehicles.  ADESA also
provides a wide range of related  services  such as auto  reconditioning,  title
processing  and  vehicle  transport.  Floorplan  financing  is  provided by AFC.
Revenue is recognized when services are performed.
   Investments.   The  Company's   securities   portfolio   provides  funds  for
reinvestment  and  business  acquisitions.  The Company has a 21%  ownership  in
Capital Re, a financial guaranty  reinsurance  company,  accounted for using the
equity method,  and an 80% ownership in Lehigh,  a Florida real estate business.
Real estate revenue is recognized on the accrual basis.
   Income  Taxes.  The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under  SFAS  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS 109 is an asset and liability  approach that
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax  consequences of temporary  differences  between the carrying amounts
and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities.
   Plant Depreciation. Plant is recorded at original cost. The cost of additions
to plant and  replacement  of  retirement  units of  property  are  capitalized.
Maintenance  costs and  replacements  of minor items of property  are charged to
expense as incurred.  Costs of depreciable units of plant retired are eliminated
from the plant  accounts.  Such costs plus  removal  expenses  less  salvage are
charged to  accumulated  depreciation  for utility  plant.  Plant  stated on the
balance sheet includes  construction  work in progress and is net of accumulated
depreciation.   Various   pollution   abatement   facilities   are  leased  from
municipalities  which have issued pollution control revenue bonds to finance the
cost  of the  facilities.  The  cost of the  facilities  and  the  related  debt
obligation,  which is guaranteed  by the Company,  has been recorded as electric
plant and long-term debt, respectively.
   Depreciation  of utility  plant is computed  using  rates based on  estimated
useful lives of the various classes of property.  Provisions for depreciation of
the average  original cost of depreciable  property  approximated  3.2% in 1996,
3.3% in 1995 and 3% in 1994.  Contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) relate
to water and wastewater plant  contributed to the Company by developers and cash
from customers.  CIAC is amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the estimated
life of the asset to which it relates  when placed in service.  Amortization  of
CIAC reduces depreciation expense.
   Fuel, Material and Supplies. Fuel, material and supplies are stated at the 
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.
   Goodwill.  Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  cost  over  net  assets  of
businesses  acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years.
The Company continually  evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred
indicating  that the  remaining  estimated  useful life of  goodwill  may not be
appropriate.  When  factors  indicate  that  goodwill  should be  evaluated  for
possible  impairment,  the Company  uses an estimate of the  acquired  business'
undiscounted  future cash flows  compared to the  carrying  value of goodwill to
determine if a write-off is necessary.

                                       -18-
<PAGE>

   Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. The Company's utility operations are
subject to the  provisions  of SFAS 71,  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation."  The Company  capitalizes as deferred  regulatory  charges
incurred costs which are probable of recovery in future utility rates.  Deferred
regulatory  credits  represent  amounts  expected to be credited to customers in
rates. (See Note 4.)
   Unamortized  Expense,  Discount  and Premium on Debt.  Expense,  discount and
premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.
   Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all investments purchased 
with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
   Foreign  Currency  Translation.  Results of  operations  for ADESA's  foreign
subsidiaries  are  translated  into US dollars using the average  exchange rates
during the period.  Assets and  liabilities are translated into US dollars using
the exchange rate at the balance sheet date,  except for  intangibles  and fixed
assets,  which  are  translated  at  historical  rates.   Resulting  translation
adjustments are recorded as cumulative  translation adjustment under the heading
Capitalization on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.


3  Acquisitions and Divestitures

   Acquisition of Palm Coast. In April 1996 Palm Coast Holdings,  Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Lehigh Acquisition Corporation,  acquired real estate assets
(Palm Coast) from ITT Community  Development  Corp. and other  affiliates of ITT
Industries,   Inc.  (ITT)  for  $34  million.  These  assets  include  developed
residential lots, a real estate contract receivables portfolio and approximately
13,000 acres of  commercial  and other land.  Palm Coast is a planned  community
located between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, Florida.
   ITT's wholly owned subsidiary,  Palm Coast Utility  Corporation  (PCUC),  has
granted an option to the Company  to acquire PCUC's water and wastewater utility
assets in Palm Coast. PCUC provides  services to approximately  12,000 customers
in  Flagler  County,  Florida.  If  the  option  is  exercised,  closing  of the
transaction will be subject to various regulatory approvals.
   Acquisition  of ISI.  In  April  1996 MP  Water  Resources  acquired  all the
outstanding  common  stock  of  Instrumentation  Services,  Inc.,  a  predictive
maintenance  service business,  in exchange for 96,526 shares of Minnesota Power
common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interest.  Prior
period financial results for 1996 have not been restated due to immateriality.
   Acquisition  of Orange  Osceola.  In December 1995 Florida Water acquired the
operating assets of Orange Osceola Utilities for approximately $13 million.  The
acquisition added over 17,000 water customers.
   Sale of Water Plant Assets. In March 1996 Heater of Seabrook,  Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Heater,  sold all of its water and wastewater utility assets
to the Town of Seabrook Island,  South Carolina for $5.9 million.  This sale was
negotiated in  anticipation  of an eminent domain action by the Town of Seabrook
Island,  South  Carolina.  In  December  1996 Heater  sold its  Columbia,  South
Carolina  area water systems to South  Carolina  Water and Sewer,  L.L.C.  Water
services on the  Company's  consolidated  statement of income  includes  pre-tax
gains of $1.7 million from these sales.
   In December 1994 Florida  Water sold all of the assets of its Venice  Gardens
water and  wastewater  utilities to Sarasota  County in Florida (the County) for
$37.6  million.  The  sale  increased  1994 net  income  by  $11.8  million  and
contributed 42 cents to 1994 earnings per share. Water services on the Company's
consolidated  statement of income  includes a pre-tax gain of $19.1 million from
the sale.  This sale was negotiated in  anticipation of an eminent domain action
by the County.
   Acquisition of ADESA.  The Company acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995, for
$167 million in cash. The Company  accounted for the  acquisition as a purchase.
Acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets associated with this acquisition
are being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over  periods not  exceeding  40
years. In January 1996 the Company provided an additional $15 million of capital
in exchange for  1,982,346  original  issue  common stock shares of ADESA.  This
capital contribution increased the Company's ownership interest in ADESA to 83%.
In August 1996 the Company  acquired the  remaining  17%  ownership  interest of
ADESA from the ADESA management  shareholders.  Financial results for ADESA have
been included in the Company's  consolidated  financial statements as of July 1,
1995.
   The following summary presents unaudited pro forma consolidated results as if
the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in ADESA on Jan. 1, 1995. The pro
forma  results  are not  necessarily  indicative  of what  actually  would  have
occurred if the  acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of 1995, nor
are they necessarily  indicative of future consolidated  results.  The pro forma
results should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial
statements and related notes of Minnesota Power.

   In September  1996  Minnesota  Power  exchanged  473,006 shares of its common
stock for all the outstanding common stock of Alamo Auto Auction, Inc. and Alamo
Auto Auction Houston,  Inc. These  acquisitions were accounted for as pooling of
interests. Prior period financial results for 1996 have not been restated due to
immateriality.  Three other  auction  facilities  were also acquired in 1996 and
were accounted for using the purchase  method.  Pro forma  consolidated  results
reflecting these purchases have not been presented due to immateriality.

   Discontinued Operations.  On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its interest
in the paper and pulp  business  to  Consolidated  Papers,  Inc.  (CPI) for $118
million in cash,  plus CPI's  assumption of certain debt and lease  obligations.
The Company is still committed to a maximum  guaranty of $95 million to ensure a
portion of a $33.4  million  annual lease  obligation  for paper mill  equipment
under an  operating  lease  extending to 2012.  CPI has agreed to indemnify  the
Company  for any  payments  the  Company  may make as a result of the  Company's
obligation  relating to this operating lease. The financial results of the paper
and pulp business, including the loss on disposition, have been accounted for as
discontinued operations.

   Exit from  Equipment  Manufacturing  Business.  In June 1995 Reach All ceased
operations  and sold its operating  assets.  Pre-tax  losses from Reach All were
$6.4 million in 1995 and $5.2 million in 1994.

4  Regulatory Matters

   The Company  files for periodic  rate  revisions  with the  Minnesota  Public
Utilities  Commission (MPUC),  the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC),
the  Florida  Public  Service  Commission  (FPSC)  and other  state  and  county
regulatory authorities. The MPUC had regulatory authority over approximately 69%
in 1996, 73% in 1995 and 75% in 1994 of the Company's  total electric  operating
revenue.  Interim rates in Minnesota and Florida are placed into effect, subject
to refund with interest, pending a final decision by the appropriate commission.
   Electric Rate  Proceedings.  The Company's most recent  Minnesota retail case
was filed Jan. 3, 1994.  Interim rates were in effect from March 1, 1994,  until
final rates became  effective on June 1, 1995. The MPUC approved an 11.6% return
on common equity and an overall  increase in annual revenue of $19 million.  The
MPUC also approved revenue neutral rate adjustments which increased  residential
rates 3.5% on Jan. 1, 1996 and 3.5% on Jan. 1, 1997. The  residential  increases
were offset by lower large power demand charge rates.
   The MPUC also allows the  Company to collect  the cost of fuel  burned  (over
what is already included in the base rate) and the expenditures and lost margins
related to conservation  improvement  programs  (CIP).  These expenses are being
collected  through an adjustment on the customers'  bills known as the "resource
adjustment."
   Water and Wastewater Rates. 1995 Rate Case.  Florida Water requested an $18.1
million rate increase in June 1995. On Oct. 30, 1996,  the FPSC issued its final
order in the  Florida  Water rate case.  The final order  established  water and
wastewater  rates for all customers of Florida Water  regulated by the FPSC. The
new rates,  which became effective on Sept. 20, 1996,  resulted in an annualized
increase in revenue of approximately $11.1 million. This increase included,  and
was not in addition to, the $7.9 million increase in annualized  revenue granted
as interim  rates  effective  on Jan.  23,  1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate
structure  called  "capband,"  which replaces  uniform rates.  The new structure
combines the concept of a "cap" on monthly bills at a certain usage level for 85
of  Florida  Water's  facilities  that are more  expensive  to  operate,  with a
"banding,"  or  grouping,  of  rates  paid by  customers  served  by the 56 less
expensive  facilities.  On Nov.  1, 1996,  Florida  Water filed with the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  (Court) an appeal of the FPSC's  final  order
seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in
utility  facilities  recoverable  in rates from current  customers.  Motions for
reconsideration  of the  FPSC's  final  order were  subsequently  filed by other
parties to the rate case.  Therefore,  the Court has postponed  Florida  Water's
appeal  pending the FPSC's  disposition  of the  reconsideration  requests.  The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this  matter.  Florida law  provides
that the new rates be implemented while the order is under appeal.
   1991 Rate Case Refund Order.  Responding to a Florida  Supreme Court decision
addressing the issue of retroactive  ratemaking with respect to another company,
in March 1996 the FPSC voted to reconsider an October 1995 order (Refund  Order)
which would have  required  Florida  Water to refund  about $13  million,  which
includes  interest,  to customers who paid more since October 1993 under uniform
rates than they would have paid under stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order,
the  collection  of the $13 million from  customers  who paid less under uniform
rates would not be  permitted.  The Refund  Order was in response to the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  reversal in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order
which  imposed  uniform  rates  for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in
Florida.  With "uniform  rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the
same rates for water and wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative
to "stand-alone" rates which are based on the cost of serving each service area.
The FPSC reconsidered the Refund Order, but upheld its decision to order refunds
in August 1996.  Florida  Water filed an appeal of this  decision with the First
District  Court of  Appeals.  A decision on the appeal is  anticipated  by early
1998. The Company continues to believe that it would be improper for the FPSC to
order a refund  to one  group of  customers  without  permitting  recovery  of a
similar  amount from the remaining  customers  since the First District Court of
Appeals  affirmed the Company's  total  revenue  requirement  for  operations in
Florida.

                                       -20-
<PAGE>
No provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.
   Florida Jurisdictional Issues. In June 1995 the FPSC issued an order assuming
jurisdiction over Florida Water facilities  statewide following an investigation
of all of Florida Water's facilities.  Several counties in Florida appealed this
FPSC decision to the First District Court of Appeals. In December 1996 the Court
issued an opinion  reversing the FPSC order.  In December 1996, the FPSC filed a
motion for clarification and for rehearing with the Court. The Court denied this
motion in January 1997. The FPSC voted in January 1997 to require  Florida Water
to charge rates to customers in Hernando County based on a modified  stand-alone
rate structure. The imposition of this rate structure would reduce Florida Water
revenue by $1.6 million on a  prospective  annual  basis.  No order has yet been
issued  reflecting this vote.  Florida Water is considering an appeal of such an
order.  In the event county  regulation of water and wastewater  rates prevails,
the Company  anticipates that the regulatory  process will become  significantly
more complex and expensive.
   Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. Based on current rate treatment, the
Company believes all deferred regulatory charges are probable of recovery.

5  Financial Instruments

   Securities Investments.  The majority of the Company's securities investments
are  primarily  stocks of other utility  companies  with  investment  grade debt
securities  outstanding  and are  considered  by the Company to be  conservative
investments.  The Company also has investments in four limited partnerships that
invest in equity and debt securities.
   Investments in equity and debt securities are classified in two categories on
the balance sheet:  Trading securities are those bought and held principally for
near-term sale. They are recorded at fair value as part of current assets,  with
changes in fair value during the period included in earnings. Available-for-sale
securities,  which are held for an  indefinite  period of time,  are recorded at
fair value in investments.  Changes in fair value during the period are recorded
net of tax as a separate  component of common stock equity. If the fair value of
any  available-for-sale  securities  declines  below  cost  and the  decline  is
considered  other than temporary,  the securities are written down to fair value
and the losses  charged to earnings.  Realized  gains and losses are computed on
each specific investment sold.

   Off-Balance-Sheet  Risks. In portfolio  strategies  designed to reduce market
risks,  the Company  sells common stock  securities  short and enters into short
sales of treasury futures contracts.
   Selling  common  stock  securities  short is intended to reduce  market price
risks associated with holding common stock  securities in the Company's  trading
securities portfolio.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses from short sales
of common stock securities are included in investment income.
   Treasury  futures  are used as a cross  hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks
associated  with  holding  fixed  dividend  preferred  stocks  included  in  the
Company's  available-for-sale  portfolio.  Changes in market  values of treasury
futures are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the underlying
hedged item. Gains and losses on treasury futures are deferred and recognized in
investment income concurrently with gains and losses arising from the underlying
hedged item. Generally,  treasury futures contracts entered into have a maturity
date of 90 days.
   As a consequence of refunding  industrial revenue bonds, in July 1996 Florida
Water entered into a five-year  interest rate

                                       -21-

<PAGE>

swap agreement to exchange fixed for floating  interest  rates,  which are reset
quarterly,  over the life of the swap  agreement  without  the  exchange  of the
underlying  notional  amounts  totaling $30 million.  The interest  rate swap is
subject to market  risk due to  fluctuation  of interest  rates.
   Under the swap agreement, Florida Water is required to make quarterly
interest payments to the counterparty  at a  variable  rate  based  upon a
weighted  average  of the PSA Municipal Swap Index (4.11% at Dec. 31, 1996),
while the counterpart is required to make  quarterly  interest  payments to
Florida  Water at an annual fixed rate (4.79% at Dec. 31, 1996).
   The notional amounts summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged and
are not a measure of the Company's financial exposure. The amounts  exchanged
are  calculated on the basis of these  notional  amounts and other terms which
relate to the change in interest rates and securities  prices. The Company
continually  evaluates the credit  standing of  counterparties  and market
conditions with respect to its off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments. The
Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations or
any material  adverse impact to its financial  position from these  financial
instruments.

   Fair Value of Financial  Instruments.  The  carrying  amount of cash and cash
equivalents,  trading securities, notes and other accounts receivable, and notes
payable  approximates  fair  value  because  of  the  short  maturity  of  those
instruments.  The Company records its trading and available-for-sale  securities
at fair  value  based on quoted  market  prices.  The fair  values for all other
financial instruments were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues.

   Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial  instruments that subject the Company
to   concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  trade  and  other
receivables.  The Company  sells  electricity  to about 14 customers in northern
Minnesota's taconite,  and paper and wood products industries.  At Dec. 31, 1996
and 1995,  receivables from these customers  totaled $6.9 and $7.6 million.  The

   Shareholder  Rights  Plan.  On July 24,  1996,  the Board of Directors of the
Company  adopted a rights  plan  (Rights  Plan)  pursuant to which it declared a
dividend  distribution  of one preferred  share  purchase right (Right) for each
outstanding  share of  common  stock to  shareholders  of record at the close of
business on July 24, 1996,  (the Record Date) and authorized the issuance of one
Right  with  respect  to each share of common  stock  that  becomes  outstanding
between the Record Date and July 23,  2006,  or such  earlier time as the Rights
are redeemed.
   Each Right will be  exercisable to purchase one  one-hundredth  of a share of
Junior Serial Preferred Stock A, without par value, at an exercise price of $90,
subject to adjustment,  following a distribution date which shall be the earlier
to occur of (i) 10 days following a public  announcement  that a person or group
(Acquiring  Person) has acquired,  or obtained the right to acquire,  beneficial
ownership  of 15% or more of the  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock  (Stock
Acquisition  Date)  or (ii) 15  business  days  (or  such  later  date as may be
determined by the Board of Directors  prior to the time that any person  becomes
an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or a public  announcement of
an intention to make, a tender or exchange offer if, upon consummation  thereof,
such person would meet the 15% threshold.
   Subject to certain exempt  transactions,  in the event that the 15% threshold
is met, each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring Person) will thereafter
have the right to receive,  upon exercise at the then current  exercise price of
the Right, common stock (or, in certain  circumstances,  cash, property or other
securities of the Company)  having a value equal to two times the exercise price
of the Right. If, at any time following the Stock  Acquisition Date, the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more
of the Company's  assets or earning power are sold,  each Right will entitle the
holder (other than the Acquiring  Person) to receive,  upon exercise at the then
current exercise price of the Right,  common stock of the acquiring or surviving
company  having a value  equal to two times  the  exercise  price of the  Right.
Certain stock acquisitions will also trigger a provision permitting the Board of
Directors to exchange each Right for one share of common stock.
   The Rights are nonvoting and expire on July 23, 2006,  unless redeemed by the
Company  at a price  of $.01 per  Right  at any time  prior to the time a person
becomes  an  Acquiring  Person.  The  Board  of  Directors  has  authorized  the
reservation  of one  million  shares  of  Junior  Serial  Preferred  Stock A for
issuance under the Rights Plan in the event of exercise of the Rights.

13  Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of MP&L Capital I

   MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned  business trust of
the Company for the purpose of issuing  common and preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  On March 20, 1996, the Trust  publicly  issued three million 8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial  interests in the assets held by the Trust.  The proceeds of the sale
of the QUIPS, and of common securities of the Trust to the Company, were used by
the  Trust  to  purchase   from  the  Company  $77.5  million  of  8.05%  Junior
Subordinated Debentures, Series A, Due 2015 (Subordinated Debentures), resulting
in net  proceeds  to the  Company  of $72.3  million.  Holders  of the QUIPS are
entitled to receive  quarterly  distributions  at an annual rate of 8.05% of the
liquidation  preference value of $25 per security.  The Company has the right to
defer interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures which would result in the
similar deferral of distributions on the QUIPS during extension periods of up to
20 consecutive quarters, provided that no single distribution payment period, as
extended, may exceed 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods or extend
beyond the maturity of the Junior  Subordinated  Debentures.  The Company is the
owner of all the common trust securities,  which constitute  approximately 3% of
the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust Securities.  The sole asset of
the Trust is the Subordinated Debentures, interest on which is deductible by the
Company for income tax purposes.  The Trust will use interest  payments received
on the Subordinated Debentures it holds to make the quarterly cash distributions
on the QUIPS.
   The  QUIPS  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  upon  repayment  of  the
Subordinated  Debentures  at  maturity or upon  redemption.  The Company has the
option  at any time on or after  March 20,  2001,  to  redeem  the  Subordinated
Debentures,  in whole or in part.  The  Company  also has the  option,  upon the
occurrence  of  certain  events,  (i) to  redeem  at any time  the  Subordinated
Debentures,  in whole but not in part,  which would result in the  redemption of
all the Trust Securities,  or (ii) to terminate the Trust and cause the pro rata
distribution  of the  Subordinated  Debentures  to  the  holders  of  the  Trust
Securities.

   Tax Benefits.  The Company,  through  Lehigh,  a 67% owned  subsidiary at the
time,  acquired the stock of Lehigh  Corporation in a bargain  purchase in 1991.
Lehigh  then  began  execution  of a  business  strategy  pursuant  to which the
majority of the  acquired  real estate  assets  would be disposed of over a five
year period. An additional interest in Lehigh was purchased in 1993 bringing the
Company's ownership interest to 80%. The structure of the transactions  involved
the acquisition of stock so the tax bases of the underlying acquired assets were
carried over for income tax purposes.  The  carried-over  tax bases exceeded the
book bases  assigned in purchase  accounting.  The  Internal  Revenue Code (IRC)
limits the use of tax losses  resulting  from the higher tax basis over the fair
market  value of the  underlying  assets  for a period of five  years.  The 1993
increase in ownership by the Company to 80%,  which resulted in the inclusion of
Lehigh and Lehigh Corporation in the Company's  consolidated tax return, started
another five year limitation period.
   SFAS 109 was adopted on a  prospective  basis  effective  Jan. 1, 1993.  Upon
adoption,  a valuation  reserve was established for the entire amount of the tax
benefits  attributable  to the bases  differences  and  alternative  minimum tax
credits because, in management's  judgment,  realization of the tax benefits was
not "more  likely  than not." This  judgment  was based on the  unlikelihood  of
realizing the tax benefits due to the IRC restrictions, in light of management's
existing five year property  disposal  plan.  This situation  continued  through
1994.
   In 1995 Lehigh  implemented  a business  strategy  which called for Lehigh to
dispose  of its  remaining  real  estate  assets  with a specific  view  towards
maximizing  realization of the tax benefits.  The new strategy was adopted after
the Board of Directors of Lehigh,  including  the  minority  shareholders,  were
convinced of the cash flow benefit to Lehigh of deferring the liquidation of the
remaining real estate  assets.  Accordingly,  in 1995 the valuation  reserve was
reduced by $18.4  million based on a detailed  analysis of the projected  future
taxable income based on the new business strategy.
   In 1996 the remaining  $8.2 million  valuation  reserve was reversed based on
the  projected  positive  impact the  acquisition  of $34 million of real estate
assets at Palm  Coast  would have on  Lehigh's  taxable  income.  The Palm Coast
assets were not considered in the 1995 revised strategy.
    No  provision  has  been  made  for  taxes  on  $19.1  million  of  pre-1993
undistributed  earnings of Capital  Re, an  investment  accounted  for under the
equity  method.  Those  earnings  have been and are  expected  to continue to be
reinvested.  The Company  estimates that $7.9 million of tax would be payable on
the pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re if the Company should sell its
investment.  The Company has recognized  the income tax impact on  undistributed
earnings of Capital Re earned since Jan. 1, 1993.

15  Pension Plans and Benefits

   The Company's Minnesota and Wisconsin utility operations have noncontributory
defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees.  Pension benefits for
employees in Minnesota  and  Wisconsin are fully vested after five years and are
based on years of service and the highest  average monthly  compensation  earned
during four  consecutive  years within the last 15 years of employment.  Company
policy is to fund accrued pension costs,  including amortization of past service
costs,  over 5 to 30 years. Part of the pension cost is capitalized as a cost of
plant construction. Benefits under the Company's noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan for Florida utility operations were frozen as of Dec. 31, 1996.

(VEBA)  trusts and an  irrevocable  grantor  trust.  The maximum tax  deductible
contributions  are made to the VEBAs.  The  remainder of the funds are placed in
the irrevocable grantor trust until the funds can be used to make tax deductible
contributions  to the VEBAs.  The funds in the irrevocable  grantor trust do not
qualify as plan  assets for  purposes  of SFAS 106  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

   For measurement purposes, it was assumed per capita health care benefit costs
would increase 10.25% in 1996 and that cost increases would thereafter  decrease
1% each  year  until  stabilizing  at 5.25% in  2002.  Accelerating  the rate of
assumed  health  care  cost  increases  by 1% each  year  would  raise  the 1996
transition  obligation by $3.2 million and service and interest costs by a total
of  $1.1  million.  The  weighted  average  discount  rate  used  in  estimating
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations was 7.75% in 1996 and 1995. The
expected  long-term  rate of return on plan  assets was 9% in 1996 and 8.75% for
1995.

16  Employee Stock and Incentive Plans

   Employee Stock  Ownership Plan. The Company has sponsored an ESOP since 1975,
amending it in 1989 and 1990 to establish  two leveraged  accounts.  The Company
accounts for the ESOP in  accordance  with the  American  Institute of Certified
Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position 93-6 (SOP 93-6).
   The 1989 leveraged  ESOP account covers all nonunion  Minnesota and Wisconsin
employees  who work more than 1,000 hours per year and have one year of service.
The  ESOP  used  the  proceeds  from a $16.5  million  15-year  loan at  9.125%,
guaranteed by the Company,  to purchase 633,489 shares of Minnesota Power common
stock on the open market in early 1990.  These  shares  fund  employee  benefits
totaling not less than 2% of the participants' salaries.
   The 1990 leveraged ESOP account covers Minnesota and Wisconsin  employees who
participated  in the  non-leveraged  ESOP plan prior to Aug.  4, 1989.  The ESOP
issued a $75  million  promissory  note at  10.25%  with a term not to exceed 25
years to the Company  (Employer Loan) as consideration for 2.8 million shares of
newly issued  Minnesota  Power common stock in November  1990.  These shares are
used to fund a  benefit  at least  equal  to the  value  of the  following:  (a)
dividends on shares held in participants' 1990 leveraged ESOP accounts which are
used to make loan payments, and (b) the tax savings generated from deducting all
dividends  paid on shares  currently  in the ESOP which were held by the plan on
Aug. 4, 1989.
   The  loans  will be  repaid  with  dividends  received  by the  ESOP and with
employer  contributions.  ESOP  shares  acquired  with the loans were  initially
pledged  as  collateral  for the  loans.  The  ESOP  shares  are  released  from
collateral  and  allocated  to  participants  based on the portion of total debt
service paid in the year.

   Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(ESPP).  At Dec. 31, 1996,  195,097  shares of common stock were held in reserve
for future issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP permits  eligible  employees to buy
up to $23,750  per year in Company  common  stock.  Purchases  are at 95% of the
stock's  closing market price on the first day of each month.  At Dec. 31, 1996,
449,195 shares had been issued under the ESPP.
   Stock Option and Award Plans.  In May 1996 Company  shareholders  approved an
Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan (the  Executive  Plan) and a
Director  Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the Director Plan),  both effective as
of Jan. 1, 1996.
   The Executive  Plan allows for the grant of up to an aggregate of 2.1 million
shares of common stock to key  employees  of the Company.  Such grants may be in
the form of stock options and other awards, including stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock,  performance units and performance shares. In January 1996 the
Company granted non-qualified stock options to purchase 118,708 shares of common
stock and granted 80,788  performance  shares.  Additionally,  24,000 restricted
shares of common  stock  were  granted,  with the  restriction  expiring  over a
four-year  period.  The  Director  Plan  provides for the grant of up to 150,000
shares of common stock to nonemployee directors of the Company.  Pursuant to the
Director Plan each  nonemployee  director  receives an annual grant of 725 stock
options and a biennial grant of performance  shares equal to $10,000 in value of
common stock on the date of grant.
   The  exercise  price for stock  options is equal to the  market  value of the
common stock on the date of a grant.  Stock  options may be exercised 50% on the
first  anniversary  date  of the  grant  and  the  remaining  50% on the  second
anniversary,  and expire on the tenth anniversary.  Grants of performance shares
are earned over  multi-year  time periods upon the  achievement  of  performance
objectives.
   The Company has elected to recognize  compensation  cost for its  stock-based
compensation  plans in accordance with Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No.
25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  Generally,  no  compensation
expense is recognized for stock options with exercise prices equal to the market
value of the underlying  shares of stock at the date of the grant.  Compensation
cost is recognized over the vesting periods for performance and restricted share
awards based on the market value of the underlying shares of stock.
   Pro  forma   amounts  of  net  income  and  earnings  per  share   reflecting
compensation  cost  determined  based on the fair  value at the grant  dates for
awards under these plans consistent with the method of SFAS 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation,"  have not been presented because the amounts are not
material.  The initial effects of applying SFAS 123 may not be representative of
the pro forma  effects on reported  net income and earnings per share for future
years if additional awards are granted.

17  Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

   Under the terms of a 30-year  contract with Square Butte that extends through
2007,   the  Company  is  purchasing  71%  of  the  output  from  a  mine-mouth,
lignite-fired  generating  plant  capable  of  generating  up to  470  MW.  This
generating unit (Project) is located near Center,  N.D.  Reductions to about 49%
of the output are  provided  for in the  contract  and,  at the option of Square
Butte,  could begin after a five-year advance notice to the Company and continue
for the remaining  economic life of the Project.  The Company has the option but
not the obligation to continue to purchase 49% of the output after 2007.
   The Project is leased to Square Butte through Dec. 31, 2007, by certain banks
and their  affiliates  which have  beneficial  ownership in the Project.  Square
Butte has  options  to renew the lease  after  2007 for  essentially  the entire
remaining economic life of the Project.
   The Company is  obligated  to pay Square  Butte all Square  Butte's  leasing,
operating  and debt service costs (less any amounts  collected  from the sale of
power or energy to others)  that  shall not have been paid by Square  Butte when
due.  These costs  include the price of lignite  coal  purchased by Square Butte
under a cost-plus contract with BNI Coal. The Company's cost of power and energy
purchased  from Square  Butte during  1996,  1995 and 1994 was $58.2,  $57.6 and
$55.4 million,  respectively.  The leasing costs of Square Butte included in the
cost of power  delivered to the Company totaled $19.1 million in 1996, and $19.3
million in 1995 and in 1994,  which included  approximately  $10.2,  $11 and $12
million,  respectively,  of interest expense. The annual fixed lease obligations
of the Company for Square Butte are $20.1  million from 1997  through  2001.  At
Dec. 31, 1996,  Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $207  million.  The
Company's  obligation is absolute and unconditional  whether or not any power is
actually delivered to the Company.
   The  Company's  payments to Square Butte for power and energy are approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.
   One principal reason the Company entered into the agreement with Square Butte
was to obtain a power supply for large  industrial  customers.  Present electric
service contracts with these customers require payment of minimum monthly demand
charges that cover a portion of the fixed costs  associated with having capacity
available  to serve  them.  These  contracts  minimize  the  negative  impact on
earnings that could result from significant  reductions in kilowatthour sales to
industrial  customers.  The initial  minimum  contract  term for the large power
customers  is 10  years,  with a  four-year  cancellation  notice  required  for
termination  of the  contract at or beyond the end of the tenth year.  Under the
terms of existing  contracts  as of Feb.  1, 1997,  the  Company  would  collect
approximately  $101.6,  $89.2, $80.3, $70.1 and $61.9 million under current rate
levels  for firm  power  during  the  years  1997,  1998,  1999,  2000 and 2001,
respectively,  even if no power or energy were supplied to these customers after
Dec. 31, 1996.  The minimum  contract  provisions  are expressed in megawatts of
demand,  and if rates  change,  the amounts the Company  would collect under the
contracts will change in proportion to the change in the demand rate.
