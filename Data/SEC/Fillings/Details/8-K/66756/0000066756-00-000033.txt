                    MINNESOTA POWER SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME
                    -----------------------------------------
                INCREASED 30 PERCENT, EXCLUDING ACE LIMITED GAIN
                ------------------------------------------------

Propelled by continued strong performance  across all business units,  MINNESOTA
POWER,  INC. (NYSE:  MPL) reported a 30 percent increase in operating net income
for the second quarter.  Operating  earnings per share also increased 30 percent
for the second quarter to 48 cents per share compared to 37 cents last year.

Excluding a one-time  transaction  relating to the  company's  investment in ACE
Limited  (described  below),  2000 second quarter operating net income was $33.8
million on quarterly  revenue of $327 million  versus $26.0 million of operating
net income on $279.2 million of revenue a year ago.

"I am pleased with the  quarter-over-quarter  increases  for all of our business
segments," said Edwin L. Russell,  chief executive  officer of Minnesota  Power.
"This steady  progress  reflects the growth in value of each business as well as
the company as a whole. We continue to demonstrate a successful  transition to a
multi-services company."

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES continued its double-digit growth with a 23 percent increase
in net income from the same quarter last year.  The number of vehicles  financed
increased  16  percent,  and the number of vehicles  sold was up 14 percent.  As
announced  in  June,   the  company   expects  to  complete  two  large  auction
acquisitions.  These  acquisitions  will  increase the number of cars sold by 60
percent in the near term with additional growth potential in the future.

Continued strong retail sales and reduced operating and maintenance  expenses in
ELECTRIC SERVICES and a growing customer base and increased consumption in WATER
SERVICES allowed each segment to increase net income eight percent over the same
quarter last year.

Bolstered by real estate sales,  the  INVESTMENTS  segment  income  increased to
$10.2 million for the quarter versus $6.4 million a year ago.

ACE LIMITED  TRANSACTION:  Minnesota  Power recorded a one-time gain of 44 cents
per share in the second  quarter of 2000  resulting from the sale of 4.7 million
shares of ACE Limited  stock.  Proceeds of $127 million were  redeployed  in the
Automotive  Services  business.  Total earnings per share for the quarter are 92
cents.
