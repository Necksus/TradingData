            ALLETE THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS ON TARGET; ANNUAL EARNINGS
            --------------------------------------------------------
                   GROWTH TARGET HIKED TO 12 PERCENT FOR 2001
                   ------------------------------------------

ALLETE (NYSE:  ALE) today reported third quarter earnings of 50 cents per share,
meeting  analysts'  expectations  and matching  last year's strong third quarter
results.

Third quarter net income was $35 million on quarterly  revenue of $323.5 million
compared to net income of $34.5 million on revenue of $308 million a year ago.

"We are on track to achieve our target of 10 percent annual  earnings growth for
2000,"  said Edwin L.  Russell,  chief  executive  officer  of ALLETE.  "Equally
important, our automotive acquisitions have positioned us to grow earnings by 12
percent in 2001." Russell noted that ADESA recently acquired 24 auto auctions in
three different transactions.  Based on twelve-month-ended  historical data, the
newly  acquired  auctions sold about  600,000  vehicles,  generating  revenue of
approximately $200 million.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES continued its double-digit growth in net income. The number
of vehicles  sold at ADESA  auctions  increased  23 percent.  Same store  growth
increased  13  percent  as  measured  by  earnings   before   interest,   taxes,
depreciation,  amortization and lease expense.  Vehicles  financed by Automotive
Finance  Corporation  were up 6.5 percent  over the same  period  last year.  In
addition, AFC's loan portfolio is up 15 percent over 1999 to $395 million.

Third  quarter net income from  INVESTMENTS  was lower than 1999  because of two
large real estate  transactions that occurred last year.  Overall,  year-to-date
results for real estate are ahead of last year,  although  they  typically  vary
from  quarter to quarter,  depending  on the timing of major  transactions.  Net
income  from  the  company's   securities   portfolio  and  emerging  technology
investments posted strong increases over last year.

In ENERGY SERVICES,  sales to industrial,  commercial and residential  customers
were up 13 percent and exceeded  record levels that were  achieved in 1999.  Net
income, however,  declined by $7.2 million due in large part to a lack of demand
in the  region's  power  market as a result  of more  moderate  summer  weather.
Transmission constraints were also a factor.

Net income from WATER SERVICES was steady.
