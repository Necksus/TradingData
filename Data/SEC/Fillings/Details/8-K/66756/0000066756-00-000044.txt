ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to Minnesota Power,  Inc.'s  (Minnesota Power or Company) 1999
Form 10-K for background  information on the following update.  Unless otherwise
indicated, cited references are to the Company's 1999 Form 10-K.

Ref. Page 1 - First Paragraph

On August 8, 2000  Minnesota  Power  announced  it will begin doing  business as
ALLETE (NYSE:  ALE),  effective  September 1, 2000. The new name better reflects
the  identity of a  multi-services  company  with  businesses  across the United
States and Canada. The Company's regulated electric business will continue to be
called  Minnesota  Power,  a name  appropriate  for an energy  business  located
primarily in Minnesota.

Shareholders  will be asked to approve  changing the Company's legal name at the
next  annual  meeting  of  shareholders,  which  will be  held  on May 8,  2001.
Headquarters for ALLETE will remain in Duluth, Minnesota.
