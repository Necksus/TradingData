Item 5.  Other Events.

A.   Refund Ordered in Connection with 1993 Rate Case

     On September 12 and 26, 1995, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) 
deliberated on issues pertaining to rates implemented on September 15, 1993, 
pursuant to the FPSC's March 22, 1993, order (the "1993 Order") approving 
uniform rates for 127 of the approximate 150 water and wastewater treatment 
facilities owned by Southern States Utilities (SSU), a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Minnesota Power & Light Company (the Company). In its deliberations, the 
FPSC indicated its intent to issue an order directing SSU to refund, within 90 
days of the date of the order, approximately $8 million to customers who paid 
more since October 1993 under uniform rates than they would have paid under 
stand-alone rates. This intended action by the FPSC is in response to a 
decision by the Florida First District Court of Appeals ruling issued April 6, 
1995, that the FPSC lacked statutory authority to approve the implementation of 
uniform rates in its 1993 Order absent a finding that the localities subject to 
the uniform rates were served by a functionally related system. With "uniform 
rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the same rates for water 
and wastewater services. Uniform rates are an alternative to "stand-alone 
rates" which are calculated based on the cost of serving each locality.

     In the above-referenced deliberations on September 12 and 26, 1995, the 
FPSC indicated that it would not permit SSU to collect $8 million from 
customers who paid less under uniform rates. SSU believes that it would be 
improper for the FPSC to order an $8 million refund to one group of customers 
without permitting SSU to recover $8 million from the remaining customers 
because the First District Court of Appeals only addressed the issue of alleged 
over-payment by some service areas under the uniform rate design and not SSU's 
total revenue requirement. The FPSC renders its decisions through written 
orders. In this case, the FPSC's order is due October 16, 1995. If the 
FPSC's order is consistent with the deliberations as described above, SSU 
intends to request FPSC reconsideration of the order, and if unsuccessful, 
believes it probable SSU will prevail on appeal.

B.   Denial of Interim Rates in 1995 Rate Case, with Opportunity to Refile

     In June 1995 SSU filed a request with the FPSC for a general increase in 
water and wastewater treatment rates. The request seeks to increase revenue by 
about $18.6 million on an annual basis. SSU based this filing on a forward 
looking test period, rather than on a historical test period, to recover costs 
associated with more than $100 million in plant improvements and expansions SSU 
has completed or plans to complete in the 1992-96 period. Much of the work was 
or is required to comply with government safety, environmental protection, and 
water quality standards. In August 1995, the FPSC accepted SSU's rate case. In 
deliberations on October 6, 1995, the FPSC indicated its intent to deny SSU's 
request for interim rates that would increase annual revenue by approximately 
$12 million. Reasons for denial included the fact the FPSC was unable to 
determine interim rates based on stand-alone rates since SSU filed its request 
based on uniform rates. However, in its deliberations, the FPSC recognized the 
unfairness of denying interim rates based upon this reason when, at the time 
SSU filed its rate case, SSU was unaware of the need for inclusion in its 
filing of a stand-alone rate structure. Thus, the FPSC indicated in its 
deliberations that SSU would be permitted, at its discretion, to file a second 
request for interim rates based on a stand-alone rate design. SSU is 
considering the appropriateness of an amended interim rate filing and the 
potential for an appeal to an appropriate state court.
