ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the 1999 Form 10-K of ALLETE, formerly Minnesota Power,
Inc., (Company) for background information on the following updates. Unless
otherwise indicated, cited references are to ALLETE's 1999 Form 10-K.

Ref. Page 1 - First Paragraph
Ref. Form 8-K dated and filed August 8, 2000

On September 1, 2000, as announced, Minnesota Power began doing business as
ALLETE (NYSE: ALE).


Ref. Page 12 - Insert after Third Full Paragraph
Ref. Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 Page 9. - Third Paragraph
Ref. Form 8-K dated and filed June 28, 2000

On August 11, 2000 ADESA  Corporation  (ADESA),  a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of
ALLETE,  acquired Beebe Auto Exchange,  Inc. (Beebe).  The acquisition  included
Mid-Ark Auto Auction (renamed ADESA Little Rock) in North Little Rock,  Arkansas
and Central  Arkansas Auto Auction  (renamed  ADESA Central  Arkansas) in Beebe,
Arkansas. ADESA Little Rock operates ten auction lanes on approximately 81 acres
and ADESA Central Arkansas operates six auction lanes on approximately 66 acres.

On August 31, 2000 ADESA acquired 51 percent of Interstate  Auto Auction located
in Ocala, Florida.  Interstate Auto Auction, which was renamed A & H, LLC and is
doing business as ADESA Ocala, operates five auction lanes on 27 acres.

Effective  October 7, 2000 ADESA acquired nine vehicle  auction  facilities from
Manheim Auctions, Inc. The auctions acquired are:

  -  Southwest  Auto  Auction  (renamed  ADESA  Phoenix)  located in Phoenix,
     Arizona  which  operates 12 auction  lanes on 79 acres;
  -  Golden Gate Auto Auction  (renamed  ADESA  Golden Gate)  located near San
     Francisco, California which operates six auction lanes on 91 acres;
  -  Southern States Vehicle Auction  (renamed ADESA Atlanta) located in metro
     Atlanta, Georgia which operates six auction lanes on 64 acres;
  -  Metro Auto Auction of Kansas City  (renamed  ADESA  Kansas City)  located
     near Kansas City, Missouri which operates seven auction lanes on 90 acres;
  -  Puget Sound Auto Auction  (renamed ADESA Seattle) located in the Seattle,
     Washington area which operates four auction lanes on 40 acres;
  -  Colorado Springs Auto Auction (renamed ADESA Colorado Springs) located in
     Colorado Springs, Colorado which operates three auction lanes on 28 acres;
  -  Bayside Auto Auction  (renamed  ADESA  Tampa)  located in Tampa,  Florida
     which operates  eight auction lanes on 30 acres;
  -  Clearwater Auto Auction (renamed ADESA Clearwater) located in Clearwater,
     Florida which operates four auction lanes on 14 acres; and
  -  Orlando-Sanford  Vehicle Auction (renamed ADESA Orlando-Sanford)  located
     in Orlando, Florida which operates six auction lanes on 45 acres.

These transactions were funded with internally generated funds and the temporary
issuance of short-term  debt.  The Company  expects to refinance the  short-term
debt with the issuance of long-term  debt by the end of October 2000.  ADESA now
owns or leases, and operates 57 vehicle auction facilities throughout the United
States and Canada.

With these  acquisitions  and the acquisition of Auction Finance Group,  Inc. in
June 2000, ALLETE expects the growth rate in operating earnings to increase from
10 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2001.

                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or  on  behalf  of  the  Company  in  this  current   report  on  Form  8-K,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"
"expects,"  "intends,"  "plans,"  "predicts,"  "projects," "will likely result,"
"will continue," or similar  expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

  -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those
     of Congress, state legislatures,  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
     the Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission,  the Florida  Public  Service
     Commission,  the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the Public Service
     Commission of Wisconsin,  with respect to allowed rates of return, industry
     and rate  structure,  acquisition  and  disposal of assets and  facilities,
     operation and construction of plant facilities, recovery of purchased power
     and capital  investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail
     competition  (including but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission
     costs);
  -  economic and geographic factors including political and economic risks;
  -  changes  in and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws  and
     policies;
  -  weather conditions;
  -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;
  -  competition for retail and wholesale customers;
  -  pricing and transportation of commodities;
  -  market demand,  including  structural  market  changes;
  -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
  -  changes in project costs;
  -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
  -  capital  market  conditions;
  -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and
  -  legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal)  and
     settlements that influence the business and profitability of the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of these  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of these
factors on the  business or the extent to which any factor,  or  combination  of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.
