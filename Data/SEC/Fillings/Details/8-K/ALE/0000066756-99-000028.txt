ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December
31, 1998 (1998 Form 10-K) of Minnesota Power, Inc.  (Minnesota Power or Company)
for background  information on the following  update.  The cited reference is to
the Company's 1998 Form 10-K.

Ref. Page 6. - Regulatory Issues
Ref. Page 16. - Item 2 Properties - Electric Operations
Ref. Page 25. - Outlook - Electric Operations - Eighth Paragraph

On June 22, 1999 Minnesota Power  announced  plans to build a natural  gas-fired
power plant near the city of Superior,  Wisconsin.  The combustion turbine power
generating  station will be capable of producing  approximately  90 megawatts of
electric  power and cost  approximately  $35  million  to $40  million to build.
Pending any regulatory  approvals,  construction of the plant would begin during
the year 2000 with completion scheduled in 2002.

Combustion  turbines  produce  low  emissions,  making  them an  environmentally
advantageous  way to  generate  electricity.  The plant  will help  alleviate  a
developing  shortage of  electricity  during periods of peak  electrical  demand
during summer and winter  months,  thereby  improving the  dependability  of the
electric  system for the Company's  customers.  This facility will also help the
Company  avoid  purchasing  higher  cost  power when  other  Company  generating
facilities are down for maintenance.

Company,  purchased  the  Vancouver  Auto  Auction of New  Westminster,  British
Columbia. This auction facility has six lanes and is situated on a 70-acre site.
The  purchase of the  Vancouver  auction  facility is a major  component  of the
Company's  Canadian  growth  strategy.  ADESA now  operates  29 vehicle  auction
facilities.

On June 30, 1999 MP Real Estate Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, purchased, for $45.0 million, certain real estate properties located in
Cape Coral,  Florida,  from a  subsidiary  of Avatar  Holdings  Inc., a publicly
traded developer and home builder  headquartered in Coral Gables,  Florida. Cape
Coral, located adjacent to Fort Myers,  Florida, has a population of 100,000 and
is Florida's  second largest  municipality  in land area.  Properties  purchased
include  approximately  2,500 acres of commercial  and  residential  zoned land,
including  home  sites,  a golf  resort,  marina and  commercial  buildings.  In
exchange for $8.8 million MP Real Estate Holdings, Inc. concurrently assigned to
a third party the rights to a shopping  center and a portion of the vacant land.
The Company funded the net amount of this transaction with internally  generated
funds  and  proceeds  from  the sale of  certain  investments  in the  Company's
securities portfolio.
