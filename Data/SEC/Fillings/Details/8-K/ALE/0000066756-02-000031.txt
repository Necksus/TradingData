ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the 2001 Form 10-K of ALLETE,  Inc. (ALLETE or the Company)
for background  information on the following update. Unless otherwise indicated,
cited references are to ALLETE's 2001 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 11 - Sixth Paragraph
Ref. Page 30 - Third Paragraph
Ref. Form 8-K dated and filed February 28, 2002 - Second Paragraph

On March 27, 2002 ALLETE's wholly owned subsidiary,  ALLETE Water Services, Inc.
(ALLETE Water),  signed a Letter of  Understanding  (filed as Exhibit 99 to this
Form 8-K) with the Florida  Governmental  Utility Authority (FGUA) in connection
with ongoing  negotiations for the sale of all or  substantially  all of Florida
Water Services  Corporation's  (Florida Water) assets. Florida Water is a wholly
owned subsidiary of ALLETE Water.  The Letter of Understanding  was requested by
the FGUA for use in meetings planned with  representatives  of local governments
in areas affected by the proposed asset sale.

The Letter of Understanding confirms the following understandings between ALLETE
Water and the FGUA:

(1)  ALLETE Water agrees to permit the FGUA to  initiate its final due diligence
     process;

(2)  ALLETE Water agrees to terminate its solicitation of competitive  bids from
     other  parties  interested  in  purchasing  the stock or assets of  Florida
     Water; and

(3)  provided that a  definitive  Asset  Acquisition  Agreement, which is  based
     upon the framework of a term sheet appended to the Letter of Understanding,
     is finalized prior to May 14, 2002,  representatives of ALLETE and the FGUA
     agree to recommend to their respective  boards of directors the approval of
     an acquisition by the FGUA of the assets of Florida Water.

Neither  party is bound by the terms of the Letter of  Understanding  until such
time as a definitive asset  acquisition  agreement is approved by its respective
board of directors and is executed.

A term sheet appended to the Letter of Understanding recites a purchase price of
$520 million  which is subject to adjustment  based upon  variations in interest
rates,  provided that ALLETE Water may terminate the transaction if the price is
reduced to $490  million  or less.  If the  transaction  had closed on March 27,
2002,  the interest rate  adjustment  mechanism  would have reduced the price to
approximately $500 million.  If the transaction were to close at a price of $520
million,  ALLETE  estimates  that its net  cash  proceeds  would  be about  $275
million.

Certain  local  governments  may commence  condemnation  proceedings  to acquire
assets outside the FGUA transaction,  or may otherwise attempt to block the FGUA
acquisition  of assets  within their  respective  jurisdictions.  If the City of
Marco  Island  proceeds  with  its  threat  to  purchase  through   condemnation
proceedings  Florida Water assets within its  jurisdiction,  it is  contemplated
that the Marco Island  system would likely be removed from the FGUA  transaction
and the FGUA purchase price would be reduced approximately 22 percent. If one or
more other  local  governments  commence  condemnation  in their  jurisdictions,
ALLETE Water has the option to  terminate  the FGUA  transaction,  or to proceed
with the  transaction as to the remaining  systems if a price  adjustment can be
agreed upon with the FGUA.

The  FGUA and  ALLETE  Water  are  continuing  with  negotiation  of  definitive
agreements  related to the  proposed  transaction.  Assuming  the parties  reach
timely agreement on the issues remaining to be resolved, the FGUA has stated its
intent to hold a public hearing in May 2002 to receive  comments on the proposed
transaction.  The FGUA  board  would then meet for the  purpose  of  determining
whether to authorize execution of a definitive asset acquisition agreement.  The
parties contemplate closing this transaction by October 2002. The asset purchase
agreement  will  contain  conditions  permitting  each  party to  terminate  the
agreement  in the event of certain  circumstances.

                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this Form 8-K, in presentations, in response to questions or
otherwise.   Any  statements  that  express,   or  involve  discussions  as  to,
expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions  or  future  events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"projects,"  "will likely result," "will continue" or similar  expressions)  are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

   -    war and acts of terrorism;
   -    prevailing  governmental  policies  and  regulatory  actions, including
        those of the United States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal
        Energy Regulatory Commission, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,
        the Florida Public  Service  Commission,  the North  Carolina  Utilities
        Commission,  the Public  Service  Commission  of  Wisconsin  and various
        county regulators,  about allowed rates of return, financings,  industry
        and rate  structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities,
        operation and  construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased
        power and capital investments,  and present or prospective wholesale and
        retail competition  (including but not limited to transmission costs) as
        well as general  vehicle-related  laws,  including vehicle brokerage and
        auction laws;
   -    unanticipated  impacts  of  restructuring  initiatives  in  the electric
        industry;
   -    economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;
   -    changes  in  and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws and
        policies;
   -    weather conditions;
   -    population growth rates and demographic patterns;
   -    the effects of competition, including the competition for retail and
        wholesale customers, as well as suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;
   -    pricing and transportation of commodities;
   -    market demand, including structural market changes;
   -    changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
   -    unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;
   -    unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
   -    capital market conditions;
   -    competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;
   -    our ability to manage expansion and integrate recent acquisitions; and
   -    legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and
        settlements that affect the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of these  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of these
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

Re:  Florida Governmental Utility Authority / Florida Water Services Corporation

Dear Mr. Crandell:

This letter confirms the following  understanding between Florida Water Services
Corporation  ("Florida  Water"),  ALLETE Water Services,  Inc. and ALLETE,  Inc.
(collectively,   "ALLETE")  and  the  Florida   Governmental  Utility  Authority
("FGUA"):

1.       Florida  Water  shall  permit  FGUA  representatives  and  experts   to
         immediately  initiate the final due  diligence  process.  Promptly upon
         receipt of this letter signed by you as indicated below, the FGUA shall
         initiate such due diligence activities.

2.       The competitive bid process initiated by Florida Water and ALLETE, with
         respect  to  Florida   Water  stock  or  assets  shall  be   terminated
         immediately and no further  solicitations  or  negotiations  with third
         parties  shall take  place  unless  and until the FGUA  acquisition  of
         Florida  Water is  terminated  by (i) the  failure of the FGUA Board of
         Directors  or the ALLETE Board of Directors to approve on or before May
         14, 2002 the recommendation referenced in paragraph 3 below, or (ii) if
         a  definitive  Asset  Acquisition  Agreement  is signed,  either  party
         terminates the Agreement in accordance with its provisions.

3.       Provided  that  a  definitive Asset  Acquisition Agreement is finalized
         prior to May 14, 2002, we shall  recommend  approval to our  respective
         boards of directors the  acquisition  by the FGUA of the utility system
         assets of Florida Water within the framework of the term sheet attached
         hereto.

If the foregoing correctly states our agreements, please sign this letter in the
space  provided below and return it to me. We look forward to our continued work
together.

Nothing in this  letter  shall be  construed  by either  party as binding on the
other unless and until a definitive Asset  Acquisition  Agreement is approved by
the respective boards of directors and signed by both parties.

Sincerely,

/s/ Charles L. Sweat

                           revenue for the duration of the commitment period.

DUE DILIGENCE:
- --------------
                        -  The GUA will  perform due diligence and  may elect to
                           terminate  the  agreement  as of August 23, 2002 if a
                           material problem affecting the financial condition or
                           operation of any GUA System is identified.

                           Closing.

                           2002  capital  budget in projects  identified  in the

                           determined  by the  number  of  calendar  days  which
                           expire between January 1, 2002 and the closing date.

                        -  The purchase  price will be reduced by any deficiency

                           improvement program.
