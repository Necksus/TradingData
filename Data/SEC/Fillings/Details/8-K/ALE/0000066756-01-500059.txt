                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE which are made in this Form 8-K, in presentations,  in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond the control of ALLETE and may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

     -  war and acts of terrorism;

     -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including
        those of the United States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal
        Energy Regulatory Commission, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,
        the Florida Public  Service  Commission,  the North  Carolina  Utilities
        Commission,  the Public  Service  Commission  of  Wisconsin  and various
        county  regulators,  about  allowed  rates of return,  industry and rate
        structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, operation
        and  construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and
        capital  investments,  and present or  prospective  wholesale and retail
        competition (including but not limited to transmission costs);

     -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

     -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
        policies;

     -  weather conditions;

     -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;

     -  competition for retail and wholesale customers;

     -  pricing and transportation of commodities;

     -  market demand, including structural market changes;

     -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

     -  changes in project costs;

     -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

     -  capital market conditions;

     -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and

     -  legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and
        settlements that influence the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                      ALLETE REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
                      -------------------------------------
                              OF 47 CENTS PER SHARE
                              ---------------------

ALLETE, Inc. (NYSE: ALE) today reported third quarter 2001 earnings of 47 cents
per share versus 50 cents last year. Net income was $37.8 million on quarterly
revenue of $420.2 million, compared with net income of $35.0 million and $323.5
million of revenue for the same period a year ago.

"We are very pleased with our third quarter results, considering the current
national situation," said David Gartzke, ALLETE president. "Energy Services and
our real estate business posted strong earnings. However, the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks did have a negative impact on our financial performance this quarter,
particularly at Automotive Services and our securities portfolio."

ENERGY SERVICES net income rose 51 percent over the same period a year ago,
boosted by stronger trading margins than in 2000 with its cooler-than-normal
summer. Expenses related to a scheduled outage at the Square Butte plant were
recorded during the quarter. The outage has been extended into October, which is
later than originally planned.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES quarterly net income rose 31 percent compared to last year,
even though overall auction activity slowed significantly in the weeks following
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Dealer attendance, the number of vehicles
brought to auction and the percentage of vehicles sold all dropped suddenly
during the last half of September. Automotive Services estimates that the
decreased activity reduced its net income by $3.5 million for the quarter.
Despite this, same-store growth at ADESA locations rose 13 percent for the
quarter, as measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and lease expense.

At Automotive Finance Corporation, the number of vehicles financed increased 13
percent and the accounts receivable portfolio climbed 8 percent to $425 million.
Automotive Services remains on track to achieve 40 percent earnings growth for
2001.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WATER SERVICES net income for the quarter was flat compared to a year ago. A 6
percent decrease in water sales due to wet weather was offset by a gain on asset
sales in Florida resulting from the condemnation of a small water system. The
total number of water customers increased 4 percent compared to third quarter
2000.

Economic fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks also affected earnings from ALLETE's
INVESTMENTS segment. Real estate sales were strong, but turbulence in the
financial markets resulted in a short-term decline in ALLETE's securities
portfolio, which has since recovered.

"As a result of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Square Butte outage extension and
other factors, ALLETE is revising its earnings per share growth projection to
between 6 and 8 percent for 2001 over 2000," Gartzke said.

ALLETE's corporate headquarters are in Duluth, Minn. ALLETE's holdings include
the second largest wholesale automobile auction network in North America; the
leading provider of independent auto dealer inventory financing; the largest
investor-owned water utilities in Florida and North Carolina; significant real
estate holdings in Florida; and a low-cost electric utility that serves some of
the largest industrial customers in the United States. For more information
