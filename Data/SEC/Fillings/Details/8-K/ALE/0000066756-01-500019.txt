                           SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER
              THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf  of  ALLETE  which  are  made in this  current  report  on Form  8-K,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"
"expects," "intends," "plans," "projects," "will likely result," "will continue"
or  similar  expressions)  are not  statements  of  historical  facts and may be
forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond the control of ALLETE and may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

   -  prevailing  governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those
      of the United States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal  Energy
      Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota  Public Utilities  Commission,  the
      Florida  Public   Service   Commission,   the  North  Carolina   Utilities
      Commission,  the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and various county
      regulators,  about allowed rates of return,  industry and rate  structure,
      acquisition  and  disposal  of  assets  and   facilities,   operation  and
      construction of plant facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital
      investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail competition
      (including but not limited to transmission costs);

   -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

   -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;

   -  weather conditions;

   -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;

   -  competition for retail and wholesale customers;

   -  pricing and transportation of commodities;

   -  market demand, including structural market changes;

   -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

   -  changes in project costs;

   -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

   -  capital market conditions;

   -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and

   -  legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or  criminal)  and
      settlements that influence the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                   ALLETE REPORTS SOLID FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS
                   -------------------------------------------

ALLETE (NYSE: ALE) today announced  earnings of 46 cents per share for the first
quarter of 2001,  compared to 43 cents for the first quarter of 2000. Net income
was up 8 percent  to $32.9  million  on  quarterly  revenue  of $413.0  million,
compared  to $30.4  million of net  income and $322.6  million in revenue a year
ago.

"Each of our four  businesses  performed  well this quarter,"  said  Ed Russell,
ALLETE  President and CEO. "Our diverse  strengths in basic  necessities - cars,
electricity, water and real estate - continue to help us prosper during times of
economic challenge."

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  showed  continued  growth  with net income for the quarter
rising by $5.8 million.  The 49 percent  increase over the same period last year
was due in  large  part to  acquisitions  made in 2000 and  increased  financing
activity at Automotive Finance Corporation.

ENERGY SERVICES posted an 11 percent increase in net income due to a combination
of factors.  Property  taxes and O&M expenses  were down compared to a year ago.
Wholesale,  residential  and  commercial  margins were higher than last year and
helped offset a decrease in industrial margins.

WATER SERVICES  experienced  continued  strong customer growth of 6 percent over
the  period.  In  addition,   higher  rates  in  North  Carolina,   productivity
enhancements  and an escrow fund  adjustment  in Florida  helped  this  business
segment  achieve a 29 percent  increase in net income for the quarter  over last
year.

INVESTMENTS  reported a $6.0  million  decrease  in net income for the  quarter,
primarily due to three large real estate transactions that occurred in the first
quarter of 2000. ALLETE Properties recently announced that its largest sale ever
is expected to close in June 2001. The company's securities portfolio saw strong
returns in 2001  compared  to 2000,  but had less cash to invest due to ALLETE's
significant acquisition activity during the past year.
