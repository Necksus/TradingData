Electric Utility Operations

Minnesota Power is a diversified utility company headquartered in Duluth, Minn. 
We provide electric service to 133,000 customers in northern Minnesota and 
northwestern Wisconsin.  Large industrial customers, which account for about 
half our electric revenue, include paper mills and Minnesota's taconite 
industry, which supplies most of the pelletized iron used in U.S. steel-making. 
Wisconsin electric customers are served by our Superior Water, Light and Power 
Company subsidiary.  SWL&P also supplies water and natural gas to about 10,000 
customers in the city of Superior and nearby areas. Another subsidiary, BNI 
Coal, mines and sells lignite coal to two North Dakota mine-mouth generating 
units, one of which supplies Minnesota Power with 71% of its output under a 
long-term contract.

Water Utility Operations

Our Southern States Utilities subsidiary is the largest independent supplier of 
water and wastewater utility service in Florida, serving more than 100 
communities.  Our Heater Utilities subsidiary provides water and wastewater 
services in North Carolina and South Carolina.  SSU and Heater serve a total of 
139,000 water customers and 47,000 wastewater treatment customers. In addition, 
a subsidiary of SSU supplies sanitation service to 12,000 customers in Lehigh 
Acres, a community in southwest Florida.

Investments and Corporate Services

While electric and water utilities are our core businesses, non-regulated 
investments supplement our earnings and, in some cases, perform an economic 
development function in our electric utility service area.  These investments - 
and our ownership stake in them - include a securities portfolio that provides 
funds for reinvestment and business acquisitions (100%); Capital Re 
Corporation, a financial guaranty reinsurance company (21%); Lehigh Acquisition 
Corp., southwest Florida real estate sales (80%); Lake Superior Paper 
Industries, a Duluth paper mill (50%); and Superior Recycled Fiber Industries, 
a Duluth recycled pulp production plant (88%).

Dividends of Change

     Change has been a friend to Minnesota Power.  In the early 1980s, when we 
recognized we could no longer stake our future mainly on selling electricity to 
the iron mining industry, we began to diversify.  We invested in water 
utilities, coal mining, papermaking and other fields.

     In all our businesses, old and new, we're dedicated to continuous 
improvement.  We're adapting to a changing regulatory climate, streamlining and 
becoming more efficient in the way we work, and increasing reliance on team 
dynamics and participatory management.

     In the hands of motivated, goal-oriented men and women, change pays 
important dividends.  Some are intangible yet valuable, others have dramatic 
financial impact such as the example below.  Change has strengthened our 
company.  This report highlights 11 representative Dividends of Change.

The Rewards of 'Partnering'

Most companies have both customers and suppliers. But not all have discovered 
the economic advantage in building cooperative relationships with both groups. 
As an example of "partnering" with a supplier, we've signed a new, more 
flexible contract with our coal hauler, the Burlington Northern Railroad. It's 
based on the assumption that we'll sell more power and buy more coal if we can 
keep our costs down, benefiting our company, the BN, and our customers. Our 
combined savings on the cost of coal and rail transportation is more than $20 
million annually. Eric Norberg, left, and Dave McMillan represent the many 
people of Minnesota Power who presented our case in this landmark negotiation.

A CONVERSATION WITH THE CEO

Arend Sandbulte

How would you assess 1994's financial and operating results?

Earnings of $2.06 per share were disappointing, a 6% decrease from the previous 
year and the lowest in a decade.  The largest single reason for the lower 
earnings was our securities portfolio.  A consistent and substantial 
contributor to our earnings for 10 years, the portfolio was hurt by lower 
market returns, declines in the value of some of its holdings, and a 21-cent-
per-share write-off of one investment early in the year.  Despite that rocky 
start, it finished the year with an after-tax return of 3.8%, but compared with 
the previous year, its income declined 55 cents per share.

Despite the lower earnings per share, 1994 also brought important, positive 
developments for Minnesota Power that should help future earnings.  Northeast 
Minnesota's taconite plants and paper mills had a good year, and this spurred 
our electric utility business to its second-highest kilowatt-hour sales ever.  
Six of our nine largest power customers extended their contracts with us.  We 
received a rate increase, the first since 1981, and our rates remain well below 
national and regional utility averages. BNI Coal broke records, and Superior 
Recycled Fiber Industries was profitable its first year out of the gate. Lake 
Superior Paper, with help from price increases, turned the corner in the fourth 
quarter and is positioned for higher profits this year.  Water utility earnings 
were hurt by abnormally high rainfall; we continue upgrading water facilities, 
improving customer service, and laying the groundwork for returns that more 
fairly reflect our investment in the water business.  Finally, we signed an 
agreement to acquire 80% ownership in ADESA Corporation, a business we believe 
will give us the growth we need to achieve our financial goals in the coming 
years.

What are the Company's financial goals?

Our goal is to increase earnings to a minimum of $3.25 per share by the year 
2000.  We expect the earnings to come, approximately one-third each, from 
electric utility operations, water utility operations, and other investments, 
the largest of which would be ADESA.  That may look like a stretch, but I'm 
confident we can do it.

Minnesota Power's stock price has dropped roughly 30% from the highs it hit in 
autumn 1993.  Why?

The rising interest rates of the last year and a half have hurt most utility 
stocks and probably account for much of our price decline. Beyond that, three 
things happened. One was the National Steel taconite plant shutdown in late 
1993 and, although the plant restarted last August, the stock market has not 
yet given back to us the price drop that hit when the closing was announced. 
Second, our first-quarter securities portfolio loss dashed expectations for 
earnings growth in 1994. Finally, the announcement of our planned ADESA 
acquisition in January 1995 created additional uncertainty that seemed to keep 
our stock from sharing in some gains that other utility stocks enjoyed early 
this year.

What is the Company doing to improve its stock price?

In the long run, of course, the most important thing will be performance:  We 
intend to increase our earnings by providing exceptional customer service at 
competitive prices.  In the shorter term, perception is also important, and I 
think the stock price reflects some uneasiness analysts are currently feeling 
about our Company.  One problem is that diversification, which has benefited us 
significantly for the past decade, has also made us more complex to understand. 
That's where communication can help.  We'll work hard in 1995 to help investors 
understand our business prospects, and then hopefully they'll appraise our 
future the way we do.  As a diversified utility, Minnesota Power offers 
investors an attractive combination - solid utility businesses coupled with 
non-regulated investments that give us more growth potential than a "plain 
vanilla" utility.  That's the message we're carrying to Wall Street.

Are you concerned about the Company's high dividend payout?

In 1994 we paid out in dividends 98% of our earnings.  That's high, but given 
our cash resources and our lack of major utility construction needs, it should 
not be detrimental.  Longer-term, our goal is to reduce dividend payout to 70% 
of earnings; unlike some utilities, however, we don't plan to do it by reducing 
dividends but rather by increasing earnings.  We're confident we can increase 
earnings, and this is the message I believe our board of directors was sending 
when we raised the dividend in January 1995.

Do you think market concerns about electric utility deregulation and 
competition are hurting us?

It's possible.  There's a perception in the market that retail electric 
competition, if it comes, is going to be somewhat more difficult for us than 
for the typical utility because we have large 

                                   - 6 -

<PAGE>
industrial customers who theoretically might be courted by other power 
suppliers if there were full retail competition.  I don't agree. In 1994 six of 
our nine largest industrial power customers extended their long-term contracts; 
this doubled the amount of revenue under contract between now and 2005, and the 
average contract duration is now between six and seven years. Our customers 
aren't signing with us just because we're nice folks (although we are).  
They're doing it because our retail rates are the lowest in the region and 
among the lowest in the country. Our customers are voting with their contract-
signing pens, and not with their feet.

How will you keep electric rates competitive?

Smart cost control is the answer. We'll be spending somewhat less on 
construction over the next several years, compared with prior years. We're 
being more aggressive in seeing if we can't use existing facilities longer than 
we might have in the past. We're focusing expenditures in areas where there are 
good possibilities for either substantial savings or revenue growth. A new 
customer information system we put in place in 1994 will help us serve 
customers better and more efficiently.  A new energy management system, 
beginning in 1995, will help us compete for regional electric sales and provide 
new power-related services in the future.  

Do you see growth opportunities for the electric utility?

If we serve our customers well, we'll do well. We will pursue any growth 
initiatives, traditional or not, that have a reasonable chance of being 
profitable. There are some growth constraints, however, such as demand-side 
management, the conservation ethic, and the lack of customer growth in our 
service area. On the other hand, there are processes in the steel and paper 
industries that can be done electrically that are now being done less 
efficiently with other energy forms. New electrotechnologies can mean sales 
growth for us and solve problems for customers by removing production 
bottlenecks and helping them remain competitive in their markets.

What's your assessment of utility competition/deregulation scenarios?

Generally, I feel fewer electric utility CEOs now believe there will be wide-
open retail competition than, say, a year ago. The shock wave from California's 
deregulation proposal has subsided. Ironically, one factor tending to slow 
retail competition is that utilities, including us, have been acting more and 
more as if full competition and deregulation had already occurred.  We've been 
trimming costs and offering large industrial customers rate flexibility for 
years. The gates of competition may open further, but many issues need to be 
addressed first. Besides utilities themselves and their customers, myriad 
federal and state regulatory bodies have stakes in the outcome and roles to 
play. Sorting out the complexities and resolving the issues will not be easy, 
and there will be reluctance to jeopardize the benefits traditional regulation 
has given us. Hopefully, rationality and logic will prevail, as well as a sense 
of fairness in how to handle utility investments made in good faith under the 
present system of regulation.

What are the growth prospects for water utilities?

Customer growth in our water utility businesses has been running 3% to 4% per 
year, not counting acquisitions or asset sales. There will probably be more 
opportunities for water utility acquisitions because the industry is still 
fragmented.  Nationally, there's a trend toward privatization of smaller 
municipal systems,


This ad ran in regional newspapers following the January 1995 announcement of 
our dividend increase.

Minnesota Power's 25th Consecutive Dividend Increase

On the occasion of our 25th consecutive annual dividend increase*, we'd like to 
tell you about our course for the future.

Some utilities have cut dividends. Not Minnesota Power. Our policy is to 
maintain our dividend, and to keep raising it as earnings grow. It yields 8% 
based on our current stock price of about $25.

In the mid-80s, we realized we should no longer rely exclusively on our 
electric business. We have the financial strength to diversify, and we're doing 
it with ingenuity and success. The new Minnesota Power has three main parts:

[CLIPART OF ELECTRICAL PLUG]
Our traditional electric utility base, including secure long-term contracts 
with large industrial customers, and 11.6% authorized return.

[CLIPART OF WATER FAUCET]
Water utilities, growing and providing an increasingly valuable commodity in 
Florida and the Carolinas.

[CLIPART OF THREE ARROWS]
Nonregulated affiliates, with potential growth and returns higher than 
utilities.

* On January 25, Minnesota Power (NYSE:MPL) increased the dividend on its 
common stock, equivalent to an annual rate of $2.04, compared with $2.02 paid 
in 1994. This higher quarterly dividend is payable March 1 to shareholders of 
record on February 15.

and we may be able to either buy them or manage them for a fee. Beyond actual 
utility operations, there are other water-related services and products we 
could offer.

Does the pending ADESA acquisition signal a shift in 
diversification strategy, in that it is so different from any 
of our other businesses?

Certainly, the type of service ADESA performs is a departure, but ADESA is more 
like other businesses we have than you might think - and in some very key ways. 
Since 1983, financial services have been an important component of our Company; 
our securities portfolio and Capital Re, the reinsurance firm of which we own 
21%, are both examples. ADESA, too, provides a corporate service: It brings 
auto buyers and sellers together, similar to a stock or commodity exchange.  
ADESA does not own the vehicles it auctions, but rather provides services for 
both buyers and sellers. It's a niche service business for the automotive 
industry, which is huge.  And ADESA is a large player in this niche. 
This acquisition may have little to do with utilities, but it has a lot to do 
with our profit strategy. I recently reviewed a Wall Street Journal article 
from September of 1993 that talks about Cox Broadcasting, a private firm that 
owns Manheim, the largest auto auction company. Cox is considered an astute 
company. The article, in sum, said that auto auctions had nothing to do with 
Cox's broadcasting business, but had a lot to do with its profits.

Headquartered in Indianapolis, ADESA operates auto auctions at Indianapolis, 
Boston, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati/Dayton, Knoxville, Lexington, Memphis, 
Charlotte, Birmingham, Sarasota/Bradenton, Miami and Austin. In Canada ADESA 
auctions are at Montreal, Ottawa and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

[MAP INDICATING LOCATIONS OF ADESA'S AUTO AUCTIONS]

The ADESA File

Merger Proposal

Agreement is for us to buy an 80% stake in ADESA Corporation for $167 million 
($162 million upon completing merger plus $5 million for stock owned prior to 
merger agreement).  The companies' boards have approved a definitive merger 
agreement, and ADESA shareholders will vote on it in April.

The Business

North America's third-largest auto auction company, ADESA owns and operates 16 
facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Auction buyers are car dealers; sellers 
include domestic auto manufacturers, import auto makers, car dealers, 
fleet/lease companies, banks and finance companies.  Revenue comprises auction 
fees paid by sellers and buyers and charges for auxiliary services that include 
auto reconditioning, body and paint work, remarketing, dealer financing and 
transportation services.

The Numbers

ADESA sold 410,000 vehicles in 1994, generating net income of $7.8 million on 
revenue of $94 million.  In 1992 it sold 184,000 cars, with net income of $3.6 
million and revenue of $46 million.

Growth Strategy

To acquire and consolidate independent auto auctions and begin new ones.

Customer Philosophy

To have "a servant's attitude," ready to do whatever is necessary to serve 
those who use ADESA auctions.

But other utilities are not out buying car auctions.

The fact that a host of other utilities aren't following the same strategy we 
are doesn't worry me, actually. I'm not a contrarian by nature, but I don't 
think following the same path every other utility follows will necessarily lead 
to success. A crowded path may mean there isn't that much revenue and earnings 
growth available, and the competition will be intense. We've looked at a lot of 
businesses in the 12 years since we decided to diversify, we've studied ADESA 
in detail, and that's why we're confident it's a good buy for us and at a fair 
price.

What was the process used to find ADESA?

First we worked through a firm that finds potential buys for companies that are 
looking to expand through acquisition.  We wanted a business with manageable 
risk and the potential for growth and returns higher than those of a typical 
utility business.  We looked at firms in 25 to 30 different industries, 
beginning with utility-related businesses and then gradually broadening our 
scope.  We considered international electric utility operations, but ruled them 
out because we felt they were too risky.  We looked at oil and gas exploration, 
finally rejecting this business because it's too cyclical.  We considered title 
insurance, but that business, too, is cyclical and linked to interest rates.  
Manufacturing was too capital-intensive.  ADESA surfaced as a potential 
acquisition in mid-1994 and appeared to meet most of our criteria.  We studied 
it thoroughly, involving our own corporate development people as well as 
outside investment advisors.  Our first impression, like many people's, was 
colored by stereotypes about used car salesmen.  A closer look dispelled the 
stereotypes, however.  And the closer we looked, the more we were impressed 
with ADESA's business prospects and the better the financial fit we saw between 
the two companies.

What do you like about ADESA?

Its business fundamentals are solid. It's not cyclical. It has good cash flow, 
and its revenue and income growth have been in the range of 30% a year for the 
past three years.  Growth in the auto redistribution industry overall has 
averaged about 10% a year for the past decade, reflecting a growing supply of 
rental cars, a boom in leasing as well as the increasing price of new vehicles. 
We also like that this business is not as capital-intensive as our utility 
businesses.  For example, our electric utility had over $3 invested in 
facilities to earn $1 of revenue in 1994.  In contrast, ADESA generated about 
$1.25 in revenue for every $1 of capital it had invested in facilities. That's 
an advantage when you're planning on expanding.  Another thing we liked about 
ADESA is that its values were compatible with ours.

What values do you mean?

I mean basic values:  Ethics.  Honesty.  Being customer-oriented.  Its auction 
facilities are huge, modern, spotless.  It reconditions the cars and does 
repainting and body work. It delivers vehicles to and from customers, using its 
own fleet of modern transport trailers.  It provides remarketing services and 
makes short-term loans to dealers until they sell the vehicles. It handles all 
the paperwork, using computerized equipment to expedite the process at every 
point.  ADESA provides one-stop shopping for car dealers.

What does Minnesota Power bring to the merger?

Our primary role is to provide expansion capital in accordance with approved 
business plans. We're not going to try to reculturize ADESA or make a utility 
out of them. We want them to continue to do what they've been doing, only more 
of it and even better.  That's why we're retaining ADESA's key top managers; 
they will run the business and direct its growth.

How will the company expand?

We believe the auto redistribution business, like the water utility business 
since the mid-1980s, is in a period of consolidation. There are three large 
players in the industry, of which ADESA is the third-largest. But over half the 
13 million vehicles a year that go through auctions are handled by independent 
companies that typically don't offer the breadth of service ADESA does.  ADESA 
will expand by acquiring independent auctions and starting up large, new 
facilities. Its existing auctions can also become more profitable by handling 
more cars.

Even if ADESA does well, how can you earn a good return when you pay such a 
premium for the business?

It's true that if you divide the company's past-year income by the $167 million 
we are paying to acquire 80% ownership, it works out to a single-digit return. 
Believe me, we do not part with that much money easily.  But we learned early 
in our diversification efforts that you have to pay a premium for a good 
business.  The way you increase the return is through growth and expansion.

What do you look for in 1995 in terms of Minnesota Power's overall performance?

I look to 1995 for a better financial year for our paper and recycled fiber 
businesses, better results in our water businesses, and continued good earnings 
for the electric utility. We expect to close the ADESA deal and tell our story 
effectively to investors so they fully understand our Company's strengths and 
so our stock is fully valued in the market.  And, of course, we'll prove that 
value through performance.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all Company employees for their 
hard work over the past year. The 11 accomplishments featured in this report 
are representative of the kind of work our employees do whether they live in 
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida, the Carolinas or North Dakota.  I would also 
like to thank shareholders and ask for your continuing support as we try to 
increase the value of your investment and make you proud to own part of 
Minnesota Power.

REVIEW AND OUTLOOK
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

     Once exclusively an electric utility, Minnesota Power has in the past 
decade invested in a variety of non-electric businesses.

     Our purpose in diversifying was threefold:  First, we wanted to reduce the 
Company's heavy dependence on electric sales to a small number of large 
customers in taconite mining, an industry whose fate is tied to steel 
manufacturing.  Second, we wanted to increase our growth potential beyond what 
we projected for our electric business.  Third, in the case of investments such 
as our Duluth paper and recycled pulp plants, we also wanted to create jobs and 
boost the economy in our electric utility service area.
     We feel diversification has served us well and is a valid strategy for 
meeting our future goals: 
     .    To increase earnings to a minimum of $3.25 per share by the year 
2000; 
     .    To maintain our financial strength and increase the value of our 
shareholders' investment; and 
     .    To nurture a customer-driven, quality-oriented corporate culture 
that is both internally cooperative and externally competitive.
     To hit our earnings target, we will need to sustain the good financial 
performance of our electric utility, achieving our authorized rate of return.  
We will need earnings growth from our water utilities through customer growth, 
additional acquisitions, and rates that reflect our investment in facilities to 
meet increasing water demand and government-mandated environmental standards.
     This won't be enough, however.  We will need to supplement the regulated 
income from our electric and water utilities with income growth and higher 
returns from non-regulated businesses.

     Our goal is that by the year 2000 each of our core businesses, electric 
and water utilities, would provide about one-third of Minnesota Power's income. 
The remaining third would come from non-regulated investments, including a 
proposed acquisition we announced recently.In February 1995 Minnesota Power and 
ADESA Corporation signed a merger agreement in which ADESA, an auto auction 
firm with 16 outlets in the United States and Canada, would become our 80%-
owned subsidiary.

The Paper Goes 
'Round and Round'

In 1994 Minnesota Power's electric utility operations collected and recycled 
98,362 lbs. of white paper, 99,079 lbs. of mixed paper plus mountains of 
magazines, phone books, cardboard, newsprint, aluminum, glass and plastic - all 
because Cindy McLean decided one day in 1989 that "somebody should get us 
organized." Most collected materials are sold. (Paper goes to our Superior 
Recycled Fiber Industries operation.) The reduced cost of trash hauling is a 
valuable bonus.  In the photo, Cindy is pictured on the right with Debbie 
Bulloch, who recently took over the leadership of the 
recycling program.

<PAGE>
The $167 million transaction is scheduled for completion in the second quarter 
of 1995 following approval by ADESA shareholders.
     The money for buying and expanding ADESA and the possible acquisition of 
more water companies will come mainly from our securities portfolio.  We expect 
to retain our investment in Capital Re Corporation.  We will continue selling 
our southwest Florida real estate and expect to sell all or nearly all the 
property by 2000.
     Another shift in resources is possible in 1995.  Pentair, Inc. - our 
joint-venture partner in Lake Superior Paper Industries - has announced its 
desire to exit the paper business, which would likely entail selling LSPI.  We 
believe a sale could improve the chances for expanding the Duluth mill, which 
was originally designed for more than one paper machine.  Our position as half-
owner is that we would join in a sale under the right conditions.  If LSPI is 
sold, it may be logical to also consider a simultaneous sale of Superior 
Recycled Fiber Industries (SRFI), whose paper recycling/pulp production plant 
is adjacent to and operated by LSPI.

1994 Performance

     Earnings per share of common stock for 1994 were $2.06, compared with 
$2.20 in 1993 and $2.47 in 1992.

     The largest single factor in the lower earnings was a decline in the 
performance of the Company's securities investment portfolio.

     Though the portfolio was profitable for the year, its income was reduced 
55 cents per share from the previous year due to lower returns, including 
declines in the value of some securities, and the 21-cent-per-share write-off 
of one investment. Also contributing to lower 1994 earnings was an 11-cent-per-
share loss from our investment in Reach All Partnership, a Duluth manufacturer 
of truck-mounted lifting equipment in which the Company has an 82.5% interest.
     Kilowatt-hour sales increased 4% in 1994, reflecting an increase in sales 
to large industrial customers and resale customers.  Despite this and higher 
retail electric rates that went into effect on an interim basis March 1, 1994, 
income from electric utility operations was down  from the previous year.
     The Company's water utility operations were helped by higher rates, but 
that benefit was offset by heavy summer rains that reduced water consumption.  
A $19.1 million gain from the sale of water plant facilities increased water 
utility operations income over 1993, contributing 42 cents per share to income.
     Minnesota Power's coal mining business and sales of Florida real estate 
turned in solid performances in 1994,surpassing their 1993 income.  Our Duluth 
paper mill, helped by a rebound in paper prices last fall, went from a $3.7 
million pre-tax loss in 1993 to a $3.1 million pre-tax profit for 1994; the 
Company recognizes 50% of the mill's pre-tax earnings.  SRFI, which began 
operating in late 1993, contributed $906,000 to corporate earnings in 1994.

<PAGE>
COMPARING FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM 1994, 1993 AND 1992

Operating Revenue and Income

     Electric utility operations revenue was lower in 1994 than 1993, because 
the Company recognized $5.1 million of unbilled revenue and recovered $14.6 
million more of coal contract termination costs in 1993. Also, National Steel 
Pellet Co., a taconite producer that purchases its electricity from the 
Company, operated for seven months in 1993 compared with four months in 1994. 
Additional revenue in 1994 of $11.1 million from the interim rate increase 
partially offset the decreases in revenue. Revenue was higher in 1993 than 
1992, because 1993 included $4 million more of the coal contract termination 
cost recovery, $2.5 million more in unbilled revenue, and increased sales to 
resale customers.
     Water utility operations revenue was higher in 1994 than 1993 because of 
higher water rates and a $19.1 million gain from the sale of water plant 
assets. However, 1994 revenue from ongoing operations was less than expected 
because abnormally high rainfall reduced consumption 8%. Revenue was higher in 
1993 than 1992 because of higher water rates.
     Investments and corporate services revenue was higher in 1994 than 1993 
because SRFI, which began operating in November 1993, had $47.2 million more 
revenue in 1994. The $10.1 million write-off of an investment, lower returns 
and the decline in value of some securities due to higher interest rates 
lowered 1994 income. 1993 income was increased by a $2.7 million gain on a 
leveraged preferred stock investment but reduced by $8.1 million to reflect new 
accounting rules for employee stock ownership plans. 1992 income includes a 
$5.1 million gain from the redemption by the issuer of a preferred stock 
investment.

Operating Expenses

     Fuel and purchased power expenses were lower in 1994 than 1993 because the 
monthly amortization of coal contract termination costs was completed in March 
1994; 1993 included $14.6 million more of these costs than 1994. 1994 expenses 
included additional purchased power to provide for unscheduled outages at our 
Boswell power plant and to meet unexpected demand from three taconite 
customers. Expenses were higher in 1993 than 1992 because additional purchased 
power was used during scheduled maintenance at Company power plants.
     Operations expenses were higher in 1994 than 1993, reflecting the fact 
that SRFI began full operations in November 1993.  Expenses were higher in 1993 
than 1992 due to scheduled power plant maintenance and higher property taxes.
     Administrative and general expenses were higher in 1994 than 1993 and 1992 
due to salary and benefit increases.
     Interest expense was higher in 1994 than 1993, reflecting $45 million of 
new debt financing obtained for SRFI at the end of 1993.  Expense was lower in 
1993 than 1992 because of refinancings at lower interest rates.
     Income from equity investments was higher in 1994 than 1993 because of 
additional income from our increased ownership in Capital Re and improved 
earnings from LSPI due to higher paper prices. Income was lower in 1993 than 
1992 because of LSPI's loss. The Company recognized losses from its investment 
in Reach All in all three years.
     Income tax expense was lower in 1994 than 1993.  Effective tax rates were 
25.9% in 1994, 30.1% in 1993, and 26.9% in 1992.  The effective tax rate was 
lower in 1994 than 1993, due primarily to tax credits generated by affordable 
housing investments and the recognition of income from escrow funds that had 
been previously taxed.  The effective tax rate was higher in 1993 than 1992, 
reflecting a 1% increase in the federal income tax rate in 1993 and fewer tax

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

     Electric utilities are undergoing a transformation as efforts to stimulate 
competition begin to take effect. How far open competition will go and whether 
it will apply to retail customers, however, is not clear.

     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposals have altered the 
competitive landscape, affecting transmission access and pricing. Under FERC's 
transmission access policies, competitors can gain access to a utility's 
transmission system, at rates set by FERC, to compete for sales to the 
utility's wholesale customers.  While utilities have commonly allowed use of 
their lines for wholesale power transactions, most object to being required to 
transmit or "wheel" a competing electric supplier's power to the utility's own 
retail customers.
     With our low rates, Minnesota Power is well positioned to meet 
competition. However, we remain opposed to retail wheeling. We believe it would 
benefit only a few large customers while causing smaller users' rates to rise 
dramatically and shareholder returns to fail to pay for capacity built on the 
strength of future promises of cost recovery.  At present there are no 
proposals that, in our view, adequately address this stranded investment issue.
     Recent developments suggest that retail wheeling, if it comes, is not 
expected for some time.  Though Minnesota and other states are studying it - 
the most publicized proposal has been in California - retail wheeling is in use 
only in rare locations in this country.  One disincentive is that states like 
Minnesota require utilities to invest in social and environmental programs that 
could be jeopardized if their electric utilities had to compete head-to-head 
with outside energy suppliers.  Moreover, Minnesota's generally low electric 
rates, half those of California, provide little incentive to change a system 
that has been working well.

     Despite uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of change in our industry, 
Minnesota Power is preparing for a more competive future.

     Our methods include cost cutting, pursuing legislative and regulatory 
reforms to assure we compete with other power suppliers on a level playing 
field, realigning our business functions to make it easier to price and market 
"unbundled" products and services, and cementing relationships with customers 
through innovative pricing and excellent service. We will learn more about our 
customers as well as our competitors and use that information strategically.  
We expect to expand our product offerings and build our customer base through 
economic development and other initiatives. We will continue working to extend 
electric service contracts with our largest customers, a strategy that achieved 
good results in 1994.
     We see ourselves increasingly as energy service providers.  We look at our 
customers' objectives as joint challenges. By finding ways to help them 
conserve energy and cut costs, we help them become more productive. And that 
increased productivity, we have found, can result in increased electric power 
use longer-term for industrial customers as they compete with other operations.
     We also encourage energy-saving electrotechnologies. We are promoting 
ground-source heat pumps in residential and commercial markets. More efficient 
than conventional

Ashes to Ashes

The northern Minnesota community of Hibbing, a Minnesota Power wholesale 
electric customer, had a problem.  The city, which operates a power plant of 
its own, was running out of landfill space for its 7,000 tons of ash per year. 
We offered to dispose of it at the Boswell Energy Center ash pond. Trucks that 
carry the ash away make the trip pay by back-hauling coal, which fuels 
Hibbing's power plant. It's a creative, economical, environmentally sound 
solution. Pictured: Heidi Jagodzinski, Boswell environmental engineer, 
submitted the ash disposal plan to the state. Jack Hokkanen is a customer 
representative for our large municipal accounts. Both credit others for making 
the idea work.

electric heating and cooling systems, ground-source heat pumps are especially 
cost-effective where the user wants both air conditioning and heating. With 
normal usage, energy savings will offset installation costs in three to five 
years.

     The continued financial health of Minnesota Power's electric utility 
business depends on the financial viability of our large industrial customers, 
particularly taconite producers and paper manufacturers.

     Both industries compete in global markets and, therefore, need to control 
costs and increase their productivity.  Through energy audits, we have helped 
our large industrial customers identify cost-effective conservation measures as 
well as projects that will improve production efficiencies.  These improvements 
are funded through state-mandated Conservation Improvement Program grants.
     In many ways, we have always competed to serve our large industrial 
customers.  Because of their size, they have had the option to generate their 
own power if they felt they could do it more economically than buying from us.  
Paper mills, which require steam for their manufacturing process, are ideal 
candidates for building their own cogeneration facilities, which operate 
efficiently by burning a fuel to make steam for papermaking as well as electric 
generation.  Federal law says that when cogenerators meet certain conditions, 
utilities must purchase their surplus power.
     In recent years, the Company has offered customers a wider choice of 
electric service options.  For example, interruptible rates for large 
industrial customers offer a price discount in return for agreeing to have 
service interrupted on occasion.  Another example:  state law allows us, with 
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approval, to offer lower rates to service 
area customers who could otherwise obtain energy from an unregulated supplier 
or generate their own electricity.  The Company is exploring the joint 
development of cogeneration facilities with some of its key customers to meet 
future energy needs.

1994 Performance

     The Company's electric utility business performed well in 1994.  Kilowatt-
hour sales rose 4% to their second-highest level ever despite the idling of one 
of our largest customers for seven months of the year.

     Revenue was boosted by a 7% interim retail rate increase.  Customers also 
saw the full impact of savings from new coal purchase and transportation 
contracts, which more than offset the final electric rate increase for our 
largest customers and reduced it for others.  In the 

                                   - 14 -

<PAGE>
second half of the year, six of our nine largest industrial customers extended 
their electric service contracts, more than doubling the amount of revenue 
committed to us in the 1995-2005 period.
     We sharpened our focus on customer service, streamlining operations in 
some areas while emphasizing others where there is the greatest potential for 
growth and likelihood of competition.  We also realigned the functions in our 
electric utility business to address the more competitive future many are 
predicting for our industry.

     Two industries - taconite production and the manufacture of paper and wood 
products - accounted for 49% of the Company's electric operating revenue in 
1994, versus 48% in 1993 and 51% in 1992.

     An encouraging development during 1994 was the dramatic turnaround in the 
market for pulp and paper. Electric sales to paper and other wood-products 
customers in 1994 were up 5% over 1993 and 3% over 1992. Paper and wood-
products firms provided 14% of electric operating revenue each of the last 
three years.
     The paper industry is in better condition than it has been in many years. 
Its additional energy use benefited us, as we provide power to all four of 
northern Minnesota's largest paper mills.  During the year we extended power 
contracts with Blandin Paper Co., Boise Cascade, and Lake Superior Paper 
Industries. One existing customer, Potlatch Corporation's paper division in 
Brainerd, signed a four-year contract as a Large Power customer for 10 
megawatts through November 1999; MPUC approval has been requested.
     Taconite production provided 35% of electric operating revenue in 1994, 
34% in 1993 and 37% in 1992.  An important raw material for steelmaking, 
taconite pellets are made from iron-bearing rock. In an energy-intensive 
process, the rock is blasted from the earth, crushed and ground into powder. 
The iron is magnetically separated, concentrated and rolled into a pellet with 
a uniform 65% iron content for shipping to steel mills on the lower Great 
Lakes.
     In 1994 the taconite industry recorded its best year since 1981, producing 
more than 43 million tons of pellets, and it is expecting to produce 
approximately 48 million tons in 1995. In August 1994 we resumed providing 
power to National after a lapse of 12 months while the plant was idled. The 
Keewatin, Minn., plant is now fully operational and is expected to produce 5 
million tons of taconite pellets in 1995, more than 10% of Minnesota's total 
projected shipments. Though we had largely compensated for the loss of this 
business through tight cost controls and the sale of power to other utilities, 
National's return is a boon to the region and sounds an encouraging note for 
1995.
     In addition to signing a 10-year contract with National, we renewed 
contracts with USX's Minntac plant and Hibbing Taconite. In January 1995, we 
extended our contract to supply power to Eveleth Mines through 1999.

     In November the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission granted us a retail 
rate increase, our first since 1981.

     The new rates will increase annual revenue by about $19 million, beginning 
in 1995. Our initial request, filed in January 1994, had been for a $34 million 
increase, but we reduced it to $27 million for 1994 and $23 million for

Increased Coal-Handling Efficiency at Boswell

Teamwork is paying off in the coal yard at our largest power plant, Boswell 
Energy Center, near Cohasset, Minn. By modifying their coal-handling system, 
Boswell workers improved efficiency and eliminated the need for one dozer, 
saving its leasing, fuel, and maintenance costs. A new stacker and changes in 
conveyor routing make it possible to unload an entire train without moving coal 
to remote stockpiles, adding flexibility and efficiency in feeding the coal to 
the boilers. The improvement is too new to report cost savings, but they will 
be substantial. Among key members of the changeover team are, from left, Mark 
Pinney, fuels planner; Ed Mackey, utility operator; Tom Geiselman, engineer; 
and Joe Reis, senior instrument and control specialist.

Comparing Results from 
1994 and 1993

     Total electric sales increased 4% primarily because of increased sales to 
large industrial customers, wholesale customers and other power suppliers.  
Revenue increased $11.1 million from interim rates collected since March 1, 
1994, and  $7.8 million from the recovery of CIP expenses in 1994.  Approval by 
the MPUC initiated recovery of CIP expenses beginning Jan. 1, 1994.  Revenue 
was lowered by $12.4 million because of reduced demand revenue from National 
and lower rates associated with interruptible service.  The Company also 
completed recovery of the remaining $3.9 million of coal contract buyout costs 
in March 1994, whereas 1993 included $18.5 million, a full year of recovery.  
Additionally, the unbilled revenue adjustment added $5.1 million to revenue in 
1993.
     Electric operations earned a return of 12.8% on average common equity 
devoted to electric utility plant in 1994, compared with 12.4% in 1993.

Comparing Results from 
1993 and 1992

     Despite work stoppages at two of the Company's largest industrial 
customers, revenue was slightly higher in 1993 due to increased sales to resale 
and other customers.  In addition, a $5.1 million adjustment relating to the 
recognition of unbilled revenue increased 1993 electric utility operations 
revenue.
     Electric operations earned a 12.4% return on average common equity devoted 
to the electric utility plant in 1993, compared with 14.4% in 1992. These 
returns do not include the recognition of unbilled revenue. The recognition of 
a $3.4 million revenue credit from a court decision contributed to the higher 
return in 1992.

1995 to reflect updated revenue and expense projections. The MPUC authorized an 
11.6% return on equity invested in our electric utility.
     Just as important to us for competitive reasons, the MPUC supported our 
request that the increase be larger for residential customers to reflect the 
higher cost of serving them and the need to keep the region's industrial 
customers competitive in their global markets.
     As a result of the rate increase, rates for large industrial customers 
will rise less than 4%, while those for small businesses will go up 6.5%. The 
increase for residential customers will be phased in over three years: 13.5% 
beginning 

                                   - 16 -

<PAGE>
in 1995, 3.75% in January 1996 and another 3.75% in January 1997.  Even after 
the full increase, our residential customers will still pay nearly 25% less 
than the 1994 national average.
     The increase for large industrial users will be more than offset by 
savings in coal purchase and transportation  costs, savings we are passing on 
to all customers. The savings result from new contracts negotiated with 
suppliers in recent years and whose full effect began being felt in 1994.
     The MPUC's 1994 rate decision also allows us to recover through rates $1.3 
million a year to pay for decommissioning coal-fired power plants when they 
reach the end of their useful lives.
     The new rates are expected to go into effect in the second quarter of 
1995.  However, the Company began collecting an interim rate increase of 7% on 
March 1, 1994.  In second quarter 1995 we expect to determine amounts of 
interim rate-related revenue, if any, the Company must refund with interest to 
customers.  As of Dec. 31, 1994, the Company had reserved $6.1 million of the 
interim rate revenue for anticipated refunds.
     The rate increase seems to have had little effect on the Company's good 
standing with customers. A recent opinion survey indicates that we have a 
favorable rating of 91% among residential customers, compared with 92% in 1993. 
Across the nation, a typical favorability rating for electric utilities is 71%.

     Minnesota requires electric utilities to spend 1.5% of their electric 
revenue on conservation improvement programs (CIP) each year.

     Because taconite and paper customers provide the bulk of Minnesota Power's 
electric operating revenue, the  largest of these programs are targeted at 
them. CIP also funds demand-side management grants, awarded on a competitive 
basis to commercial and small industrial customers, as well as energy 
conservation initiatives aimed at all our customers.  In 1995 we proposed a 
program that would allow us to provide low-cost financing for energy-saving 
investments.
     State law allows utilities to recover state-approved conservation program 
costs through an annual customer billing adjustment. In January 1994 the 
Company began recovering ongoing 1994 CIP spending and $8.2 million of CIP 
spending from previous years.  The billing adjustment, which must be 
reauthorized by the MPUC annually, has been allowing us to recover not only 
what we spend on these energy-saving programs, but also "lost margins" 
associated with power saved as a result of them.  1994 electric operating 
revenue included $7.8 million of CIP-related revenue.  About $5.7 million for 
CIP expenditures was included in operating expenses.
     SWL&P also offers electric and gas conservation programs to its Wisconsin 
customers in accord with Wisconsin state policies.

     Our nine largest customers, accounting for about 49% of electric operating 
revenue, are served under long-term contracts.

     The contracts, which in January 1995 averaged over six years in length, 
each require 10 megawatts or more of power and have termination dates from 
April 1997 to December 2005. Five of these customers are taconite producers and 
four are paper manufacturers.

forearm pain requiring treatment and physical therapy. He felt it was caused by 
strain from raking sludge off the walls of the plant's reclaim clarifier. After 
studying the problem, Brian and his colleagues decided to design an electric

     The contracts provide that, even at low electric usage levels, these 
customers will pay us enough to cover most of the fixed costs of having 
capacity available to serve them, including a return on equity.  The contracts 
require four years notice before they can be cancelled, although the rates paid 
under the contracts are subject to change through the regulatory process 
governing all retail electric rates. 
     In December 1994 Minnesota Power asked the MPUC to approve two additional 
rates for retail customers.  First, an economic development rate would give 
discounts to customers who invest in new capital improvements or equipment and 
increase electrical load on our system.  Second, an incremental sales rider to 
an existing contract would allow more flexibility for some customers to operate 
above their specified contract demand levels in certain months and pay only 
energy charges for the incremental load.
     For the next five years we are projecting relative stability in overall 
kilowatt-hour sales.  While taconite production in 1995 is expected to continue 
at near-record levels, the longer-term future of this cyclical industry is less 
certain.  While we are doing all we can to help all our taconite customers 
remain competitive, it is possible that production will decline gradually some 
time after the year 2000.

     Company generating stations in 1994 burned 3.4 million tons of coal, the 
cost of which is our largest operating expense.

     In December 1991 we paid Peabody Coal Company $35 million to terminate its 
long-term coal contract two years ahead of the scheduled termination date.  The 
cost was amortized monthly and collected from customers through a fuel 
adjustment provision until March 1994. Revenue collected this way amounted to 
$3.9 million in 1994, $18.5 million in 1993, and $14.5 million in 1992. Savings 
from the new coal supply agreements are being passed on to customers.
     In 1993 Minnesota Power entered into a contract with Peabody that extends
through May 1997 for up to two-thirds of our coal needs. The rest will be 
purchased on the spot market through one-year agreements, taking advantage of 
favorable market conditions. We are exploring supply options beyond 1997 that 
provide for a mix of long-, intermediate- and short-term purchases.  We believe
adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be 
available. 
     In February 1993 the Company renegotiated two contracts with Burlington 
Northern Railroad to deliver coal to our plants through December 2003 at 
reduced rates.  These new contracts also provide for better access to all major
coal production areas within the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming.

customers will substantially exceed the minimum contract amounts. In fact, 
assuming the new rates and large power contracts that are pending MPUC approval 
are put in place, annual minimum revenue will increase $16 
million to $28 million for each year through 1999.

     A lignite-fired minemouth power plant in North Dakota provides us with an 
economical supply of electricity.
     Under an agreement extending through 2007, the Company purchases 71% 
(about 307 megawatts during summer months and 322 megawatts during winter 
months) of the output of a mine-mouth generating unit owned by the Square Butte 
Electric Cooperative.  The Square Butte unit is one of two units at Minnkota 
Power Cooperative's Milton R. Young Generation Station near Center, N.D.
     Square Butte has the option, upon five years advance notice, to reduce our 
share of the unit's output to 49%. Minnesota Power has the option, though not 
the obligation, to continue to purchase 49% of the output at market-based 
prices after 2007 and through the end of the plant's economic life. Minnesota 
Power must pay any Square Butte costs and expenses that have not been paid by 
Square Butte when due, regardless of whether or not we receive any power from 
that unit.
     While many utilities and their customers will face higher costs to comply 
with clean-air legislation, we expect to meet future requirements without major 
spending.
     Burning low-sulfur fuels and equipped with pollution control equipment, 
our power plants already operate at or near the sulfur dioxide emission limits 
set for the year 2000 by the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. To meet 
nitrogen oxide emission limits for 2000, we expect to install new burner 
technology.  Total clean-air compliance costs cannot be accurately estimated 
yet, as regulations are not final.
     A settlement was reached in 1994 in an Environmental Protection Agency 
Superfund action to clean up pollution at a northern Minnesota oil refinery 
site.  Minnesota Power, along with roughly 130 other companies and several 
government entities, agreed on a $37 million proposal, which was submitted for 
approval to regulatory agencies. 
     Under the settlement, Minnesota Power's share of cleanup costs is about 
$314,000, all of which has been paid.  Other related legal and internal costs 
have totaled about $550,000 since 1990, when the suit was initiated. Cleanup is 
expected to begin in 1995.  Minnesota Power's electric utility is not the 
subject of any other environmental lawsuits.

     BNI Coal mined a record 4.4 million tons of lignite coal, produced its 
highest-ever net income of $3.1 million, and had no lost-time accidents in 
1994.
     Already North Dakota's lowest-cost producer of lignite - 24% less 
expensive than the next-lowest supplier in terms of cost per British thermal 
unit of energy in 1994 - BNI Coal should further increase its efficiency with 
the addition of $5 million in new scrapers and bulldozers in 1995. 
     BNI Coal's lignite is burned at the nearby Milton R. Young Station's two 
generating units.  Thanks largely to its economical coal supply, the Young 
plant in 1993, for the third consecutive year, achieved the second-lowest 
production cost of any power plant in the United States.  Its production cost 
of 10.33 mills per kilowatt-hour was more than 47% lower than the average for 
all coal-fired plants.
     BNI Coal's reserves exceed 500 million tons, leaving ample supply for 
expanded production if additional markets for lignite can be developed. This is 
a challenge because lignite's high moisture content hampers long-distance 
shipping. BNI Coal is working with Minnkota and other interested parties to 
upgrade the quality of the lignite through a process that reduces moisture and 
sulfur content.

BNI Cuts Haul Costs 20%

Minnesota Power's BNI Coal mine at Center, N.D., has replaced eight haul trucks 
of varying capacities and speeds with five new ones that perform the same job 
better. The Kress trucks, manufactured in Brimfield, Ill., carry 180 tons per 
trip, operating faster, safer, and with less driver fatigue. The bottom line, 
according to Pit Operations Manager Steve Hovey, who led the team that 
justified and planned the changeover, is a 20% cut in average haul costs.

WATER UTILITY OPERATIONS
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS

     Southern States Utilities, which serves about 149,000 customers, is 
Florida's largest privately held supplier of water and wastewater services, 
four times as large as any other independent water utility in the state. 

     As such, SSU represents part of the solution to Florida's historically 
fragmented water service, a welcome change in a state facing a serious 
collective water supply challenge. The company is working with Florida 
regulators and legislators to address concerns such as non-viable systems, 
environmental care and conservation.
     SSU has been granted cost-share funding from the South Florida Water 
Management District to build an aquifer storage and recovery facility to help 
meet long-term water needs of Marco Island, where the water supply is 
deteriorating due to intrusion of brackish sea water. This facility will allow 
SSU to store surplus fresh water in underground limestone formations until it 
is needed in high-demand winter months.  In addition, the Southwest Florida 
Water Management District granted SSU cost-share funding for a wastewater reuse 
project at our Spring Hill plant. 
     By concentrating on customer service, improved earnings, growth, working 
with regulators, and leadership in solving Florida's water supply problems, SSU 
demonstrates Minnesota Power's dedication to a long-term investment in water 
services that will benefit customers, employees, shareholders and the natural 
environment.

     With its service area gaining population at 3% a year, SSU sees 
opportunities for growth in its water business. 

     To stimulate internal growth, SSU encourages land developers to build 
within or adjacent to existing service areas. External growth is expected 
through further acquisitions and through offering management services to public 
utilities that prefer to own, but not operate, their systems.
     SSU continues to hold the line on expenses while adopting new measures to 
improve performance, concentrating on high standards of customer service, 
stewardship of water resources and the environment.
     Strategic planning initiatives include continuing employee training in new 
and evolving technology. Automation is helping increase productivity and 
customer service. Periodic research asks customers to evaluate company 
performance and guide SSU in making improvements.

     A new water testing laboratory at Deltona, Fla., scheduled for July 1995 
completion, will increase efficiency by centralizing most lab procedures, 
reducing costs and dependence on outside providers. It will assure that SSU's 
service meets or exceeds all state and federal water quality standards.
     SSU did not file a general rate case in 1994, but plans in 1995 to request 
an interim annual rate increase of about $10

Financial Health Counts, Too

When Sharon Aleck of our Heater Utilities affiliate saw an increase coming in 
Heater's group medical premiums, she did a little actuarial calculating. 
Finding that premiums had greatly exceeded claims in a recent period, Sharon 
started negotiating with the insurance company. The result: what might have 
been a $100,000-plus increase in annual premiums became an $18,000 decrease, 
even though the number of employees covered grew from 68 to 77.

million and could be seeking as much as $12 million in additional annual 
revenue in final rates. New facilities added since 1992 are not yet included in 
our rate base for earnings purposes. Further, mandated regulatory compliance 
cost increases during the same period, particularly for environmental 
protection, have raised operating expenses and should also be recovered in 
rates.
     Our 1995 filing will include innovations in rate design that will benefit 
both customers and shareholders.  In addition to the previously authorized 
uniform rates, we will propose before the Florida Public Service Commission 
(FPSC)  water conservation incentives and a consistent policy on charges for 
service availability.  These measures, coupled with continuing efforts to 
contain expenses, are expected to improve and provide more consistent earnings.

     SSU applies uniform rates in most of the areas it serves. This rate design 
policy, originally approved by the FPSC in 1993, was reaffirmed in August 1994. 

     Uniform rates recognize that SSU, operating as a statewide utility system, 
provides economical service to all customers, regardless of their location.  A 
uniform rate policy, applied today in many other states, also prevents "rate 
shock" by spreading the cost of capital improvements, reduces rate case 
preparation expenses, and can help promote water conservation. In a state 
facing a future water supply deficit, uniform rates represent sound public 
policy and a long-term benefit to customers and shareholders.
     By Florida law, water and wastewater utilities may make an annual index 
filing to recover inflation in system operation and maintenance expenses, thus 
delaying or avoiding the costs of full rate case filings. Similarly, another 
Florida law allows water and wastewater utilities to file annually to recover 
increased purchased water and wastewater treatment costs and property tax 
increases. Through these filings in 1993 and 1994, SSU requested $3 million in 
annual rate increases and was allowed $2.9 million.
     From 1992 through 1994 our Heater Utilities subsidiary has been granted 
annual water utility rate increases totaling $1.6 million of $2.4 million 
requested since 1991 from regulatory authorities in North Carolina and South 
Carolina. Rate decisions are expected by mid-1995 on additional requested rate 
increases totaling $334,000.  Heater is filing for rate increases affecting 
about 19,000 customers in North Carolina early in 1995.

     SSU's earnings reflected the sale of our water and wastewater facilities 
at Venice Gardens to Sarasota County for $37.6 million, resulting in a $19.1 
million gain.

     This sale was negotiated in anticipation of an eminent domain action by 
the County, which is purchasing private utilities in an effort to consolidate 
services.  Venice Gardens has about 15,500 customers.
     In October 1994 SSU requested approval from the FPSC to buy Orange Osceola 
Utilities, Inc. for about $13 million. Orange Osceola serves 17,000 customers 
in a 2,800-acre residential development near Kissimmee, Fla., close to Walt 
Disney World. SSU expects to conclude this acquisition in mid-1995.

1994 Financial Performance

     Above-normal rainfall in Florida and customer conservation curtailed water 
consumption in 1994, dampening anticipated returns from water utility 
operations.
     Although net income from continuing operations increased from 1993, it 
still fell short of authorized rates of return.  Narrowing the gap between 
actual and allowed earnings is a continuing challenge.  Without the gain from 
the sale of the Venice Gardens facilities, SSU's return on equity in 1994 would 
have been 2.8%.
     In contrast to Florida's heavy rainfall, 1994 was a dry year in the 
Carolinas, helping Heater Utilities achieve an 8.6% average return on equity. 
Heater recorded about 5% growth in its overall customer base, which included 
7.5% growth in the Raleigh-Durham area.
     Heater may lose 3,300 customers in an eminent domain action begun in 
January 1995 for its Seabrook, S.C., assets.  The price Heater will receive 
will be determined by court proceedings.

1994 rainfall was 41% above average in the Orlando area, decreasing water 
consumption and lowering SSU revenue. Authorities cautioned, however, that this 
temporary replenishment of the Florida aquifer does not reduce the need for 
continuing water management, conservation and action to address the sources of 
the state's long-term water deficit.

Works Better, Costs Less

Treatment of drinking water distributed by SSU includes adding a trace of 
chlorine. When the Florida Department of Environmental Protection ordered 
utilities to install chlorination alarms on unattended water facilities, Rich 
Sullo, who works at SSU's Deltona Lakes Plant, had a better idea. He designed 
an alarm system that assures proper chlorination and, if there's a problem, 
shuts down the well and electronically notifies the main plant. This saves time 
and water while maintaining quality standards. Commercially available alarms 
monitor chlorine levels but lack the shutdown feature and cost three times as 
much.

Comparing Financial Results from 1994, 1993 and 1992

     The sale of Venice Gardens assets contributed a $19.1 million gain to 
water utility operations revenue and income.  Operating revenue increased 
slightly due to new rates.  Consumption levels in 1994 were 8% lower than 1993, 
reflecting abnormally high rainfall in Florida during most of the last half of 
the year.
     SSU and Heater had combined net income of $13.3 million in 1994, $1.4 
million in 1993 and a net loss of $2.3 million in 1992.  The revenue from water 
and wastewater treatment services increased approximately 8% in 1993 because of 
higher water rates that have become effective at various dates since June 1992.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE SERVICES
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

     For many years non-utility investments have contributed substantially to 
Minnesota Power earnings.  Their mission is twofold:
     .    To achieve a higher rate of return on investments than we are 
limited to in the regulated sectors of our business; and,
     .    To keep funds available for reinvestment in existing businesses or 
the acquisition of new businesses.

     Over the past decade, our securities investment portfolio has contributed 
more than $150 million in earnings. However, its contributions declined 
significantly in 1994.

     Reflecting the volatility of financial markets during the year, some of 
the stocks in the portfolio declined in value. A more disturbing development, 
however, was a $10.1 million, or 21-cent-per-share write-off of one specific 
investment. The investment had been designed to protect the Company against 
fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility, but we believe the fund 
manager failed to follow the stated investment strategy and exposed the fund to 
rising interest rates.

     Investments and Corporate Services also includes our investment in Capital 
Re Corp., a leading U.S. reinsurer of municipal bonds and other financial 
guarantees. 

     While this firm primarily focuses on municipal bonds, it also reinsures 
non-municipal debt obligations and private mortgages. 
     Primary insurance companies buy reinsurance from Capital Re to guarantee 
the timely payment of principal and interest on investment-quality debt. Bonds 
reinsured by Capital Re automatically receive an upgrade to a AAA credit 
rating, which lowers the issuers' interest costs and provides an additional 
level of comfort to investors. Minnesota Power owns 21% of Capital Re and 
appoints two members of its board of directors.

     Minnesota Power also owns 80% of Lehigh Acquisition Corp., which has 
contributed substantially to our earnings in recent years.

     Its real estate properties include 8,100 undeveloped home sites and an 
additional 5,000 acres of unimproved property near and in the community of 
Lehigh Acres, which is about 15 miles east of Fort Myers, Fla.
     During the year, the community was enhanced by the opening of Lehigh 
Senior High School on a site largely donated by the company. A massive new Wal-
Mart Center, roughly three times the size of a typical Wal-Mart outlet, is 
under construction at a site near where Lehigh owns most of the remaining 
commercially zoned land. A new medical center has also opened, and Lehigh 
continues to recruit businesses for the community's industrial park.
     Lehigh sells properties to certified developers who build and sell well-
designed, affordable homes.
     Because Lehigh Acres is primarily an affordable first home and retirement 
community, growth is partly driven by the ability of retirees in the Midwest 
and Northeast to sell their existing homes. Rising economies in those areas 
should boost sales. Also, with the introduction of direct flights from Germany 
to Florida, Lehigh Acres is becoming a flourishing German community, complete 
with German restaurants and newspapers, and German-speaking customer service 
personnel.
     In 1994 Lehigh formalized procedures to begin constructing $5.2 million in 
water and wastewater facilities in Lehigh Acres using funds held in escrow. The 
funds are restricted for payment of such construction expenditures.  Based on 
revised procedures, which accelerated use of the funds, and plans to build the 
facilities over the next five years, Lehigh recognized approximately $4.5 
million of income in March 1994.  The Company's share of this income totaled 
$3.6 million.
     Lehigh, which contributed $10.2 million to corporate earnings in 1994, 
continues to be highly profitable for Minnesota Power. The plan is to sell the 
Lehigh property as opportunities arise. We anticipate the sales will be 
completed over the next five years.
     Income could receive a boost in 1995 from real estate-related tax benefits 
that came with Minnesota Power's purchase of Lehigh Corp. in 1991.  The 
benefits are recorded on Lehigh's books as $26.9 million of net deferred tax 
assets, offset by a reserve.  In keeping with established accounting 
principles, management reviews the assets quarterly; when it's deemed "more 
likely than not" that any portion of them will be realized, that portion will 
be recognized as income and the reserve reduced accordingly.  A portion of the 
assets may be recognized as income in 1995 as Lehigh reviews its business plan, 
including the timing and sale of its real estate holdings.

     Lake Superior Paper Industries, jointly owned by subsidiaries of Pentair, 
Inc. and Minnesota Power, rebounded in fourth quarter 1994 from the weak prices 
of recent years. 
     Demand for its supercalendered groundwood paper is at a historical peak.  
Economic recovery in Europe aided LSPI's turnaround by providing a market for 
Finnish paper that had in recent years been shipped to the United States, 
depressing prices here.
     LSPI production for the year reached the record level of 241,000 tons, 
exceeding the mill's designed capacity. Productivity outpaced all competing 
supercalendered paper machines and resulted in the company's being named the 
world's most efficient SCA mill. The eight-year-old mill achieved this without 
investing additional capital. Breakthroughs came about as a result of empowered 
employees continually finding better, more efficient ways of getting things 
done.
     LSPI should be able to capitalize on the favorable paper market industry 
experts project to continue through at least 1996.  No new paper-making 
machines are scheduled to begin operations in that time period, and paper 
prices have increased by 14 percent since September 1994.  LSPI's goals are to 
continually improve productivity and to further reduce costs while providing 
high-quality customer service.
     When we decided to go into the joint venture that led to the start-up of 
LSPI, our goals were to create jobs, gain a new industrial customer for our 
electric utility business, launch a business with expansion potential, and earn 
a profit on our investment.  These goals have largely been achieved. The plant 
provides more than 300 jobs in the mill plus another 300 in logging and 
trucking. It requires 48 megawatts of power.
     Therefore, should a favorable opportunity arise through our joint venture 
partner's pursuit of a sale of its interest in LSPI, Minnesota Power would 
consider a sale of its interest.  Among factors that would influence us in 
favor of a sale would be the expectation that the new owner would ultimately 
expand the mill to its full potential.
     If LSPI is sold, the deal might also include the sale of Superior Recycled 
Fiber Industries, the pulp production plant that is adjacent to and operated by 
LSPI.
     SRFI produces recycled pulp from office scrap paper.  Commercial 
operations began at SRFI in November 1993.  It produced 84,000 tons of recycled 
pulp and contributed $906,000 to Minnesota Power earnings in 1994.

As expected, demand for recycled paper gathered further momentum during the 
year, and this in turn spurred intense production efforts at SRFI. 

     The $78 million plant produces high-quality recycled pulp for making 
printing papers, such as Potlatch Corporation's Quintessence RemarqueTM used in 
this report.
     SRFI's production rate at the end of 1994 exceeded the plant's designed 
capacity of 247 tons per day. The demand for recycled pulp will likely continue 
to rise as federal agency requirements for copying paper containing at least

Improving Customer Service Spawns a New Business

"Know thy customer" is good advice for any business, and technology is helping 
us do this. In 1989 we formed a team to evaluate potential new customer 
information computer programs for our utility businesses. None of the available 
options satisfied the standards set by our team, so they designed their own 
system. After four years of hard work, Minnesota Power's Customer Information 
System is not only on-line and performing well, it is being profitably licensed 
to other companies around the world. Pictured, from left:  Mike Cochran, Mary 
Schoenrock, JoLynn Nilson, Karla Strombeck, Russ Schumacher, and Diane Stuart

20% post-consumer waste take effect. SRFI's production is virtually sold out 
through 1995.
     SRFI's goal is to increase production further by eliminating bottlenecks 
and further improving efficiency.
     The chief challenge to further expansion of SRFI's business is the 
procurement of scrap paper. SRFI recycles nearly 10% of all office scrap paper 
collected in the United States. Although office sector sources are reasonably 
well developed, at least half of all scrap paper suitable for recycling is in 
private homes and no systematic means of recapturing it exists at this time.

Baffling the Bubbles

At the front end of LSPI's paper machine, there's a large cylindrical tank 
called a Deculator, where air bubbles are removed from water that carries pulp 
into the machine. Too many bubbles cause defects in the paper. Bubbles and 
turbulence problems had been increasing last year as LSPI sped up the machine. 
So LSPI's Dave Evens built a plastic replica of the Deculator to learn what was 
causing the excess turbulence, then designed modifying baffles to correct the 
problem. Now the machine runs faster, LSPI is saving $35,000 a year on 
defoaming additives, and the Finnish manufacturer of the Deculator is paying 
our mill an annual royalty on the improvement: U.S. Patent No. 5,236,475.

Comparing Financial Results from 1994, 1993 and 1992

     Income from the Company's investments declined $19.7 million in 1994 
primarily due to unfavorable conditions in the securities markets and a 21-
cent-per-share write-off of the Company's $10.1 million investment in Granite 
Partners, a limited partnership that filed for bankruptcy protection in 1994.  
Capital Re contributed positively all three years.  Investments and reinsurance 
income was $13.4 million lower in 1993 than in 1992, reflecting the adoption of 
new accounting principles, lower returns due to market conditions, and a $5.1 
million gain from the redemption by the issuer of a preferred stock investment 
in 1992.
     Investment income includes revenue of $31.7 million in 1994, $31 million 
in 1993, and $28.7 million in 1992 from operations and the sale of certain 
assets by Lehigh.
     In December 1992, $15.5 million of debt issued for the purchase of the 
real estate properties and operations was extinguished, and Lehigh assumed some 
contingent liabilities for which it had previously been indemnified by the 
previous owner. This transaction resulted in a non-taxable extraordinary gain 
to Lehigh of approximately $7.2 million. The Company's two-thirds share of this 
gain contributed 16 cents to earnings per share in 1992. 
     LSPI returned to profitability in 1994, earning $3.1 million pre-tax, 
compared with a pre-tax loss of $3.7 million in 1993 and pre-tax income of $3.4 
million in 1992.  LSPI had total sales of $152 million in 1994, $143 million in 
1993, and $150 million in 1992.  The mill shipped 241,000 tons of paper in 
1994, compared with 235,000 tons in 1993, and 220,000 tons in 1992. The 
Company's share of LSPI's pre-tax income was $1.5 million in 1994, compared 
with a $1.8 million pre-tax loss in 1993, and $1.7 million pre-tax income in 
1992.
     The Company has an 82.5% ownership interest in Reach All, a manufacturer 
of specialized truck-mounted lifting equipment used by utilities and 
governmental entities. The Company recognized Reach All pre-tax losses of $5.2 
million in 1994, $764,000 in 1993, and $3.1 million in 1992.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

     As detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows from 
operating activities in 1994 were affected by a number of factors 
representative of normal operations.
     The Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
(DRIP) was amended in January 1993 to allow the DRIP to meet its needs by 
purchasing original-issue common shares from the Company or buying common 
shares on the open market.  The DRIP has been buying on the open market since 
January 1994.
     In 1994 SSU sold $10.3 million of inter-local tax-exempt bonds to finance 
several water projects in Florida.  The bonds carry a variable interest rate 
currently at 3 1/2%. A portion of the proceeds from the Venice Gardens utility 
sale was used to redeem SSU's $15 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 15 1/2% 
Series due 1994.

     The Company estimates its capital requirements through 2000 will be met 
primarily with internally generated funds. 

     Working capital, if and when needed, generally is provided by the sale of 
commercial paper. In addition, securities investments can be liquidated to 
provide funds for reinvestment in existing businesses or acquisition of new 
businesses, and approximately 900,000 original-issue shares of common stock are 
available for issuance through the DRIP. If the ADESA transaction is approved 
by ADESA shareholders, cash from the liquidation of investments is expected to 
be used for the $167 million purchase.
     The Company is committed to guarantee a portion of LSPI's lease obligation 
to a maximum of $95 million and expects that short-term loans to LSPI will 
fluctuate during 1995 but may approximate the $35 million note receivable 
outstanding as of Dec. 31, 1994.
     Minnesota Power's electric utility first mortgage bonds and secured 
pollution control bonds are currently rated the following investment grades:  
A2 by Moody's Investor Service, A- by Standard & Poor's, and A by Duff & 
Phelps. The disclosure of these security ratings is not a recommendation to 
buy, sell or hold the Company's securities.

     In 1994 capital expenditures in our electric business consisted of routine 
plant improvements and upgrades. Our power supply and projected demand are in 
balance.

     No new power plants or major changes to existing plants are expected in 
the 1995-2009 period.  Future water utility capital expenditures include 
facility upgrades to meet environmental standards and new water and wastewater 
treatment facilities to accommodate customer growth.
     Consolidated capital expenditures in 1994 totaled $81 million, including 
$45 million for the electric utility operations, $28 million for the water 
utility operations, $3 mil-

The Value of Safety

Lehigh Acquisition Corporation, our Florida real estate affiliate, employs 
people in building trades, site preparation, road construction and other jobs 
considered high-risk by insurers. Determined to do something about accidents 
and high workers' compensation premiums, Lehigh's Joan Adler designed a safety 
incentive program that slashed accident rates, lowered premiums, and garnered a 
premium refund of $99,116 in 1994. Another refund is expected in '95.

lion for the pulp production plant, and $5 million for an affordable housing 
project. Internally generated funds were used for capital expenditures for the 
electric business. Water utility and affordable housing capital expenditures 
were funded through long-term financing and with inter-
nally generated funds. 
     Capital expenditures are expected to be $65 million in 1995 and total 
about $232 million for 1996 through 1999.  The 1995 amount includes $30 million 
for routine electric capital expenditures, $26 million for upgrades, water 
reuse projects and new water facilities, and $9 million for coal mining 
equipment and other capital expenditures. The Company expects to finance the 
majority of its capital expenditures with internally generated funds.

     We increased our common dividend in January 1995, the 25th consecutive 
annual increase.

     In 1994 the Company paid out 98% of its per-share earnings in dividends.  
Given the lack of major construction needs and the liquidity of our securities 
investment portfolio, we do not believe this high payout ratio to be 
detrimental in the short run.  
     Over the longer term, Minnesota Power's goal is to reduce dividend payout 
to 70% of earnings.  We expect to do this by increasing earnings rather than 
reducing dividends.  Our goal is for earnings per share to grow from their 1994 
level of $2.06 to a minimum of $3.25 by the year 2000. Our corporate strategic 
plan calls for about one-third of earnings to come from electric utility 
operations, another third from water utility operations, and the remainder from 
our Investments and Corporate Services area.

Board of Directors of Minnesota Power

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the 
related consolidated statements of income, of retained earnings and of cash 
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
Minnesota Power and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these 
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting 
for income taxes and the employee stock ownership plan as discussed in Notes 13 
and 15, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.

Management

     The consolidated financial statements and other financial information were 
prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and 
objectivity. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated utilities and 
necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and best 
estimates of management.
     To meet its responsibilities with respect to financial information, 
management maintains and enforces a system of internal accounting controls 
designed to provide assurance, on a cost effective basis, that transactions are 
carried out in accordance with management's authorizations and that assets are 
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. The system 
includes an organizational structure which provides an appropriate segregation 
of responsibilities, careful selection and training of personnel, written 
policies and procedures, and periodic reviews by the internal audit department. 
In addition, the Company has a personnel policy which requires all employees to 
maintain a high standard of ethical conduct. Management believes the system is 
effective and provides reasonable assurance that all transactions are properly 
recorded and have been executed in accordance with management's authorization. 
Management modifies and improves its system of internal accounting controls in 
response to changes in business conditions. The Company's internal audit staff 
is charged with the responsibility for determining compliance with Company 
procedures.
     Five directors of the Company, not members of management, serve as the 
Audit Committee. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, oversees 
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee 
meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent 
accountants to discuss auditing and financial matters and to assure that each 
is carrying out its responsibilities. The internal auditors and the independent 
accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee without management 
present.
     Price Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants, is engaged to express an 
opinion on the financial statements. Their audit is conducted in accordance 
with generally accepted auditing standards and includes a review of internal 
controls and a test of transactions to the extent necessary to allow them to 
report on the fairness of the operating results and financial condition of the 
Company.

2    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     System of Accounts. The accounting records of Minnesota Power are 
maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
     Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements 
include the accounts of the Company and all of its majority owned subsidiary 
companies. All material intercompany balances and transactions between 
subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The prior years 
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to present comparable 
information for all years.
     Plant and Depreciation. Plant is recorded at original cost. The cost of 
additions to plant and replacement of retirement units of property are 
capitalized. Maintenance costs and replacements of minor items of property are 
charged to expense as incurred. Costs of depreciable units of plant retired are 
eliminated from the plant accounts. Such costs plus removal expenses less 
salvage are charged to accumulated depreciation. Plant stated on the balance 
sheet includes construction work in progress and is net of accumulated 
depreciation. (See note 1.)
     Various pollution abatement facilities are leased from municipalities 
which have issued pollution control revenue bonds to finance the cost of the 
facilities. The cost of the facilities and the related debt obligation, which 
is guaranteed by the Company, has been recorded as electric plant and long-term 
debt, respectively.
     Depreciation of utility plant is computed using rates based on estimated 
useful lives of the various classes of property. Provisions for book 
depreciation of the average original cost of depreciable property approximated 
3% in 1994, 2.9% in 1993 and 2.7% in 1992. In 1995 the Company will begin 
recovering through rates approved by the MPUC in November 1994 approximately 
$1.3 million each year to pay for decommissioning of coal-fired power plants.
     Contributions in aid of construction (CIAC), recorded at estimated 
original cost, relate to water and wastewater plant contributed to the Company 
by developers and customers. CIAC is amortized on the straight-line method over 
the estimated life of the asset to which it relates when placed in service. 
Amortization of CIAC reduces depreciation expense.
     The Company's water plant includes plant held for future use which 
consists primarily of distribution and collection systems that will be placed 
in service as additional customers are connected to the systems. These systems 
are not depreciated until placed in service. The Company had $34.9 and $35.2 
million of plant held for future use at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993. CIAC funded 
approximately $21 million of plant held for future use in 1994 and 1993.
     Fuel, Material and Supplies. Fuel, materials and supplies are stated at 
the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.
     Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. The Company is subject to the 
provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of 
Regulation." The Company capitalizes as deferred regulatory charges incurred 
costs which are expected to be recovered in future utility rates. Deferred 
regulatory credits represent amounts expected to be credited to customers in 
rates. (See note 3.)
     Revenue and Income Recognition.
     Electric Utility Operations. The Company files for periodic rate revisions 
with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
The MPUC had regulatory authority over approximately 77% in 1994, 76% in 1993 
and 79% in 1992 of the Company's total electric utility operations revenue. 
Interim rates in Minnesota are placed into effect, subject to refund with 
interest, pending a final decision by the MPUC.
     Customer meters are read and bills are rendered on a cycle basis. Revenue 
is accrued for service provided but not yet billed. The service rates of the 
Company to all classes of customers include fuel adjustment clauses under which 
fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the base levels in rate 
schedules are billed or credited to customers. In addition, billings to retail 
electric customers reflect an annual billing adjustment mechanism applied 
monthly for recovery of CIP expenditures.
     During 1994, 1993 and 1992, revenue derived from one major customer was 
$60.2, $59.6 and $57.8 million, respectively. Revenue derived from another 
major customer was $45.3, $45 and $47 million, respectively.
     Water Utility Operations. The Company provides water service to 
communities in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Water 
rates are under the jurisdiction of various state and county regulatory 
authorities. Billings are rendered on a cycle basis. Revenue is accrued for 
water sold but not billed.
     Investments and Corporate Services. Investments and corporate services 
includes revenue from the sale of pulp and real estate, and income from 
securities investments. Pulp and real estate revenue is recognized on the 
accrual basis. Securities investments are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 
115, adopted on Dec. 31, 1993. (See note 4.)
     Income Taxes. Investment tax credits for utility property are amortized 
over the service life of the related property. Deferred taxes are provided on 
temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
which will have a future impact on taxable income.
     Unamortized Expense, Discount and Premium on Debt. Expense, discount and 
premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related 
issues.
     Statement of Cash Flows. The Company considers all investments purchased 
with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
     Noncash financing activities in 1994, 1993 and 1992 included $3.6, $3.7 
and $2.7 million, respectively, relating to debt service on the ESOP promissory 
note and the ESOP debt guaranteed by the Company. (See note 15.) Other noncash 
financing activities in 1993 included the issuance of 140,648 shares of common 
stock, with a market value at the time of issuance of approximately $4.9 
million, in exchange for an additional 13.4% ownership interest in Lehigh.

3    Regulatory Matters
     Electric Utility Rate Proceedings. In January 1994 the Company filed with 
the MPUC a request for a final annual rate increase from all retail electric 
customers of $34 million, or 11.8%, and a 12.5% return on equity. In August 
1994 the Company reduced its requested annual increase of $34 million to $27 
million for 1994 and $23 million for 1995 because of reductions in the 
projected cost of service and the addition of long-term contract commitments by 
a taconite customer. On Feb. 17, 1994, the MPUC voted to approve the Company's 
requested annual interim rate increase of $20 million, or 7%. This interim rate 
increase began on March 1, 1994, subject to refund with interest, and will 
continue until final rates are effective. 
     In November 1994, the MPUC granted the Company an increase in annual 
electric operating revenue of $19 million and an 11.6% return on equity. Rates 
for large industrial customers will increase less than 4%, while the rate for 
small businesses will increase 6.5%. The rate increase for residential 
customers will be phased in over three years: 13.5% beginning in 1995, 3.75% in 
January 1996 and another 3.75% in January 1997. In 1994 the Company collected 
$17.2 million of interim revenue subject to refund with interest. The Company 
has reserved $6.1 million of the interim revenue for anticipated refunds. Final 
rates are expected to be effective in the second quarter of 1995.
     In January 1994 the Company began recovering ongoing 1994 CIP expenditures 
and $8.2 million of deferred CIP expenditures incurred prior to Dec. 31, 1993, 
through an annual billing adjustment mechanism approved by the MPUC. Through 
the adjustment the Company is allowed to recover current and deferred CIP 
expenditures and a lost margin associated with power saved as a result of these 
programs. The adjustment is revised annually to reflect CIP expenditures that 
differ from the base level included in the rate schedules. The Company 
collected $7.8 million of CIP related revenue in 1994.
     Water Utility Rate Proceedings. In 1993 the FPSC and certain Florida 
counties approved final annual rate increases totaling $16 million of $21.2 
million requested by SSU. The FPSC ordered uniform rates for 90 water and 37 
wastewater systems in SSU's 1992 consolidated rate filing in Florida. Uniform 
rates are based on companywide costs rather than costs related to individual 
systems. In 1993 the FPSC initiated a separate investigation to determine if, 
as a matter of policy, uniform rates are appropriate for Florida water 
utilities. In August 1994 the FPSC reaffirmed the appropriateness of the 
uniform rate structure.
     Under Florida law, water and wastewater utilities may make an annual index 
filing designed to recover inflationary costs associated with operation and 
maintenance expenses. The law's intent is to provide inflationary relief to 
utilities, thus delaying or avoiding the costs associated with full rate case 
filings. Under another Florida law, water and wastewater utilities may make an 
annual pass-through filing to recover increased purchased water and wastewater 
treatment costs and property tax increases. The FPSC approved annual rate 
increases totaling $2.9 million of the $3 million requested in SSU's 1993 and 
1994 index filings and 1994 pass-through filings.
     Peabody Contract Buyout. In 1991 Minnesota Power and Peabody Coal Company 
(Peabody) executed an agreement to terminate the 1968 Coal Supply Contract 
between the parties (the Coal Contract) two years ahead of the scheduled 
termination date.
     In accordance with orders issued by the MPUC and the FERC, the Company 
used the retail and resale fuel adjustment clauses to pass through to electric 
customers the $35 million charge (plus a return on the funds used to make the 
payment) paid by the Company in December 1991 to terminate the Coal Contract. 
The early termination allowed the Company to purchase lower-priced coal on the 
open market and eliminated all of the Company's future responsibility relating 
to the Coal Contract. The impact of this ratemaking treatment on the 
consolidated income statement was the recognition of $3.9, $18.5, and $14.5 
million in 1994, 1993, and 1992 of the Coal Contract termination costs as fuel 
expense and the recovery of these costs in revenue through the fuel adjustment 
clauses.
     Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. Based on current rate treatment, 
the Company believes it will continue to recover from ratepayers all deferred 
regulatory charges.

4    Financial Instruments
     Securities Investments. The majority of the Company's securities 
investments are investment-grade stocks of other utility companies and are 
considered by the Company to be conservative investments. 
     The Company classifies its investments in equity and debt securities in 
three categories: Trading securities are those bought and held principally for 
near-term sale. They are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as part of 
current assets, with changes in fair value during the period included in 
earnings. Held-to-maturity securities are those the Company has the ability and 
intent to hold to maturity. They are recorded at amortized cost in investments 
and corporate services on the balance sheet. Available-for-sale securities are 
those that do not fit either of the previous two categories. They are recorded 
at fair value in investments and corporate services on the balance sheet. 
Changes in fair value during the period are recorded net of tax as a separate 
component of common stock equity. If the fair value of any available-for-sale 
or held-to-maturity securities declines below cost and the decline is 
considered other than temporary, the securities are written down to fair value 
and the losses charged to earnings. Realized gains and losses are computed on 
each specific investment sold.

</TABLE>
     Off-Balance-Sheet Risks. In portfolio strategies designed to reduce market 
risks, the Company sells common stock securities short and enters into short 
sales of treasury futures contracts.
     Selling common stock securities short is intended to reduce market price 
risks associated with holding common stock securities in the Company's trading 
securities portfolio. Transactions involving short sales of common stock are 
completed on average within 90 days from when the transactions were entered 
into. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from short sales of common stock 
securities are included in investment income.
     Treasury futures are used as a cross hedge to reduce interest rate risks 
associated with holding fixed dividend preferred stocks included in the 
Company's available-for-sale portfolio. Changes in market values of treasury 
futures are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
underlying hedged item. Gains and losses on treasury futures are deferred and 
recognized in investment income concurrently with gains and losses arising from 
the underlying hedged item. Generally, treasury futures contracts entered into 
have a maturity date of 90 days.
     In 1994 SSU entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement to 
lower its overall cost of borrowing. SSU agreed with a counterparty to 
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and 
floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional principal 
amount. The differential paid or received is accrued and recognized as 
adjustments to interest expense. The interest rate swap is subject to market 
risk as interest rates fluctuate.
     The notional amounts summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged 
and are not a measure of the Company's financial exposure. The amounts 
exchanged are calculated on the basis of these notional amounts and other terms 
which relate to the change in interest rates and securities prices. The Company 
continually evaluates the credit standing of counterparties and market 
conditions with respect to its off-balance-sheet financial instruments. The 
Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations or 
any material adverse impact to its financial position from these financial 
instruments.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying amount of cash and cash 
equivalents, trading securities, notes and other accounts receivable, and notes 
payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those 
instruments. The Company records its trading and available-for-sale securities 
at fair value based on quoted market prices. The fair values for all other 
financial instruments were based on quoted market prices for the same or 
similar issues.

     Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that subject the 
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade and other 
receivables. The Company sells electricity to about 17 customers in northern 
Minnesota's taconite and paper industries. At Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, 
receivables from these customers totaled $8.5 and $7.6 million. The Company 
sells recycled pulp to about 20 paper manufacturers that are geographically 
dispersed. At Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, receivables from these customers totaled 
$13.5 and $3.6 million. The Company does not obtain collateral to support 
receivables, but monitors the credit standing of major customers. The Company 
has not incurred and does not expect to incur significant credit losses.

5    Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates
     Capital Re Corporation. The Company has an equity ownership investment in 
Capital Re, a company engaged in financial guaranty reinsurance. In 1994 the 
Company purchased an additional 417,100 shares of Capital Re common stock for 
$8.8 million, which increased its ownership interest to 21.4%. The Company 
accounts for this investment under the equity method.

     Lake Superior Paper Industries. The Company is an equal participant with 
Pentair Duluth Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pentair, Inc., in LSPI, a 
joint venture supercalendered paper mill in Duluth, Minn.
     LSPI is obligated for approximately $33.4 million of annual lease payments 
for a 25-year operating lease extending to 2012 for paper mill equipment. LSPI 
sold the paper mill equipment in a sale-leaseback transaction at a gain that is 
being amortized over the lease term.
     The Company is required to contribute capital to LSPI of at least $16 
million in the form of equity or debt. As of Dec. 31, 1994, the Company had

     In 1993 the Company changed the method of accounting for its ESOP. Under 
the new method, the difference between the market value of the shares committed 
to be released from collateral when earned and the cost of the shares to the 
ESOP is recorded in common stock equity. (See note 15.)
     In September 1993 the Company issued one million shares of new common 
stock in a public offering for $34.6 million. The net proceeds were used to 
fund a portion of the Company's investment in SRFI and for other corporate 
purposes. 
     In June 1993 the Company issued 140,648 shares of new common stock with a 
market value at the time of issuance of approximately $4.9 million in exchange 
for an additional 13.4% ownership interest in Lehigh.
     In January 1993 the Company amended its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment 
and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP). The amendment gave the Company the option to 
issue new common stock shares or continue to purchase shares on the open market 
for the DRIP. At Dec. 31, 1994, the Company had 912,281 shares of common stock 
authorized to be issued pursuant to the DRIP.

9    Short-Term Borrowings and Compensating Balances
     The Company had bank lines of credit, which make short-term financing 
available through short-term bank loans and provide support for commercial 
paper, aggregating approximately $72 million at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993. At Dec. 
31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had issued commercial paper with face values of 
$54 and $20 million, respectively, supported by bank lines of credit and 
liquidity provided by the Company's securities portfolio. Certain lines of 
credit require payment of a 1/8 of 1% commitment fee and others require 
maintenance of 5% compensating balances. Interest rates on commercial paper and 
borrowings under the lines of credit range from 5.5% to 9.5% at Dec. 31, 1994, 
and 3.5% to 7.5% at Dec. 31, 1993. The weighted average interest rate on short-
term borrowings at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, was 5.7% and 3.5%. The total amount 
of compensating balances at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, was immaterial.

10   Square Butte
     Purchased Power Contract
     Under the terms of a 30-year contract with Square Butte that extends 
through 2007, the Company is purchasing 71% of the output from a mine-mouth, 
lignite-fired generating plant capable of generating up to 455 megawatts. This 
generating unit (Project) is located near Center, N.D. Reductions to about 49% 
of the output are provided for in the contract and, at the option of Square 
Butte, could begin after a five-year advance notice to the Company and continue 
for the remaining economic life of the Project. The Company has the option but 
not the obligation to continue to purchase 49% of the output after 2007.
     The Project is leased to Square Butte through Dec. 31, 2007, by certain 
banks and their affiliates which have beneficial ownership in the Project. 
Square Butte has options to renew the lease after 2007 for essentially the 
entire remaining economic life of the Project.
     The Company is obligated to pay Square Butte all Square Butte's leasing, 
operating and debt service costs (less any amounts collected from the sale of 
power or energy to others) that shall not have been paid by Square Butte when 
due. These costs include the price of lignite coal purchased by Square Butte 
under a cost-plus contract with BNI Coal. The Company's cost of power and 
energy purchased from Square Butte during 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $55.4, $56.5 
and $54.1 million, respectively. The leasing costs of Square Butte included in 
the cost of power delivered to the Company totaled $19.3 million in 1994, $19.7 
million in 1993 and $19.6 million in 1992, which included approximately $12, 
$12.5 and $12.9 million, respectively, of interest expense. The annual fixed 
lease obligations of the Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1995 
through 1999. At Dec. 31, 1994, Square Butte had total debt outstanding of $219 
million. The Company's obligation is absolute and unconditional whether or not 
any power is actually delivered to the Company.
     The Company's payments to Square Butte for power and energy are approved 
as purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and the 
FERC.
     One principal reason the Company entered into the agreement with Square 
Butte was to obtain a power supply for large industrial customers. Present 
electric service contracts with these customers require payment of minimum 
monthly demand charges that cover most of the fixed costs associated with 
having capacity available to serve them. These contracts minimize the negative 
impact on earnings that could result from significant reductions in kilowatt-
hour sales to industrial customers. The minimum contract term for the large 
industrial customers is 10 years, with a four-year cancellation notice required 
for termination of the contract at or beyond the end of the 10th year. Under 
terms of existing contracts, the Company would collect approximately $90.5, 
$78.1, $75.5, $61.5 and $32.3 million under current rate levels for firm power 
during the years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, even if no 
power or energy were supplied to these customers after Dec. 31, 1994. However, 
following implementation of rate increases approved by the MPUC in November 
1994, and the anticipated MPUC approval of pending contract amendments, this 
minimum contract revenue is expected to increase $16 to $28 million in each 
year. The minimum contract provisions are expressed in megawatts of demand, and 
if rates change, the amounts the Company would collect under the contracts will 
change in proportion to the change in the demand rate.

11    Jointly Owned Electric Facility
     The Company owns 80% of Boswell Unit 4. While the Company operates the 
plant, certain decisions with respect to the operations of Boswell Unit 4 are 
subject to the oversight of a committee on which the Company and Wisconsin 
Public Power, Inc. SYSTEM (WPPI), the owner of the other 20% of Boswell Unit 4, 
have equal representation and voting rights. Each owner must provide its own 
financing and is obligated to pay its ownership share of operating costs. The 
Company's share of direct operating expenses of Boswell Unit 4 is included in 
the corresponding operating expense on the consolidated statement of income. 
The Company's 80% share of the original cost recorded in plant in service at 
Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, was $306 million. The corresponding provisions for 
accumulated depreciation were $119 and $111 million.

12   Sale of Water Plant Assets
     In December 1994 SSU sold all of the assets of its Venice Gardens water 
and wastewater utilities to Sarasota County in Florida, (the County) for $37.6 
million. The sale increased 1994 net income by $11.8 million and contributed 42 
cents to 1994 earnings per share. Water utility operations on the consolidated 
statement of income includes a pre-tax gain of $19.1 million from the sale. 
This sale was negotiated in anticipation of an eminent domain action by the 
County, which is purchasing private utilities in an effort to consolidate 
services.

     Adoption of SFAS 109. The Company adopted SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income 
Taxes" on a prospective basis in January 1993. The adoption of SFAS 109 changed 
the Company's method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method 
(Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11) to an asset and liability 
approach. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 109, the Company had deferred the tax 
effects of timing differences between income for financial reporting purposes 
and taxable income. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
(book value) and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.

     At Dec. 31, 1994, approximately $26.9 million of net deferred tax assets 
resulting from the original purchase of Lehigh are included on the Company's 
balance sheet. These assets are fully offset by the deferred asset valuation 
allowance because under the standards of SFAS 109 it is currently "more likely 
than not" that the value of these assets will not be realized. Management 
reviews the appropriateness of the valuation allowance quarterly. A reduction 
in the valuation allowance will result in recognition of income during the 
respective period.
     A provision has not been made for taxes on $19.1 million of undistributed 
earnings which were earned prior to 1993 by Capital Re, an investment accounted 
for under the equity method. Those earnings have been and are expected to 
continue to be reinvested. The Company estimates that $7.9 million of tax would 
be payable on the pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re if the Company 
should sell its investment. The Company has recognized the income tax impact on 
undistributed earnings of Capital Re earned since Jan. 1, 1993.

14   Pension Plans and Benefits
     Pension Plans. The Company's Minnesota, Wisconsin and Florida utility 
operations have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible 
employees. Pension benefits for employees in Minnesota and Wisconsin are fully 
vested after five years and are based on years of service and the highest 
average monthly compensation earned during four consecutive years within the 
last 15 years of employment. Employees in Florida are fully vested after five 
years of credited service, with benefits based on years of service and average 
earnings. Company policy is to fund accrued pension costs, including 
amortization of past service costs over 5 to 30 years. Part of pension cost is 
capitalized as a cost of plant construction.

     Postretirement Benefits. The Company provides certain health care and life 
insurance benefits for retired employees. SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," adopted Jan. 1, 1993, changed the 
Company's method of accounting for these costs requiring that they be 
recognized during employment. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 106, the Company 
recognized these costs as they were paid. Postretirement benefit costs 
recognized in 1992 under the Company's prior accounting method were $918,000.
     As of Dec. 31, 1994, the Company has deferred $12.8 million of 
postretirement benefit costs in excess of those allowed in existing rates. 
Pursuant to a rate order issued by the MPUC in November 1994, the Company will 
recover in electric rates, the retail portion ($11.7 million) of these deferred 
costs over a five year period beginning in 1995.

     Company policy is to fund the net periodic postretirement costs and the 
amortization of the costs deferred as the amounts are collected in rates. The 
Company will fund these benefits using Voluntary Employee Benefit Association 
(VEBA) trusts and an irrevocable grantor trust. The Company will make the 
maximum tax deductible contributions to the VEBAs. The remainder of the funds 
will be placed in the irrevocable grantor trust until the funds can be used to 
make tax deductible contributions to the VEBAs. The funds in the irrevocable 
grantor trust do not qualify as plan assets for purposes of SFAS 106.

     For measurement purposes, it was assumed per capita health care benefit 
costs would increase 13.3% in 1994 and that cost increases would thereafter 
decrease 1% each year until stabilizing at 5.3% in 2002. Accelerating the rate 
of assumed health care cost increases by 1% each year would raise the 1994 
transition obligation by $8.1 million and service and interest costs by a total 
of $1.4 million. The weighted average discount rate used in estimating 
accumulated postretirement benefit obligations was 8.25% for 1994 and 7% for 
1993. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.75% for 1994 
and 8.5% for 1993.

     Postemployment Benefits. The Company provides certain postemployment 
benefits to employees and their dependents during the time period following 
employment but before retirement. On Jan. 1, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS 
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which recognizes the 
estimated future cost of providing postemployment benefits on an accrual basis 
over the active service life of employees. Adoption of SFAS 112 resulted in a 
$2.2 million transition obligation. As a result of a rate order issued by the 
MPUC in November 1994, the Company deferred $1.6 million of the transition 
obligation which is being recovered in electric rates over a three year period 
beginning in 1994. Prior to the 1994 adoption of SFAS 112, the Company 
recognized postemployment benefit expenses as they were paid.

15   Employee Stock Plans
     Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The Company has sponsored an ESOP since 
1975, amending it in 1989 and 1990 to establish two leveraged accounts.
     The 1989 leveraged ESOP account covers all non-union Minnesota and 
Wisconsin employees who work more than 1,000 hours per year and have one year 
of service. The ESOP used the proceeds from a $16.5 million, 15-year loan at 
9.125%, guaranteed by the Company, to purchase 633,489 shares of Minnesota 
Power common stock on the open market in early 1990. These shares fund employee 
benefits totaling not less than 2% of the participants' salaries.
     The 1990 leveraged ESOP account covers Minnesota and Wisconsin employees 
who participated in the non-leveraged ESOP plan prior to Aug. 4, 1989. The ESOP 
issued a $75 million promissory note at 10.25% with a term not to exceed 25 
years to the Company (Employer Loan) as consideration for 2.8 million shares of 
newly issued Minnesota Power common stock in November 1990. These shares are 
used to fund a benefit at least equal to the value of the following: (a) 
dividends on shares held in participants' 1990 leveraged ESOP accounts which 
are used to make loan payments, and (b) the tax savings generated from 
deducting all dividends paid on shares currently in the ESOP which were held by 
the plan on Aug. 4, 1989.
     The loans will be repaid with dividends received by the ESOP and with 
employer contributions. ESOP shares acquired with the loans were initially 
pledged as collateral for the loans. The ESOP shares are released from 
collateral and allocated to participants based on the portion of total debt 
service paid in the year.
     The Company accounts for the ESOP in accordance with the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position 93-6 
(SOP 93-6).
     The adoption in 1993 of SOP 93-6 decreased 1993 net income by $5.2 million 
and reduced the average number of shares outstanding for the 1993 EPS 
calculation by 3,114,067 shares. The net impact was a 6 cent increase in 1993 
earnings per share.
     Prior to 1993, the Company accounted for the ESOP in accordance with AICPA 
Statement of Position 76-3. ESOP loans, the note receivable and unallocated 
ESOP shares pledged as collateral for the loans were recorded in the financial 
statements the same as under SOP 93-6. All ESOP shares were treated as 
outstanding. The Company recognized interest income and interest expense on the 
Employer Loan to the ESOP in the financial statements. The Company calculated 
interest and compensation expense by first reducing interest expense and then 
compensation expense by the amount of dividends paid on leveraged shares 
charged to retained earnings. Compensation expense was computed using the cost 
basis to the ESOP of the shares. In 1992, the Company realized $3.2 million in 
tax benefits from the deduction of dividends paid on the unallocated shares 
used to make the debt service payments. These tax benefits were recorded 
directly to retained earnings and included in the EPS computation. Under SOP 
93-6, these tax benefits are included in income tax expense.
