                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE which are made in this Form 8-K, in presentations,  in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond the control of ALLETE and may cause actual results to
differ  materially  from  those  contained  in  forward-looking   statements:

    -   prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those
        of the United States Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal Energy
        Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,  the
        Florida  Public  Service   Commission,   the  North  Carolina  Utilities
        Commission,  the Public  Service  Commission  of  Wisconsin  and various
        county  regulators,  about  allowed  rates of return,  industry and rate
        structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, operation
        and  construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and
        capital  investments,  and present or  prospective  wholesale and retail
        competition (including but not limited to transmission costs);

    -   economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

    -   changes  in and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws  and
        policies;

    -   weather conditions;

    -   population growth rates and demographic patterns;

    -   competition for retail and wholesale customers;

    -   pricing and transportation of commodities;

    -   market demand, including structural market changes;

    -   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

    -   changes in project costs;

    -   unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

    -   capital market conditions;

    -   competition for new energy development opportunities; and

    -   legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal) and
        settlements that influence the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                  ALLETE REPORTS SOLID SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS
                  --------------------------------------------

ALLETE,  Inc. (NYSE:  ALE) today reported earnings of 57 cents per share for the
second  quarter  of 2001,  a 19  percent  increase  over a year ago.  The stated
increase  excludes a gain of 44 cents per share  from the sale of the  company's
investment  in ACE Limited  last year.  Quarterly  revenue  was $443.0  million,
compared  to $327.0  million in 2000.  This 35  percent  increase  reflects  the
success of  ALLETE's  growth  initiatives.  The  second  quarter  results  bring
year-to-date  earnings  to $1.03  per  share,  13  percent  ahead of last  year,
excluding  ACE.  ALLETE  remains  on track to  achieve  its target of 12 percent
annual earnings growth for 2001.

"Being a  diversified  company,  we're not  dependent  on a single  business  to
deliver value to our shareholders,"  said Ed Russell,  ALLETE President and CEO.
"Our strong  second  quarter is a clear  example of this  strategy at work,  and
we're delighted with the results."

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES net income  climbed 37 percent for the quarter,  42 percent
year-to-date,  which is in line with  expectations  set for 2001.  ADESA vehicle
sales for the quarter  rose 60 percent  over a year ago,  due  primarily  to the
addition of 28 vehicle auctions.  At Automotive Finance Corporation,  the number
of vehicles financed grew by 15 percent.

ALLETE's  INVESTMENTS  portfolio  recorded a 70 percent  increase in net income,
boosted by a $29 million  real estate  sale at Cape Coral,  Florida,  along with
strong sales at other Florida locations.  Year-to-date,  Investments contributed
$22.8  million,  compared to $21.7  million,  illustrating  the strength of this
segment.

     ENERGY SERVICES net income for the quarter was up modestly compared to last
year,  despite  approximately  $1.3  million in  additional  costs  incurred  by
Minnesota  Power caused by a severe  April ice storm and wind damage.  Even with
these  unexpected  costs,  year-to-date  net income is up by 7 percent over last
year.

WATER SERVICES net income declined slightly in the quarter, due in large part to
a  9  percent   decrease  in  water   consumption   primarily   attributable  to
above-average rainfall in Florida.  Customer growth, however, climbed a robust 7
percent compared to a year ago.

ALLETE is a  multi-services  company  with  corporate  headquarters  in  Duluth,
Minnesota.  ALLETE's holdings include the  second-largest  wholesale  automobile
auction  network in North  America;  the leading  provider of  independent  auto
dealer  inventory  financing;  the largest  investor-owned  water  utilities  in
Florida and North Carolina;  significant real estate holdings in Florida;  and a
low-cost electric utility that serves some of the largest  industrial  customers
in the United States.
