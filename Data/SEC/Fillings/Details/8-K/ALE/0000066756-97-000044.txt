Item 5.  Other Events.

FPSC Refund Order in Connection with 1991 Rate Case.
     On June 17,  1997 the Florida  First  District  Court of Appeals  (Court of
Appeals)  filed a decision  reversing the Florida  Public  Service  Commission's
(FPSC) August 1996 order (Refund  Order) which directed  Florida Water Services
Corporation (Florida Water) to refund approximately $15 million,  which includes
interest, to customers who paid more since October 1993 under uniform rates than
they would have paid under  stand-alone  rates.  The Refund Order did not permit
Florida Water to surcharge  those  customers who paid less under uniform  rates.
With "uniform rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the same rates
for  water  and  wastewater  services.  Uniform  rates  are  an  alternative  to
"stand-alone"  rates  which are  calculated  based on the cost of  serving  each
service  area. No provision for refund was or has been recorded in connection
with the $15 million refund.
     The Court of Appeals  determined that the FPSC's order directing the refund
without  permitting a related  surcharge was not permissible  because it did not
comport  with  principles  of  equity or with  existing  Florida  Supreme  Court
precedent.  The  Court  of  Appeals  remanded  the  matter  back to the FPSC for
reconsideration,  and  directed the FPSC to consider  requests for  intervention
from the various customer groups impacted by any potential  surcharges.  Parties
to the appeal may  request a rehearing  of the Court of  Appeals'  June 17, 1997
decision or petition for review by the Florida Supreme Court.

Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case.
     Effective  June  13,  1997  Florida  Water  began  collecting  pre-existing
Allowance  for Funds  Prudently  Invested  (AFPI)  charges,  pending  appeal and
subject to refund.  AFPI  represents  the accrued  carrying cost of non-used and
useful property excluded from rate base and is collected as a one-time charge to
certain new water and wastewater customers.
     The recovery of AFPI charges at certain  Florida  Water's service areas was
reduced  or  eliminated  in the  FPSC's  October  1996  final  order  issued  in
connection with Florida  Water's 1995 rate case. In April 1997 the FPSC,  acting
on Florida Water's  motion,  allowed  recovery of pre-existing  AFPI charges for
these service areas,  subject to refund with interest in the event of an adverse
court  ruling in the  appeal  of the 1995 rate  case.  Florida  Water  estimates
approximately  $1 million,  on an annual basis,  will be collected and accounted
for as deferred  revenue pending results of the appeal.  The appeal process may
take as long as two years.

Hernando County Rates.
     On April 14, 1997  Florida  Water filed for a rate change with the Hernando
County Board of  Commissioners.  Florida Water filed for an annual  interim rate
reduction of $258,780  (-3.3 percent) and a final rate increase of $123,897 (1.6
percent).  On June 14,  1997 the final rate  increase  Florida  Water  requested
became  effective  automatically  by  operation of law because  Hernando  County
failed to take action on the rates within the prescribed  statutory period.  The
rate increase is subject to refund.

     On June 17, 1997  Hernando  County voted to issue a cease and desist order,
and to file a circuit court action  against  Florida Water seeking to enjoin the
implementation  of the rate increase.  The Company  believes  Hernando  County's
actions are not  supported  by Florida law. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of this matter.
