ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December
31, 1998 of Minnesota Power, Inc.  (Minnesota Power) for background  information
on the following  update.


Ref. 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 Page 19. - Sixth Paragraph
Ref. 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 Page 20. - Fourth Paragraph

On December 16, 1999 the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) closed its
investigation   into  the   reasonableness   of  Minnesota  Power's  rates.  The
investigation  was opened by the MPUC in June 1999. In early  September 1999 the
MPUC clarified that the  investigation  was preliminary in nature.  On September
29,  1999  Minnesota  Power  filed its report  explaining  1998  actual and 1999
projected  earnings,  along with an explanation of why rates continue to be just
and reasonable.

The Minnesota  Department  of Commerce  (Department)  recommended  acceptance of
Minnesota Power's September 1999 filing and closure of the investigation without
any further action. On a 3-0 vote, the MPUC closed its preliminary investigation
and determined it would not commence a full-scale rate investigation.
