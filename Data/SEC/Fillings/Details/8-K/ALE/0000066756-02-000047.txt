           PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER
       REGARDING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO EXCHANGE ACT FILINGS


I, David G. Gartzke, state and attest that:

(1)  To  the  best of my knowledge, based upon a review  of  the covered reports
     of ALLETE,  Inc.,  and, except as corrected or supplemented in a subsequent
     covered report:

        - no covered report  contained an untrue  statement of  a  material
          fact as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the
          case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the
          date on which it was filed); and

        - no covered report omitted to state  a material fact necessary to
          make the statements in the covered report, in light of the
          circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the end
          of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on
          Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was
          filed).

(2)  I have  reviewed the contents of this  statement  with  ALLETE's  audit
     committee.

(3)  In this statement under oath, each of the following, if filed on or before
     the date of this statement, is a "covered report":

        - Annual  Report  on Form 10-K for  the  year  ended  December 31, 2001
          of  ALLETE;

        - all reports on Form 10-Q, all reports on Form  8-K and all
          definitive proxy materials of ALLETE filed with the Commission
          subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K identified above; and

        - any amendments to any of the foregoing.



                                            Subscribed and sworn to
                                            before me this 5th day of
