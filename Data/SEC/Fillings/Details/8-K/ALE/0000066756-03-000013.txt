                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this Form 8-K, in presentations, in response to questions or
otherwise.   Any  statements  that  express,   or  involve  discussions  as  to,
expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions  or  future  events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"projects,"  "will likely result," "will continue" or similar  expressions)  are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

  -  war and acts of terrorism;

  -  prevailing  governmental  policies and regulatory  actions, including those
     of the United  States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal  Energy
     Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission,  the
     Florida Public Service Commission, the North Carolina Utilities Commission,
     the Public Service  Commission of Wisconsin and various county  regulators,
     about allowed  rates of return,  financings,  industry and rate  structure,
     acquisition   and  disposal  of  assets  and   facilities,   operation  and
     construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital
     investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail  competition
     (including  but not  limited  to  transmission  costs)  as well as  general
     vehicle-related laws, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws;

  -  unanticipated impacts of restructuring initiatives in the electric
     industry;

  -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

  -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;

  -  weather conditions;

  -  market factors affecting supply and demand for used vehicles;

  -  wholesale power market conditions;

  -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;

  -  the  effects  of  competition,  including  the  competition for  retail and
     wholesale customers, as well as suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;

  -  pricing and transportation of commodities;

  -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

  -  unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;

  -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

  -  capital market conditions;

  -  competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;

  -  ALLETE's ability to manage expansion and integrate recent acquisitions; and

  -  the outcome  of  legal and  administrative  proceedings (whether  civil  or
     criminal) and  settlements  that affect the business and  profitability  of
     ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                 ALLETE REPORTS 2002 EARNINGS, 2003 EXPECTATIONS
                 -----------------------------------------------

     (Duluth, Minn.)-ALLETE, Inc. (NYSE: ALE) today reported 2002 earnings of
$1.68 per share, compared with earnings of $1.81 in 2001. Excluding one-time
events, earnings were $1.80 per share in 2002 and $1.87 in 2001. Net income was
$137.2 million in 2002 on revenue of $1.507 billion, compared with $138.7
million net income on revenue of $1.526 billion in 2001.

"We navigated through a challenging year while accomplishing several important
goals," said Dave Gartzke, ALLETE's chairman, president and CEO. "We simplified
our company by exiting non-strategic businesses. This strengthened our balance
sheet and allowed us to focus on our two core businesses. We continued our
efforts to communicate this new focus to investors."

One-time events in 2002 include final exit charges related to the automotive
transport and Electric Odyssey retail businesses, as well as a charge related to
the indefinite delay of an electric generation project in Superior, Wis. In
2001, ALLETE recognized a portion of the exit charge from the automotive
transport business.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES grew net income by 24% in 2002 despite relatively flat
auction vehicle sales. At ADESA, growth was due to mandated goodwill accounting
changes, lower interest expense and increased auction efficiency. Automotive
Finance Corporation financed 42,000 more vehicles - an increase of 5%.

At ENERGY SERVICES, total kilowatt-hour sales were up 11% for the year in part
due to sales from nonregulated generation that began in 2002. Low wholesale
prices, however, resulted in net income declining by 8%, excluding the Superior
generation project.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES declined by $19.5 million from 2001, mainly
due to the liquidation of the company's securities portfolio during the year and
the largest real estate sale in the company's history which improved earnings in
2001.

Net income from DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS increased by $9.8 million in 2002,
largely from the suspension of depreciation expense at the company's Water
Services businesses. The pending sale of Florida Water Services for $492.5
million is expected to close in mid-February.

"The proceeds from the sale will give us the ability to reduce debt, which will
further strengthen our balance sheet and keep us financially well-positioned,"
Gartzke said. "Our two core businesses remain strong and are poised for earnings
growth in their respective markets as economic conditions improve."

Gartzke expects earnings at Automotive Services to grow by about 15% in 2003.
Earnings at Energy Services are expected to decrease slightly from 2002 levels.
"If wholesale power prices improve, so too will our profitability at Energy
Services," he added.

ALLETE's corporate headquarters are located in Duluth, Minnesota. ALLETE's
holdings include ADESA, the second largest wholesale vehicle auction network in
North America; AFC, the leading provider of independent auto dealer financing;
Minnesota Power, a low-cost electric utility that serves some of the largest
industrial customers in the United States; and significant real estate holdings
in Florida. For more information about ALLETE, visit the company's Web site at
