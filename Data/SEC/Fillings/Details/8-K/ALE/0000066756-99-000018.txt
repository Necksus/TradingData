ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

Reference is made to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December
31, 1998 (1998 Form 10-K) of Minnesota Power, Inc.  (Minnesota Power or Company)
for background  information on the following  update.  The cited reference is to
the Company's 1998 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 22 - Fifth and Six Paragraphs.
Ref. Form 8-K dated and filed February 26, 1999.

On May 27, 1999  Minnesota  Power  announced that it will exchange its shares of
common  stock in Capital Re  Corporation  (Capital Re) for shares of ACE Limited
(ACE).  Minnesota Power has been one of Capital Re's largest  shareholders since
its initial  investment  in December  1987.  Capital Re is a financial  guaranty
reinsurance  and specialty  insurance  company that trades on the New York Stock
Exchange  under the symbol KRE. ACE through its  subsidiaries,  provides a broad
range of insurance and reinsurance products for a diverse group of international
clients. ACE trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ACL.

On May 27, 1999  Capital Re and ACE executed a letter of intent  providing  that
ACE will  acquire all of the  outstanding  capital  stock of Capital Re in a tax
deferred exchange. Under the terms of the letter, Capital Re's shareholders will
receive 0.6 shares of ACE for each share of Capital Re at closing,  subject to a
maximum value to Capital Re shareholders of $22 per share.  Minnesota Power owns
7.3 million  shares,  or 23 percent,  of Capital Re stock,  which equates to
approximately  4.4 million  registered  shares,  or 2 percent,  of ACE stock.
Based on the market  closing price of ACE's shares on May 26, 1999,  the
exchange  transaction  would  value  Capital Re at $606  million,  or $18.90 per
share.  The  transaction  is  subject  to  definitive  documentation,  customary
regulatory  approvals,  approval by Capital Re's shareholders and ACE's Board of
Directors, confirmation of the outstanding financial strength ratings of Capital
Re's principal operating subsidiaries and other customary conditions.  Minnesota
Power has agreed to vote its shares in favor of the  exchange.  Minnesota  Power
has also  agreed to hold its  shares of ACE for a period of 180 days  commencing
the day of closing,  other than in a single private sale of all or substantially
all of the original shares  Minnesota Power will receive.  In addition,  ACE and
Capital  Re  have  agreed  to a $25  million  no-shop  fee.  Capital  Re and ACE
anticipate signing a definitive agreement on or before June 9, 1999.

Minnesota  Power has accounted for its investment in Capital Re using the equity
method. The current carrying value of the Company's equity investment in Capital
Re is $138 million.  Until presented with the opportunity to join ACE, Minnesota
Power had no intent to sell its shares of Capital Re stock.  Existing accounting
rules require the Company to recognize a one-time,  non-cash  charge to earnings
of approximately $15 million during the second quarter of 1999 due to the change
in the Company's  intent to hold this  investment  long term. The charge relates
primarily to the provision for deferred taxes on the  undistributed  earnings of
Capital Re.  Upon  closing,  which is  expected to occur later this year,  final
transaction valuation will occur.

This exchange has significant  advantages for Minnesota  Power. ACE is a larger,
more diversified  company than Capital Re with a market  capitalization  of $6.2
billion and sales of $1.5 billion for the 12 months  ended March 31,  1999.  The
investment will provide Minnesota Power with greater financial liquidity to fund
future growth initiatives in its core businesses.

In conjunction  with its  announcement of the ACE  transaction,  Capital Re also
announced  a  reinsurance  exposure of  approximately  $67 million due to assets
which may be  missing  from  International  Financial  Services  Life  Insurance
Company.  At the  present  time,  Capital  Re is  unable  to  estimate  any loss
associated with this exposure or when or how extensive any recovery may be.
