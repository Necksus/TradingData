                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this Form 8-K, in presentations, in response to questions or
otherwise.   Any  statements  that  express,   or  involve  discussions  as  to,
expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions  or  future  events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"projects,"  "will likely result," "will continue" or similar  expressions)  are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

 -   war and acts of terrorism;
 -   prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of
     the  United  States  Congress,  state  legislatures,   the  Federal  Energy
     Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission,  the
     Florida Public Service Commission, the North Carolina Utilities Commission,
     the Public Service  Commission of Wisconsin and various county  regulators,
     about allowed  rates of return,  financings,  industry and rate  structure,
     acquisition   and  disposal  of  assets  and   facilities,   operation  and
     construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital
     investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail  competition
     (including  but not  limited  to  transmission  costs)  as well as  general
     vehicle-related laws, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws;
 -   unanticipated impacts of restructuring initiatives in the electric
     industry;
 -   economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;
 -   changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;
 -   weather conditions;
 -   natural disasters;
 -   market factors affecting supply and demand for used vehicles;
 -   wholesale power market conditions;
 -   population growth rates and demographic patterns;
 -   the effects  of  competition, including  the  competition  for  retail  and
     wholesale customers, as well as suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;
 -   pricing and transportation of commodities;
 -   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
 -   unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;
 -   unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
 -   capital market conditions;
 -   competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;
 -   ALLETE's ability to manage expansion and integrate recent acquisitions; and
 -   the outcome  of  legal  and  administrative  proceedings (whether  civil or
     criminal) and  settlements  that affect the business and  profitability  of
     ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

     FLORIDA WATER SERVICES SALE UPDATE; ALLETE RE-AFFIRMS STRATEGIC REVIEW
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

(DULUTH, Minn.)-ALLETE, Inc. (NYSE:ALE) announced that a Florida court ruling,
issued today, will delay the sale of assets of its water services business,
Florida Water Services Corporation (Florida Water) to the Florida Water Services
Authority (FWSA). Florida Water is discussing with the FWSA means for continuing
to work together, while it considers possible transactions with other buyers.

"ALLETE will consider a broader range of strategic options with respect to our
water services businesses," said Dave Gartzke, ALLETE Chairman, President and
CEO. "Florida Water Services continues to be a valuable business, and our
objective is to maximize its value for the benefit of our shareholders."

Gartzke added that the court decision does not stop the strategic evaluation the
company is currently undertaking. In conjunction with its investment advisors,
the company is undertaking a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the benefits and
risks of separating its energy and automotive businesses into independent
companies. The company will seek to complete its analysis as soon as practicable
and will inform shareholders of its conclusion. If the decision is made to
proceed with a separation, public notice will be made at the appropriate time
through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a press release
and will include the steps it intends to follow and time frame for implementing
those steps. "Whatever the result of the analysis, we remain committed to the
fundamentals of operating performance and cash flow discipline for our
businesses," Gartzke said.

A shareholder proposal was submitted for consideration at ALLETE's 2003 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders asking shareholders to recommend that the separation of
the energy and automotive businesses be implemented. Because the company is in
the midst of a comprehensive review of this matter, the proponents led by Lafer
Equity Investors, L.P., and its affiliates have agreed to withdraw such
proposal.

ALLETE's corporate headquarters are located in Duluth, Minnesota. ALLETE's
holdings include ADESA, the second largest wholesale vehicle auction network in
North America; AFC, the leading provider of independent auto dealer financing;
Minnesota Power, a low-cost electric utility that serves some of the largest
industrial customers in the United States; and significant real estate holdings
in Florida. For more information about ALLETE, visit the company's Web site at
www.allete.com.

The statements contained in this release and statements that ALLETE may make
orally in connection with this release that are not historical facts, are
forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties and investors are directed to the risks
discussed in documents filed by ALLETE with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
