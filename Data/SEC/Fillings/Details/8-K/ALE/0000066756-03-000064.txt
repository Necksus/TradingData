                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this Form 8-K, in presentations, in response to questions or
otherwise.   Any  statements  that  express,   or  involve  discussions  as  to,
expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions  or  future  events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates,"   "believes,"   "estimates,"   "expects,"   "intends,"   "plans,"
"projects,"  "will likely result," "will continue" or similar  expressions)  are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

     - war and acts of terrorism;
     - prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those
       of the United States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the Federal Energy
       Regulatory  Commission,  the Minnesota Public Utilities  Commission,  the
       Florida  Public  Service   Commission,   the  North  Carolina   Utilities
       Commission, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and various county
       regulators, about allowed rates of return, financings,  industry and rate
       structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities,  operation
       and  construction  of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and
       capital  investments,  and present or  prospective  wholesale  and retail
       competition  (including but not limited to transmission costs) as well as
       general  vehicle-related  laws,  including  vehicle brokerage and auction
       laws;
     - unanticipated  impacts  of  restructuring  initiatives  in  the  electric
       industry;
     - economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;
     - changes  in  and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws  and
       policies;
     - weather conditions;
     - natural disasters;
     - market factors affecting supply and demand for used vehicles;
     - wholesale power market conditions;
     - population growth rates and demographic patterns;
     - the effects of  competition,  including  the  competition  for retail and
       wholesale customers, as well as suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;
     - pricing and transportation of commodities;
     - changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
     - unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;
     - unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
     - capital market conditions;
     - competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;
     - ALLETE's ability to manage  expansion and integrate recent  acquisitions;
       and
     - the outcome of legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or
       criminal) and settlements  that affect the business and  profitability of
       ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

NEWS

                  ALLETE REPORTS SOLID FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS

DULUTH, Minn.-ALLETE, Inc. (NYSE: ALE) today reported first quarter 2003
earnings of 54 cents per share, compared with 44 cents per share reported for
the first quarter a year ago. Net income was $44.3 million on revenue of $422.9
million compared with $35.2 million of net income on $368.3 million of revenue
in the first quarter of 2002.

"We are satisfied with the overall financial results for the quarter and are on
track to meet our total year expectations," said Dave Gartzke, ALLETE Chairman,
President and CEO.

Increased wholesale power sales and prices resulted in ENERGY SERVICES net
income of $12.2 million compared with $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2002.
AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES revenue climbed 12 percent and net income increased 7
percent in spite of difficult market conditions that resulted in flat sales
volume at ADESA auctions compared to last year.

In addition to net income from Water Services, this quarter's earnings from
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS included a $9.8 million after-tax gain on the
condemnation sale of a utility system at Amelia Island, Florida. This more than
offset $7.4 million of after-tax expenses associated with efforts to sell the
Water Services businesses. In 2002, Discontinued Operations included exit
charges of $2.3 million.

The company also announced that representatives of its subsidiary, Florida Water
Services Corporation, met on April 16, 2003 with leaders of local governments
that have expressed an interest in purchasing the assets of Florida Water that
serve their residents. The governmental entities at the meeting discussed
acquiring directly from Florida Water approximately two-thirds of Florida
Water's asset base. If it proceeds with this course of action, Florida Water
would seek to sell the remaining one-third of its assets to other interested
local governments, and the water systems not sold in this process would be sold
to a private buyer.

ALLETE's corporate headquarters are located in Duluth, Minnesota. ALLETE's
holdings include ADESA, the second largest wholesale vehicle auction network in
North America; AFC, the leading provider of independent auto dealer financing;
Minnesota Power, a low-cost electric utility that serves some of the largest
industrial customers in the United States; and significant real estate holdings
in Florida. For more information about ALLETE, visit the company's Web site at

ORALLY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS RELEASE THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS, ARE
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE
PROJECTED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND INVESTORS ARE DIRECTED TO THE RISKS
