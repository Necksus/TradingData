Item 5.  Other Events.

         On January 4, 1996, the Florida Public Service  Commission (FPSC) voted
4-1 to permit  Southern  States  Utilities  (SSU), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Minnesota  Power & Light  Company,  to implement an interim rate increase  which
would  result,  on an  annualized  basis,  in an  increase  of $7.9  million  in
authorized  revenue over revenue from rates currently in effect. SSU expects the
interim  rates to be  effective  by  February  1,  1996.  The  revenue  increase
represents 94 percent of the amount  required by SSU based on a 1994  historical
test year.

         SSU  originally  requested  interim  rates in an  annualized  amount of
approximately $12 million based on a 1995 forward-looking test year. However, by
order dated  November  1, 1995,  the FPSC  denied the  original  request for two
reasons:  (i) it was based on system-wide rates (which were deemed improper by a
court order subsequent to SSU's original filing),  and (ii) the FPSC had not yet
formulated a policy as to what types of investments  and expenses could properly
be included in a forward-looking interim test year.

         This interim rate action is taken in connection  with SSU's request for
an $18 million  final  revenue  increase  filed August 2, 1995.  Final rates are
anticipated to become effective in the fourth quarter of 1996.
