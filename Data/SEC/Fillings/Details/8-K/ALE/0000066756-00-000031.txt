ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

For background information on the following update, reference is made to page 12
of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 1999 and page
9 of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 of Minnesota Power, Inc.
(Minnesota Power or Company).

On June 27,  2000  ADESA  Corporation  (ADESA),  a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of
Minnesota Power, signed a letter of intent with Manheim Auctions, Inc. (Manheim)
to buy eight ADT  Automotive  Holdings,  Inc.'s  (ADT)  auctions and one Manheim
auction.  In January 2000 Manheim agreed to purchase 28 ADT auctions.  Following
Federal Trade  Commission (FTC) review of the Manheim/ADT  transaction,  Manheim
agreed to sell the nine auctions  ADESA intends to purchase.  The  ADESA/Manheim
transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive purchase
agreement,  completion of due diligence, Board approval, approval by the FTC and
satisfaction of various  other  customary  conditions.   The  Company  expects
to  finance  the transaction with long-term debt to be repaid over two to three
years.

The auctions included in the transaction are:  Southwest Auto Auction located in
Phoenix,   Arizona;  Golden  Gate  Auto  Auction  located  near  San  Francisco,
California;  Southern States Vehicle Auction located in metro Atlanta,  Georgia;
Metro Auto  Auction of Kansas City located  near Kansas  City,  Missouri;  Puget
Sound Auto Auction located in the Seattle,  Washington  area;  Colorado  Springs
Auto Auction  located in Colorado  Springs,  Colorado;  and three  Florida-based
auctions,   Bayside  Auto  Auction  in  Tampa,   Clearwater   Auto  Auction  and
Orlando-Sanford Vehicle Auction. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2000, these
nine auctions sold  approximately  400,000 vehicles and generated  approximately
$130  million in  revenue.  With this  purchase,  ADESA will  operate 55 vehicle
auction facilities throughout the United States and Canada.
