Item 5.  Other Events.

     On June 11, 1996 the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) voted 3-2 to
require Southern States Utilities, Inc. (SSU), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Minnesota Power & Light Company (Minnesota Power), to refund about $10 million,
including interest, to certain customers who had paid more to SSU under a 
uniform rate structure than they would have paid under a stand-alone rate 
structure during the period September 1993 to January 1996. The FPSC order 
reflecting this vote is expected by July 2, 1996. In so ruling, the majority of
the FPSC determined that a February 1996 decision of the Florida Supreme Court
in GTE Florida v. FPSC did not render a refund requirement unlawful. In March
1996, the FPSC had voted to reconsider its earlier order imposing the refund
requirement in light of the GTE Florida decision. SSU beleives that the GTE
Florida decision substantiates SSU's claim that it would be unlawful for the
FPSC to order a refund to certain customers who paid more under uniform rates
without also permitting SSU to recover the refund amount from remaining
customers who paid less. SSU has recorded no provision for refund. SSU intends
to appeal the FPSC's order to the First District Court of Appeals.
