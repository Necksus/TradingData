     2.6  Effect on Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the 
Merger and without any action on the part of any shareholder: 

          (a)  All shares of Common Stock owned by Sub or which are held by 
     ADESA as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be 
     cancelled, and no payment shall be made in respect of such shares.

          (b)  Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately 
     prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be 
     canceled in accordance with section 2.6(a)) shall be converted into the 
     right to receive $17.00 per share in cash ("Merger Price").

          (c)  Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and outstanding 
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one 
     validly issued fully paid and nonassessable common share of the Surviving 
     Corporation.

     2.7  Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares.

          (a)  Prior to the Closing Date, ADESA shall select a bank or trust 
     company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the 
     cash consideration specified in section 2.6(b) upon surrender of 
     certificates representing Common Stock converted into the right to receive 
     cash pursuant to the Merger.

          (b)  On the Closing Date the Surviving Corporation will provide to 
     the Paying Agent on a timely basis funds necessary to pay for the shares 
     of Common Stock pursuant to section 2.6(b).

                                   7

<PAGE>
          (c)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying 
     Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates 
     which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding 
     shares of Common Stock, other than Sub whose shares of Common Stock are to 
     be cancelled as provided in Section 2.6(a) (the "Certificates"), (i) a 
     letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be 
     effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only 
     upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such 
     form and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may 
     reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the 
     surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the amount of cash specified 
     in section 2.6(b).  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to 
     the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by 
     the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly 
     executed, and such other documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, 
     the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the 
     amount of cash into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore 
     represented by the Certificate so surrendered shall have been converted 
     pursuant to the provisions of section 2.6(b), and the Certificate so 
     surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  No interest will accrue or be 
     paid on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.  In the 
     event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock which is not registered 
     in the transfer records of the Surviving Corporation, a check in payment 
     of the proper amount of cash may be issued to a transferee if the 
     Certificate representing such Common Stock is presented to the Paying 
     Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such 
     transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have 
     been paid.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this section 2.7, each 
     Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to 
     represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash 
     specified in section 2.6(b).  Any funds deposited with the Paying Agent 
     that remain unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Surviving 
     Corporation for one year after the Effective Time shall be paid to the 
     Surviving Corporation upon demand and any former shareholders of the 
     Surviving Corporation who have not theretofore complied with the 
     instructions for exchanging their Certificates shall thereafter look only 
     to the Surviving Corporation for payment.

          (d)  No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock.  All cash paid 
     upon the surrender of shares of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation 
     in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in 
     full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Common Stock. 
     If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving 
     Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled as provided in this 
     Agreement.  

                                   8

<PAGE>
     2.8  Closing of the Surviving Corporation's Transfer Books.  At the 
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be 
closed and no transfer of shares of Common Stock (other than shares of Common 
Stock into which the capital stock of Sub is converted pursuant to the Merger) 
shall thereafter be made, except for shares issued pursuant to the Merger and 
transfers made pursuant to one or more of the Ancillary Agreements.

     2.9  Stock Options.  At the Effective Time, each then outstanding option 
(whether or not then exercisable) to purchase shares of Common Stock (a "Stock 
Option") granted under ADESA's 1992 Stock Option Plan ("Stock Option Plan") 
other than non-employee director Stock Options will expire by virtue of the 
Merger, as provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option 
Agreement pursuant to which such Stock Options were issued and by which they 
are governed, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or by ADESA, 
and each then outstanding non-employee director Stock Option (whether or not 
then exercisable) granted under the Stock Option Plan will be cancelled 
pursuant to the terms of termination agreements between ADESA and the non-
employee directors ("Stock Option Termination Agreements").  The Surviving 
Corporation shall pay each holder of any expired or cancelled Stock Options an 
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common 
Stock which the holder thereof would have been entitled to purchase pursuant to 
such holder's expired or cancelled Stock Options and (ii) the amount by which 
the Merger Price exceeds the exercise price per share pursuant to such expired 
or cancelled Stock Options.

duly organized and in existence under the laws of the State of Indiana, has all 
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its 
properties and assets and to conduct its business as now being conducted and is 
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in

40,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of

of Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid 
and nonassessable.  There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness 
having the right to vote on any matters on which ADESA's shareholders may vote 
("Voting Debt") issued or outstanding.  Except for existing outstanding Stock 
Options, there exists no subscription, option, warrant, call, conversion or 
other right, agreement or commitment of any character obligating ADESA, 
contingently or otherwise, to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock, or

convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of ADESA's capital stock.

listed in Schedule 3.3 attached hereto and made a part hereof.  Each ADESA 
Subsidiary is a corporation or limited liability company duly organized,

its incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate or other power 
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business 
as now being conducted and is duly qualified and in good standing in each 
jurisdiction in which the operation of its business or the ownership or leasing 
of its properties makes such qualification necessary, except for any failure to 
be so qualified which is not a Material Adverse Effect.  All of the outstanding 
shares of capital stock of each ADESA Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid 
and nonassessable and, except as disclosed in Schedule 3.3, are owned by and 
registered in the name of ADESA, free and clear of any Adverse Claims.  There 
are no existing options, calls, commitments or other agreements of any 
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities 
of any ADESA Subsidiary.  Except for the Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 3.3 to 
the Disclosure Statement, ADESA does not directly or indirectly own any equity 
interest in any other Person.

     3.4  Authority.  ADESA has all requisite corporate power and authority to 
enter into this Agreement and (subject to adoption of this Agreement by the 
Requisite Shareholder Approval) to consummate the transactions contemplated 
hereby.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by ADESA and (subject to 
Requisite Shareholder Approval) the consummation by ADESA of the transactions 
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action 
on the part of ADESA.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by 
ADESA and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of ADESA enforceable in 
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the 
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and the application of equitable 
principles in any action, legal or equitable.  Except for agreements between 
ADESA or any Subsidiary with the creditors named in section 8.2(e), the 
execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions 

                                   10

<PAGE>
hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with 
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of 
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a 
benefit under, any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of 
ADESA or any Subsidiary, or any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, 
indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, 
license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation 
applicable to ADESA or any Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, 
except for any conflict, violation, default, right or loss which is not a 
Material Adverse Effect.  No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or 
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required 
by or with respect to ADESA, any Subsidiary or Affiliate in connection with the 
execution and delivery of this Agreement by ADESA or the consummation by ADESA

as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby and (iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the

copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy 
statement filed by ADESA with the SEC since January 1, 1993 (the "SEC 
Documents"), which are all the documents (other than preliminary material) that 
ADESA was required to file with the SEC since said date.  As of their 
respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the 
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and none of 
the SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact required to 
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not 
misleading, except to the extent information contained in any SEC Document has 
been revised or superseded by a later-filed SEC Document.  The financial 
statements of ADESA included in the SEC Documents complied as to form in all 
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published 
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of the respective 
dates of the SEC Documents, and such financial statements, together with the 
audited financial statements of ADESA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 
1994 heretofore delivered to MPL (the "1994 Financial Statements"), have been 
prepared in 

                                   11

<PAGE>

consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the 
notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-
Q of the SEC) and fairly presented (subject, in the case of the unaudited 
statements, to customary year end audit and other adjustments and the addition 
of notes thereto) the consolidated financial position of ADESA and its 
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results 
of their operations and changes in financial position for the periods then 
ended.

in Schedule 3.7 attached hereto and made a part hereof, neither ADESA nor any 
Subsidiary is in violation of or default under any statute, law, ordinance, 
code, rule, regulation, judgment, order, decree, permit, concession, grant, 
franchise, license or other authorization, approval or requirement of any 
Governmental Entity applicable to any of them or any of their properties, 
except for any violation or default which is not a Material Adverse Effect.  
Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.7, neither ADESA nor any Subsidiary has 
received any citation or notice of violation of any federal, provincial, state 
or local statute, ordinance or regulation of any kind which is currently 
outstanding nor has ADESA or any Subsidiary been so noticed or cited in the 
last year.  ADESA and each Subsidiary has all private and Governmental Entity 
permits, concessions, grants, qualifications, franchises, licenses and other 
authorizations and approvals necessary for the conduct of their respective 
businesses and all of the foregoing have been duly obtained and are in full 
force and effect, and there are no proceedings pending, or to ADESA's knowledge 
threatened, which may result in the revocation, cancellation, suspension or 
adverse modification of any thereof, except for the failure to hold any such 
permit, concession, grant, qualification, franchise, license, authorization and 
approval which is not a Material Adverse Effect.

     3.8  Liabilities.  Except as described in Schedule 3.8 annexed hereto and 
made a part hereof or as reflected or reserved against in, or disclosed in the 
footnotes to, the 1994 Financial Statements, on the date of the 1994 Financial

liabilities or obligations (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a 
nature required by generally accepted accounting principles to be recognized or 
disclosed in such consolidated financial statements of ADESA and its 
Subsidiaries.

     3.9  Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Except as disclosed in 
Schedule 3.9 attached hereto and made a part hereof, since December 31, 1994,

Agreement, ADESA has not experienced or suffered any Material Adverse Effect 
and, except as disclosed in Schedule 3.9, there has not been (i) any

the compensation payable or to become payable by ADESA or any Subsidiary to 
their officers or key employees, or any material increase in any bonus,

any such officers or key employees, except for increases in the ordinary

exclusive of shares voted by Interested Shareholders, without regard to the 
necessity of a quorum in respect thereof (collectively the "Requisite 
Shareholder Approval").

event that either (A) the board of directors of ADESA (and the special 
committee thereof) does not receive a satisfactory update of the fairness 
opinions heretofore delivered to the board of directors of ADESA (and the

financial advisors, which updates are anticipated to occur on or about the date 
of the definitive Merger Proxy Statement, or (B) either of such fairness 
opinions is withdrawn, and (ii) shall be suspended if the board of directors of 
ADESA (or the special committee thereof) determines in the exercise of their 
fiduciary duties to entertain, negotiate or participate in any other

in any such other Acquisition (and shall terminate if such other Acquisition is 
completed).

which such counsel are admitted to practice, such counsel may rely upon the 
opinion of local counsel of established reputation reasonably acceptable to MPL 
and its counsel.

     6.9  Opinion of Counsel for MPL and Sub.  At the Closing MPL and Sub 
shall cause its counsel, Briggs and Morgan, to deliver to ADESA and the

          (i)  MPL is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in 
     good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota, Sub is a 
     corporation duly organized and in existence under the laws of the State of

          (ii)  Each of MPL and Sub has all requisite corporate power and 
     authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions 
     contemplated by this Agreement; the execution and delivery by MPL and Sub 
     of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which either of them is

<PAGE>
     each of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which either MPL or 
     Sub is a party has been duly executed and delivered by MPL or Sub, as the 
     case may be, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of MPL and 
     Sub, as the case may be, enforceable in accordance with their respective 
     terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, 
     reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement 
     of credits' rights generally and the application of equitable principles 
     in any action, legal or equitable; and

          (iii)  Any consent, approval, order or authorization of, and any 
     waiting period (including the HSR Waiting Period) imposed by, any 
     Governmental Entity, which is required by or with respect to MPL or Sub in 
     connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by MPL and 
     Sub or the consummation by MPL and Sub of the transactions contemplated 
     hereby, has been obtained or, in the case of any such waiting period, has 
     expired.

federal law of the United States, or the laws of such jurisdictions in which 
such counsel to MPL and Sub are admitted to practice, such counsel may rely 
upon the opinion of local counsel of established reputation reasonably 
acceptable to ADESA and its counsel.

     during regular business hours upon reasonable notice, to all of its

     such reasonable inspections as it may require, and (iii) cause its 
     officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish MPL with such financial 
     and operating data and other information with respect to the business and 
     properties of ADESA and the Subsidiaries as any of the foregoing may be 
     necessary for MPL to complete its due diligence.

          (b)  All non-public information concerning the business operations 
     and affairs of ADESA, heretofore or hereafter obtained by MPL pursuant to 
     this section 6.11 shall be treated as confidential (subject to applicable 
     legal requirements) and shall be subject to the provisions of the 
     confidentiality 

                                   26

<PAGE>
     agreement between MPL and ADESA dated June 20, 1994, which 
     agreement remains in full force and effect, except insofar as such 
     provisions would expressly prohibit MPL or Sub from taking any of the 
     actions expressly contemplated by this Agreement.  MPL's obligations 
     hereunder and under the confidentiality agreement shall terminate at the 
     Effective Time.

     6.12 Best Efforts.  Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its best 
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all necessary or appropriate action, and 
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under

suspended if the board of directors of ADESA (or any special committee thereof) 
determines in the exercise of their fiduciary duties to entertain, negotiate or 
participate in any other Acquisition for so long as it is so entertaining, 
negotiating or participating (and shall terminate if such other Acquisition is 
completed).  In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is 
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper 
officers and directors of each party hereto shall use their respective best 
efforts to take all such necessary action.

                              ARTICLE VII

                      CERTAIN DEPOSITS, FEES AND
                         POST MERGER COVENANTS


     7.1  MPL Deposit.  MPL has deposited the sum of $1,000,000 with ADESA 
(the "Deposit"), the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, to be applied 
against the subscription price for the Common Stock to be purchased by MPL on 
the Closing Date immediately after the Effective Time as provided in section 
7.5, or if the Merger is not consummated on or before June 30, 1995, to be 
applied by ADESA as provided in section 7.3 or returned to MPL as provided in 
section 7.2.

     7.2  Return of Deposit to MPL.  The Deposit shall be returned to MPL, 
without interest, if the Merger is not consummated prior to June 30, 1995 
because of a material breach of this Agreement by ADESA or because the 
conditions precedent in sections 8.1(a), 8.1(c), 8.2(a), 8.2(c) and 8.2(d) have 
not been satisfied unless such eventuality shall be due to the failure of MPL 
or Sub to perform or observe any of the covenants, agreements and conditions 
hereof to be performed or observed by them.

                                   27

<PAGE>
     7.3  Certain Payments to ADESA.  If the Merger is not consummated on or 
before June 30, 1995 for any reason other than the reasons enumerated in 
section 7.2 above:

          (a)  ADESA shall be entitled to retain from the Deposit an amount 
     equal to ADESA's actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in 
     connection with this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated 
     hereby including travel, accounting, investment banking, engineering and 
     legal fees and expenses, and the balance, if any, shall be remitted to 
     MPL; and

          (b)  MPL shall immediately pay ADESA a termination fee of 
     $1,000,000; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing 
     provisions of this section 7.3, MPL shall not be required to pay ADESA a 
     fee of $1,000,000 if MPL terminates this Agreement because the condition 
     precedent in section 8.2(b) hereof shall not have been satisfied.

     7.4  Certain Payments to MPL.  If, during the period ending January 4, 
1996, ADESA enters into a definitive agreement with any other Person or group 
of Persons (i) with respect to an Acquisition, or (ii) the board of directors 
of ADESA recommends in a Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act that all of 
ADESA's public shareholders accept a tender offer (other than a tender offer by 
MPL or an Affiliate of MPL), or Hockett or any two other directors of ADESA 
tender any Common Stock in a tender offer, and, there-after, any such 
Acquisition is closed or the minimum number of shares of ADESA Common Stock 
required to be tendered in any such tender offer is accepted for purchase, then 
ADESA shall, within five business days of the closing of any such Acquisition 
or the acceptance for purchase of Common Stock in the tender offer, pay MPL a 
termination fee of $4,000,000, unless this Agreement was theretofore terminated 
by any party because of any of the conditions precedent specified in sections 
8.1(b), 8.1(c), 8.2(b) (solely due to events arising after the execution of 
this Agreement), 8.2(e) and 8.3 are not satisfied as required thereby.  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the purposes of this 
Section 7.4, the term "Acquisition" shall mean any acquisition, merger, 
consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, disposition, or other transaction, 
including any agreement to do any of the foregoing, that results or would 
result in the transfer to any Person or group of Persons of more than (i) 40% 
of the assets of ADESA and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) more than 
50% of the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) more than 50% of the Common Stock 
owned by the Management Shareholders.  The provisions of this section 7.4 shall 
survive the termination of this Agreement.

     7.5  Purchase of Additional Common Stock.

          (a)  On the Closing Date, but after the Effective Time, MPL will 
     purchase and pay for, and ADESA will issue to MPL, 1,000,000 shares of 
     Common Stock for the price of $17.00 

                                   28

<PAGE>
     per share, amounting in the aggregate to $17,000,000, of which amount 
     the Deposit conclusively shall be deemed partial payment therefor.

          (b)  MPL anticipates that in addition to the requirement contained 
     in section 7.5(a) during the four year period commencing at the Effective 
     Time it will provide ADESA with additional capital of approximately 
     $15,000,000 per year by the purchase of additional Common Stock.  Any such 
     additional Common Stock purchased by MPL shall be purchased at a per share 
     price equal to 20 times ADESA's trailing four fiscal quarters' after tax 
     earnings per share (calculated as if ADESA at all times owned 100% of 
     ADESA Canada), exclusive of extraordinary and non-recurring items, as 
     determined, from time to time, based upon the weighted daily average 
     number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during such four fiscal 
     quarters, which determinations may be based upon ADESA's unaudited 
     financial statements or audited financial statements if applicable.  In 
     determining the weighted daily average number of shares of Common Stock 
     outstanding, the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be deemed 
     increased by the number of shares of Common Stock which James P. Hallett 
     and Helene Hallett would own if their then owned ADESA Canada shares were 
     converted into shares of Common Stock at a conversion ratio of 9.8 shares 
     of Common Stock for each share of ADESA Canada common stock and such 
     increased number of shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been 
     outstanding during the entire four fiscal quarters.  In the event of a 
     dispute over the per share price determined under this section 7.5(b), 
     such price shall be determined by MPL's independent certified public 
     accountants.  This section 7.5(b) constitutes MPL's good faith 
     expectation, although MPL shall not be legally obligated to provide ADESA 
     with any particular amount of capital.  Any such provision of additional 
     capital by MPL shall be subject to ADESA's satisfactory prosecution of its 
     business plan and the availability of adequate investment opportunities, 
     in each case as determined, from time to time, by MPL's board of 
     directors.

     7.6  Employee Incentives.  As soon as practicable after the Effective 
Time, ADESA will approve and adopt, and MPL will cause ADESA to approve and 
adopt, an employee incentive plan which will include the provisions set forth 
in the Executive Summary annexed hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit B.

     7.7  MPL's Board of Directors.  As soon as practicable after the 
Effective Time, MPL shall cause Hockett to be named to MPL's board of 
directors, and Hockett (or such alternate nominee as selected by a majority of 
the Management Shareholders with the reasonable approval of MPL) shall be 
renominated to serve on MPL's board of directors so long as any Management 
Shareholders continue to hold any shares of Common Stock.

                                   29

<PAGE>
     7.8  ADESA's Board of Directors.  After the Effective Time, the 
Management Shareholders shall have the right to appoint that number of the 
members of ADESA's board of directors which is the largest number which 
constitutes, from time to time, a minority of ADESA's total board of directors 
so long as any Management Shareholder continues to hold any shares of Common 
Stock.

     7.9  Indemnification and Officers' and Directors' Liability Insurance.

          (a)  MPL agrees that for six years and one month after the Effective 
     Time it will not permit the articles of incorporation or bylaws of ADESA 
     or any Subsidiary to be amended if such amendment would limit or reduce 
     the indemnification rights which each present or former director of 
     officer of ADESA or any Subsidiary had under the articles of incorporation 
     and bylaws of ADESA or any Subsidiary in effect on January 1, 1994.

          (b)  For six years and one month after the Effective Time, MPL 
     agrees that it will provide or cause ADESA to continue to provide 
     officers' and directors' liability insurance covering each present and 
     former director and officer of ADESA and each Subsidiary who is presently 
     covered by officers' and directors' liability insurance or will be so 
     covered at the Effective Time on terms no less favorable than such 
     insurance maintained in effect on January 1, 1994 in terms of coverage and 
     amounts, and shall, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, 
     furnish upon request evidence that such insurance remains in full force.

          (c)  The provisions of this section 7.9 shall survive the closing of 
     the transactions contemplated hereby, is intended to benefit each present 
     and former director and officer of ADESA and each of the Subsidiaries, and 
     shall be binding on all successors and assigns of MPL, ADESA and the 
     Subsidiaries.

be agreed upon by MPL and ADESA.  The date on which the Closing occurs is 
referred to herein as the "Closing Date".  In the event that at the Closing no 
party exercises any right it may have to terminate this Agreement and no 
condition to the obligations of the parties exists that has not been satisfied 
or waived, the parties shall (i) deliver to each other the certificates, 
opinions and other documents required to be delivered under this Agreement 
including, in the case of ADESA, the Articles of Merger and (ii) at the Closing 
or as soon thereafter as possible, consummate the Merger by filing the Articles

                         TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER


     10.1 Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to 
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of matters presented in 
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of ADESA:

          (a)  By mutual consent of MPL and ADESA;

          (b)  By MPL and Sub if any of the conditions set forth in section 
     8.2 shall not have been satisfied on or before June 30, 1995, unless such 
     eventuality shall be due to the failure of MPL or Sub to perform or 
     observe any of the covenants, agreements and conditions hereof to be 
     performed by them;

          (c)  By ADESA if any of the conditions set forth in section 8.3 
     shall not have been satisfied on or before June 30, 1995, unless such 
     eventuality shall be due to the failure of ADESA to perform or observe any 
     of the covenants, agreements and conditions hereof to be performed by it;

          (d)  By either of MPL and Sub, on the one hand, or ADESA on the 
     other hand, if any of the conditions set forth in section 8.1 shall not 
     have been satisfied on or before June 30, 1995, unless such eventuality 
     shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this 
     Agreement to perform or observe any of the covenants, agreements and 
     conditions hereof to be observed by such party; or

          (e)  By ADESA upon the occurrence of an event which obligates ADESA 
     to pay MPL the fee provided for in section 7.4.

     10.2 Effect of Termination.  In the event of termination of this 
Agreement by either MPL and Sub or ADESA as provided in section 10.1, this 
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or 
obligation on the part of MPL, Sub, ADESA or the Management Shareholders except 
as set forth in sections 6.10, 6.11(b), 7.2, 7.3, 7.4., 7.9 and 11.9 and except 
to the 

                                   33

<PAGE>
extent that such termination results from the breach by a party hereto of any 
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this 
Agreement or in the Subscription and Capitalization Agreement.

     10.3 Amendment.  Subject to Section 10.5, this Agreement may be amended 
by the parties hereto at any time before or after the Merger has been approved 
by the Requisite Shareholder Approval but, after such Requisite Shareholder 
Approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by 
shareholders of ADESA without such further Requisite Shareholder Approval.  
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on 
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

     10.4 Extension; Waiver.  Subject to section 10.5, at any time prior to 
the Effective Time, the parties hereto may, by mutual written consent, to the 
extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the 
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any 
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any 
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the 
agreements or conditions contained herein.  Any agreement on the part of a 
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth 
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

     10.5 Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver.  An 
effective termination of this Agreement pursuant to section 10.1, an effective 
amendment of this Agreement pursuant to section 10.3 or an effective extension 
or waiver pursuant to section 10.4 shall require (a) in the case of MPL and Sub 
action by their respective boards of directors or the duly authorized designee 
of its board of directors and (b) in the case of ADESA, action by its board of 
directors or a special committee thereof or the duly authorized designee 
thereof.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument 
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

     11.2 Additional MPL Covenants.  If the Merger is not consummated for any 
reason, MPL agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior 
written consent of ADESA, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion 
of ADESA, (i) employ or solicit for employment any person who is or was a 
director, officer or employee of ADESA during the period commencing January 4, 
1995 and ending January 4, 1997, or (ii) directly or indirectly enter into the
