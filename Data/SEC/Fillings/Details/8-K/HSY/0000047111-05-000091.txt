February 14, 2005, the Committee approved the target grants for a 2005 AIP award for
executive officers other than Mr. Lenny, and on February 15, 2005, the Committee
recommended to the independent directors as a group a target grant for Mr. Lenny&#146;s
2005 AIP award. For executive officers other than Mr. Lenny, the final award is the
product of the executive officer&#146;s base salary, the applicable target percentage and
a performance score calculated as the sum of a corporate performance score and an
individual score. The corporate performance objectives for executive officers other than
Mr. Lenny are based on earnings per share-diluted, consolidated net sales and consolidated
economic return on invested capital. The range of the target percentages of base salary
used in the 2005 AIP target grants for executive officers other than Mr. Lenny is 50% to
70%. For Mr. Lenny, the Committee recommended to the independent directors that his final
award be based on his performance against certain corporate and individual objectives. Mr.
Lenny&#146;s 2005 AIP corporate objectives are based on consolidated net sales, operating
income, earnings per share-diluted, consolidated economic return on invested capital and
free cash flow. The Committee recommended that Mr. Lenny&#146;s target maximum award for
2005 be set at the maximum award level available to executive officers under the Incentive
Plan, and waived the maximum AIP award specified in Mr. Lenny&#146;s March 12, 2001
Employment Agreement. At the end of the performance period, the Committee will review Mr.
Lenny&#146;s actual performance against his 2005 objectives and recommend to the
independent directors an award which, based upon such performance, may be at or below the
target maximum award. The independent directors as a group approved the Committee&#146;s
recommended 2005 AIP target grant for Mr. Lenny on February 15, 2005. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on
February 14, 2005, the Committee approved contingent target grants of PSUs under the
Incentive Plan for executive officers other than Mr. Lenny, and on February 15, 2005, the
Committee recommended to the independent directors as a group a contingent target grant of
PSUs under the Incentive Plan for Mr. Lenny, for the 2005-2007 PSU performance cycle. PSU
grants are based upon a percentage of the executive officer&#146;s base salary and are
earned based upon the Company&#146;s performance relative to certain performance
objectives over the three-year cycle. The performance objectives for the 2005-2007
performance cycle are as follows: the Company&#146;s earnings per share-diluted growth
(three-year compound annual growth rate) measured against the earnings per share-diluted
growth (three-year compound annual growth rate) of a peer group of 16 food, beverage and
consumer packaged goods companies and the cumulative three-year improvement in the
Company&#146;s economic return on invested capital measured against an internal target.
The independent directors as a group approved the Committee&#146;s recommended contingent
target PSU grant for Mr. Lenny on February 15, 2005. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stock
Option Grants.</I> The Committee approved stock option grants under the Incentive Plan for
the executive officers other than Mr. Lenny, and recommended to the independent directors
as a group a stock option grant to Mr. Lenny, all such grants to be effective
February&nbsp;15, 2005. The independent directors as a group ratified the grant of stock
options to Mr. Lenny on February 15, 2005. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock
options were granted subject to certain Terms and Conditions approved by the Committee on
February 14, 2005 (and with respect to Mr. Lenny&#146;s grant, were ratified by the
independent directors as a group on February 15, 2005), which Terms and Conditions are
attached hereto and filed as Exhibit 10.1. Unless and until amended by the Committee, all
future grants of stock options under the Incentive Plan will be subject to these Terms and
Conditions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee also approved on February 14, 2005 amendments to the Company&#146;s Long-Term
Incentive Program Participation Agreement (&#147;LTIP Agreement&#148;). The LTIP Agreement
is entered into between the Company and any officer of the Company that is eligible to
participate in the PSU portion of the Incentive Plan. The purpose of the LTIP Agreement is
to provide for enhanced confidentiality requirements, an agreement not to compete with the
Company if the officer becomes eligible for supplemental retirement benefits under the
Company&#146;s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, and an arbitration program to be
the sole and exclusive method for resolving disputes. Mr. Lenny&#146;s rights and
obligations under the LTIP Agreement are subject to his Employment Agreement with the
Company dated as of March 12, 2001. A copy of the LTIP Agreement is attached hereto and
filed as Exhibit 10.2. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,
on February 15, 2005, the independent directors as a group approved the Committee&#146;s
recommendation to revise its policy regarding Mr. Lenny&#146;s use of the Company&#146;s
aircraft for non-business purposes. The new policy removes dollar limitations applicable
to such use and encourages such use by Mr. Lenny to ensure confidentiality of information while traveling and to allow
Mr. Lenny more time to concentrate on the Company's business, maximizing efficiency. </FONT></P>

          <B>[option grant date]</B>, (the &#147;Grant Date&#148;), accepts and agrees to

          through <B>[the date immediately preceding the 10<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of

          vesting schedule described in the next sentence and the provisions regarding
          termination set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 below and in the Plan. Of the total
          Options granted to the Optionee on the Grant Date (&#147;Total Grant&#148;),
          twenty-five percent (25%) of the Total Grant will become vested on the first
          anniversary of the Grant Date; an additional twenty-five percent (25%) of the
          Total Grant will become vested on the second anniversary of the Grant Date; an
          additional twenty-five percent (25%) of the Total Grant will become vested on

          (25%) of the Total Grant will become vested on the fourth anniversary of the
          Grant Date. During the Exercise Period, vested Options may be exercised in whole
          or in part and on one or more than one occasion. The purchase price of any
          shares as to which the Options shall be exercised shall be paid in full at the

employment or, if such 90<SUP>th</SUP> day is not a New York Stock Exchange trading day,
the first day after such 90<SUP>th</SUP> day that is a New York Stock Exchange trading day
(&#147;Corporate Event Exercise Deadline&#148;). Optionee shall have the right to exercise
any Options that vest on or prior to the Corporate Event Exercise Deadline at the time or
after such Options vest but on or before the Corporate Event Exercise Deadline. In no
event, however, may Options be exercised after <B>[the date immediately preceding the
10<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the option grant date]</B>, the date the Options expire.
For purposes of this grant, a Corporate Event shall mean a corporate action, such as the
sale of a subsidiary or business unit, a corporate restructuring, or other material,
non-recurring event which results in the displacement or elimination of a significant
number of jobs and which is required to be disclosed as a separate matter in the
Corporation&#146;s financial statements. </FONT></P>

the occurrence of a Change in Control (as that term is defined in the Plan), the Options

in paragraph 2 above. If Optionee&#146;s employment is terminated by the Corporation
within two (2) years following the Change in Control for any reason other than for Cause
(as that term is defined in the Plan) or if Optionee&#146;s employment is terminated by
the Optionee within such two year period for Good Reason (as that term is defined in the
Plan), Optionee shall have one (1) year from the date of termination of employment to

          Optionee&#146;s retirement date occurs and the denominator of which equals 12;

that I have been selected to participate in the Key Employee Incentive Plan (the
&#147;Plan&#148;), including the Long-Term Incentive Program (&#147;LTIP&#148;) under the
Plan. I understand, acknowledge and agree that the purpose of this Agreement is to provide
for enhanced confidentiality requirements, an agreement not to compete with Hershey if I
become eligible for supplemental retirement benefits, and an arbitration program to be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving disputes. I understand and acknowledge that by
this Agreement, both I and Hershey, in order to avoid delay and expense, are mutually
waiving the right of access to a judicial forum for resolving disputes covered by the
arbitration program. I hereby accept the opportunity to participate in the Plan, including
the LTIP, and in consideration of my selection by Hershey to be a participant in the Plan
and being eligible to receive benefits under the Plan, I agree to the following: </FONT></P>

of certain goals and objectives, I will be eligible to receive Annual Incentive Program

unacceptable. If only one common name remains on the lists of all parties, that individual
shall be designated as the Arbitrator. If more than one common name remains on the lists
of all parties, the parties shall strike names alternately from the list of common names
until only one remains. The party who did not initiate the claim shall strike first. If no
common name exists on the lists of all parties, the sponsoring organization shall furnish
an additional list and the process shall be repeated. If no arbitrator has been selected
after two lists have been distributed, then the parties shall strike alternately from a
third list, with the party initiating the claim striking first, until only one name
remains. That person shall be designated as the Arbitrator. </FONT></P>
