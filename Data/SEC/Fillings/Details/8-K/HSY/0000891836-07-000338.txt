growth and take advantage of all opportunities we see in the marketplace.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>West said, &#147;It is our
overarching goal to make sure that we have a smooth and seamless transition at both the
management and Board levels. I am already working with Rick to ensure that is the case
with our management, and I look forward to working closely with Ken and the new Board of
Directors to identify and pursue strategic growth initiatives to build foundations for the
Company&#146;s long-term prosperity.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Said Lenny, &#147;I want to thank the
outgoing directors for their service to the Company and all of its stakeholders. On behalf
of all of The Hershey Company&#146;s constituents, thank you.&#148; </FONT></P>

The Hershey Trust Board, &#147;The Hershey Trust, which is obligated to manage its assets
solely for the benefit of Milton Hershey School, a school for children in need, has made
clear it has not been satisfied with the Company&#146;s recent results.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>He continued: &#147;After careful
reflection and consideration of our responsibilities to the Trust, and the best interests
of all Hershey Company shareholders &#150; and after a due-diligence period in which we
investigated and ascertained the considerable interest of best-in-class directors who were
eager to work with the Trust to benefit all shareholders &#150; we determined to elect new
Directors to aggressively pursue addressing the Company&#146;s business challenges.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Together
and individually, these new directors are independent-minded leaders with world-class
capabilities and highly relevant expertise,&#148; said Zimmerman. &#147;Having implemented
these changes, the Trust Board will return to allowing this Company Board and Management
team to do their jobs and lead the Company to new successes.&#148; </FONT></P>
