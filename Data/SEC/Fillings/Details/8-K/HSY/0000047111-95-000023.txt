                   Hershey Foods Purchases Common Stock


HERSHEY, Pa. --- Hershey Foods Corporation announced that it has
purchased today 9,049,773 shares of its Common Stock from Hershey
Trust Company, as Trustee under the deed of trust with Milton S.
Hershey and Catherine S. Hershey for benefit of Milton Hershey
School.  The Corporation paid $55.25 per share, or approximately
$500 million for the shares. 

     Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for Milton Hershey School,
has advised Hershey Foods Corporation that it sold the shares to
further diversify its investment holdings.  It also stated that
it intends to retain its voting control of the Corporation, which
it has held since 1918, and that it has no present intention of
selling any additional shares of the Corporation's stock.  The
Hershey Trust, as Trustee, which had 77.1 percent of the voting
power of both classes of common stock prior to the transaction,
has 76.1 percent following the transaction.  It continues to hold
99.4 percent of all Class B Common Stock shares outstanding,
which carry 10 votes per share.

     Milton Hershey School, located in Hershey, Pa., is a
private, non-profit boarding school for needy children.  The
School currently cares for over 1,000 boys and girls in grades
kindergarten through twelve.  The full cost of education and
board for the students at the School is paid from income of the
Trust created by Mr. and Mrs. Hershey. 

     "This transaction represents an excellent opportunity to
invest our free cash flow," said Kenneth L. Wolfe, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer.  "It will be additive to earnings per
share, increase our return on equity and have a relatively low
impact on our future free cash flows.  In addition, our financial
flexibility to invest in our businesses and in continued future
additional open market stock repurchase programs, as well as
increase dividends, remains strong."

     Hershey Foods Corporation is a leading producer of a broad
line of chocolate, confectionery, pasta, chocolate grocery and
other food products.
