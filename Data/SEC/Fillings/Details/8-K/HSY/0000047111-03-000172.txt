                 HERSHEY FOODS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
                       AND NEW VALUE-ENHANCING INITIATIVES


HERSHEY, Pa., July 17, 2003--- Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today
announced sales and earnings for the second quarter ended June 29, 2003.
Consolidated net sales for the second quarter were $849,115,000 compared with
$823,462,000 for the second quarter of 2002. Net income for the second quarter
of 2003 was $71,484,000, or $.54 per share-diluted, compared with $63,148,000,
or $.46 per share-diluted, for the comparable period in 2002.

These GAAP results include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization
and realignment initiatives of $4.0 million, or $.02 per share-diluted, in the
second quarter of 2003; and $2.5 million, or $.01 per share-diluted, in the
second quarter of 2002.

<PAGE>

Excluding  these  charges,  net  income  for the  second  quarter  of  2003  was
$73,998,000,  or $.56 per share-diluted,  compared with $64,752,000, or $.47 per
share-diluted, for the second quarter of 2002.

SIX-MONTHS RESULTS
- ------------------

For the first six months of 2003, consolidated net sales were $1,802,277,000
compared with $1,811,968,000 for the first half of 2002. Net income for the
first six months of 2003 was $169,042,000, or $1.27 per share-diluted, compared
with $150,193,000, or $1.09 per share-diluted, for the first half of 2002.

These GAAP results include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization
and realignment initiatives of $4.0 million, or $.02 per share-diluted, in the
second quarter of 2003; and $11.5 million, or $.05 per share-diluted, in the
first half of 2002. Excluding these charges, net income for the first half of
2003 was $171,556,000, or $1.29 per share-diluted, compared with $157,495,000,
or $1.14 per share-diluted, for the first half of 2002.

The Corporation uses earnings excluding charges related to business
rationalization and realignment initiatives, as shown in the attached pro forma
income statements, as a key performance measure of results of operations for
purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not
intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with
GAAP. Rather, the Corporation believes the presentation of earnings excluding
such charges provides additional information to

<PAGE>


investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding
items  which the  Corporation  does not believe  are  indicative  of its ongoing
operations.

The 2002 business realignment initiatives are described in Management's
Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 of the Corporation's 2002 Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The components of the 2003 brand and product rationalization
initiatives and realignment of the sales organization are described below.


2003 RATIONALIZATION AND REALIGNMENT INITIATIVES
- ------------------------------------------------

Hershey today announced a number of initiatives continuing its value-enhancing
strategy. These include new product introductions, streamlining the supply chain
by divesting or eliminating certain non-strategic brands and products,
production line rationalization, and realigning the sales organization.

During 2003, these actions are expected to result in a net charge of
approximately $17 million, or $.08 per share-diluted, of which $.02 per
share-diluted have been recognized in the second quarter. The total impact of
the initiatives will be cash flow positive in 2003 and slightly accretive in
2004 as a result of expected savings of approximately $5 million annually.

SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE
- --------------------------

Hershey's second quarter sales increased 3.1 percent, reflecting sales of new
products and limited edition items, as well as the impact of the price increase
announced in December 2002, partially offset by brand and product
rationalization. Gross margin expanded as a
<PAGE>

result of pricing,  lower raw ingredient and packaging  costs,  and supply chain
savings. Selling, marketing, and administrative costs were essentially flat as a
percentage of sales.

"Hershey achieved solid performance in the second quarter of 2003," said Richard
H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, "with balanced gains
in sales, profitability, and returns. In addition, our marketplace momentum
continues to build with market share gains driven by our leading brands, instant
consumables, and continued strength in high growth channels. Margins and
profitability also increased through a combination of better price realization
and on-going productivity savings.

"The rationalization and realignment initiatives announced today are the latest
steps in our value-enhancing strategy. The sale of non-strategic brands and
relocation of certain manufacturing lines will further streamline the supply
chain, ensuring proper resource allocation against our growth opportunities.
Realigning the sales force provides us with superior category selling
capabilities and improved coverage at retail.

"On the new product front, we plan to introduce HERSHEY'S S'MORES candy bar, a
major new product which will be available in stores late this year. HERSHEY'S
S'MORES is a convenient candy bar form of the traditional campfire favorite,
incorporating graham crackers, marshmallow, and HERSHEY'S milk chocolate.
Consumers overwhelmingly associate homemade s'mores with HERSHEY'S milk
chocolate. Later in the year we also will launch SWOOPS chocolate slices in four
favorite flavors, packaged in re-sealable on-the-go containers. Also adding
excitement to Hershey's fall line-up are Reese's mini pieces in portable tubes,
as well as additional Limited Edition REESE'S offerings.

"Together these initiatives build upon the progress we've made to date and will
further advance our goal of delivering superior shareholder value over the long
term," Lenny concluded.
