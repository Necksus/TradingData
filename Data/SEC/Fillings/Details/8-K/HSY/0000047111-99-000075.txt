               HERSHEY FOODS RESULTS EXPECTED TO MISS EXPECTATIONS

HERSHEY,  PA.--Hershey Foods Corporation announced today that it expects to miss
earnings  per share  expectations  for the third  quarter  and fiscal year 1999,
primarily  as a  result  of  problems  encountered  in the July  startup  of new
business  systems,  in the  areas of  customer  service,  warehousing  and order
fulfillment.  Earnings  per  share for the year  could  fall 8% to 10% below our
previous  expectations  of $2.40  per  share,  with  the  bulk of the  shortfall
occurring in the third quarter.

Kenneth L. Wolfe,  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  said,  "We are going
through  a very  challenging  period in  providing  the  order  fulfillment  and
customer service levels which customers have come to expect from Hershey.  While
order  patterns  have  remained  strong,  we  have  been  unable  to  fill  them
completely,  in a timely fashion. We have put in place an action plan to resolve
our order  backlog  and get us back on  schedule.  With the  present  demand for
Back-To-School/Halloween  and the upcoming Christmas season, however, we believe
it will be mid-to late  October  before  we are  fully  back on  schedule.  Our
customers  are  being   notified  of  this  plan  and,  we  believe  with  their
cooperation, we can meet this challenge."
