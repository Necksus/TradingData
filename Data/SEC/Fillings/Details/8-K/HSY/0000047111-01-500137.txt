                   HERSHEY ANNOUNCES VALUE-ENHANCING STRATEGY



HERSHEY, Pa., October 24, 2001 -- Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today
will announce initiatives to enhance the future operating performance of the
Company. To support these initiatives, it will record business realignment
charges totaling $275 million pretax, or $1.24 per share-diluted, in the fourth
quarter of 2001 and in 2002.

The charges will include restructuring charges of $218 million or $.99 per
share-diluted and operating charges of $57 million or $.25 per share-diluted.
$1.08 per share-diluted is expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001
and $.16 per share-diluted is expected to be recorded in 2002.

These business realignment initiatives will generate ongoing annual savings of
$60-$65 million when fully implemented. The savings will be reinvested to create
enhanced marketing and selling capabilities. Cash flows for the business will
immediately increase as a result of these initiatives.

The restructuring charges will include costs related to the elimination of
certain non-strategic brands, the elimination of underutilized capacity through
the closure of three manufacturing facilities and one distribution center,
realignment of the sales organization, a voluntary workforce reduction program,
and outsourcing the production of cocoa powder. The operating charges will
include costs related to selling off and reducing raw material inventories,
principally cocoa beans, no longer required to support operations and
write-downs of inventory related to products to be discontinued.

In announcing the new initiatives, Richard H. Lenny, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Hershey Foods Corporation, said, "Hershey is a great company
with immense strengths and an enviable track record. Our strategy both builds on
these strengths and capitalizes on significant growth opportunities across
Hershey's business system. The result will be consistent delivery of superior
financial performance that rewards shareholders over the long term."

Management will discuss the new value-enhancing strategies during a conference
call, also available by web cast, beginning at 10:00 a.m. today. Please go to
the Investor Relations Section of the Web site (http://www.hersheys.com) for
further details.
