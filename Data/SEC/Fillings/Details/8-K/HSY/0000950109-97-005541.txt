                             Underwriting Agreement

                                                                 August 21, 1997


Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
85 Broad Street,
New York, New York  10004.


Dear Sirs:

     From time to time Hershey Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a
"Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and
deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and
conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in
Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the
"Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities
specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified
in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing
Agreement, the "Designated Securities").

     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities
shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or
pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing
Agreement.

     1.    Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to
time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as
representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement
relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives").  The term
"Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of
the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated
as their representative.  This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as
an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation
of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities.  The obligation of the
Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the
Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing
Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein.  Each
Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such
Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated
Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated
Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the
names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of
such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set
forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and
payment therefor.  The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not
set forth in the Indenture and the registration statement and prospectus with
respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities.  A Pricing Agreement
shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and
may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid
transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications
transmitted.  The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each
Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

     2.    The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the
Underwriters that

     (a)   The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
     (the "Commission") a registration statement or registration statements in
     respect of the Securities; such registration statement or
<PAGE>
 
     registration statements and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in
     the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives
     and, excluding exhibits thereto but including all documents incorporated by
     reference in the prospectus contained therein, to the Representatives for
     each of the other Underwriters have been declared effective by the
     Commission in such form; no other document with respect to such
     registration statement or registration statements or document incorporated
     by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing
     with the Commission; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such
     registration statement or registration statements has been issued and no
     proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the
     Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in such registration
     statement or registration statements or filed with the Commission pursuant
     to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the
     Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), being hereinafter called a
     "Preliminary Prospectus"; the various parts of such registration statement
     or registration statements, including all exhibits thereto and the
     documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in the
     registration statement or registration statements at the time such part of
     the registration statement or registration statements became effective but
     excluding Form T-1, each as amended at the time such part of the
     registration statement or registration statements became effective, being
     hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; the prospectus relating to
     the Securities, in the form in which it has most recently been filed, or
     transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this
     Agreement, being hereinafter called the "Prospectus"; any reference herein
     to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to
     and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the
     applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary
     Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any
     amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus
     shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date
     of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and
     incorporated by reference in such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as
     the case may be; any reference to any amendment to the Registration
     Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the
     Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after
     the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by
     reference in the Registration Statement; any reference to the Registration
     Statement shall be deemed to refer to only such registration statement or
     registration statements, as amended by any post-effective amendments
     thereto, pursuant to which the Designated Securities were registered; and
     any reference to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed
     to refer to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the
     applicable Designated Securities in the form in which it is filed with the
     Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section
     5(a) hereof, including any documents incorporated by reference therein as
     of the date of such filing);


     (b)   The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they
     became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be,
     conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the
     Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
     Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue
     statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
     to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
     misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by
     reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto,
     when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as
     the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements
     of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and
     regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
     be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
     misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall
     not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in
     conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an
     Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly
     for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such
     Securities;


     (c)   The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any 
     further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
     Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of
     the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust
     Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
     and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the
     Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable
     filing date as to the

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
     Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, contain an untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
     be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
     misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall
     not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in
     conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an
     Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly
     for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such
     Securities;

     (d)   Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the
     Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any change in
     the capital stock (other than the conversion of less than 250,000 shares of
     the Company's Class B Common Stock ("Class B Common Stock") to Common Stock
     or issuances under employee stock incentive plans or repurchases pursuant
     to the Company's share repurchase program announced during February 1996
     (the "1996 Repurchase Program") or the repurchase of Common Stock from the
     Hershey Trust Company as announced on August 8, 1997 (the "1997
     Repurchase")) or increases in the consolidated long-term debt of the
     Company and any of its subsidiaries (exclusive of increases of $20 million
     or less of long-term debt other than capitalized lease obligations,
     increases attributable to new capitalized lease obligations aggregating $5
     million or less and increases related to the translation of foreign
     currency indebtedness at rates of exchange different from those in effect
     on the respective dates as of which information is so given) or any
     material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective
     material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management,
     financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the
     Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth
     or contemplated in the Prospectus;

     (e)   The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a
     corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
     incorporation, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its
     properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus;

     (f)   The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the
     Prospectus, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company
     have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and 
     non-assessable;

     (g)   The Indenture dated as of February 1, 1991 between the Company and
     Citibank, N.A. has been duly authorized and duly qualified under the Trust
     Indenture Act and the Indenture constitutes a valid and legally binding
     instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
     enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of
     general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
     general equity principles; the Securities have been duly authorized, and,
     when Designated Securities are issued and delivered pursuant to this
     Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated
     Securities, such Designated Securities will have been duly executed,
     authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute valid and legally
     binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the
     Indenture, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or
     affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the
     Indenture conforms, and the Designated Securities will conform, to the
     descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented
     with respect to such Designated Securities;

     (h)   The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the 
     Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, this
     Agreement and any Pricing Agreement, and the consummation of the
     transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or
     result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or
     constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
     agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party
     or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets
     of the Company is subject the result of which will have a material adverse
     change or effect on the general affairs, management, financial position,
     stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
     subsidiaries, taken as a whole, nor will such action result in any
     violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
     By-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of
     any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the
     Company or any of its properties; and no consent approval, authorization,
     order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or
     governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
     the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement or any Pricing Agreement or the Indenture,
     except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Time of Delivery
     (as defined in Section 4 hereof), obtained under the Act and the Trust
     Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations
     or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky
     laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by
     the Underwriters; and

     (i)   Other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or
     governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries would individually or in the aggregate
     have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
     stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
     subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to the best of the Company's
     knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by
     governmental authorities or threatened by others.

     3.    Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any
Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of
such Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer such
Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

     4.    Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to
the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in global form, and in such authorized
denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request
upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered
by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such
Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the
purchase price therefor by certified or official bank check or checks or wire
transfer, payable to the order of the Company in federal or other immediately
available funds, all at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing
Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and
the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called
the "Time of Delivery" for such Securities.

     5.    The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated
Securities:

     (a)   To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation 
     to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the
     Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
     the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second
     business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement
     relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such
     earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further
     amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as
     amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to
     such Securities and prior to the time of Delivery for such Securities which
     shall be reasonably disapproved in writing by the Representatives for such

           subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the

           aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
           financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of
           the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to such
           counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or

           (vi)   The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
           by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and legally binding
           instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
           enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws
           of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights

           qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;

           (vii)  The issue and sale of the Designated Securities and the

           mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or
           instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or
           by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or
           assets of the Company is subject the result of which will have a
           material adverse change or effect on the general affairs, management,
           financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of
           the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, nor will such
           actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated
           Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any statute
           or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court
           or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company

           qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky
           laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the
           Designated Securities by the Underwriters;

           (ix)   The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as 
           amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and
           related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no
           opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the
           Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material
           respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as
           applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission
           thereunder, and they have no reason to believe that any of such
           documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case
           may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which
           became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material
           fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
           therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
           or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or
           the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a
           material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order
           to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
           which they were made when such documents were so filed, not
           misleading; and

           (x)    The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or 
           supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made
           by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated
           Securities (other than the financial statements and related schedules
           therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as
           to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and
           the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
           they have no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the
           Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the
           Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial
           statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel
           need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material
           fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
           therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
           that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or
           any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior
           to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and
           related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no
           opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
           to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
           light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or
           that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement
           or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment
           or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of
           Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules
           therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains
           an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
           fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
           circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and they do
           not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to
           be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required
           to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required
           to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or
           supplemented or required to be described in the Registration
           Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not
           filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;

     (d)   At the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the 
     independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial
     statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by
     reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the
     Representatives a letter, dated the Time of Delivery, to the effect set
     forth in Annex II hereto, and as to such other matters as the
     Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance
     satisfactory to the Representatives;

     (e)   Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the
     Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change
     in the capital stock (other than the conversion of less than 250,000 shares
     of Class B Common Stock to Common Stock or issuances under employee stock
     incentive plans or repurchases pursuant to the 1996 Repurchase Program or
     the 1997 Repurchase or increases in the consolidated long-term debt of the
     Company and any of its subsidiaries (exclusive of increases of $20 million
     or less of long-term debt other than capitalized lease obligations,
     increases attributable to new capitalized lease obligations aggregating $5
     million or less and increases related to the translation of foreign
     currency indebtedness at rates of exchange different from those in effect
     on the respective dates as of which information is so given) or any change,
     or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the
     general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or
     results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as
     amended or supplemented, the effect of which is in the judgment of the
     Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or
     inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the
     Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
     Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

     (f)   On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the 
     Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating
     accorded the Company's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
     ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P") and (ii) neither
     Moody's not S&P shall have publicly announced that it has under
     surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, it rating of
     any of the Company's debt securities;

     (g)   On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
     Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following:
     (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally
     or the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial
     banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State
     authorities; or (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving
     the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national
     emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this Clause
     (iii) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or
     inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the
     Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
     Prospectus as amended or supplemented; and

     (h)   The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the
     Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a
     certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the
     Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
     the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the
     performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be
     performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth
     in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as
     the Representatives may reasonably request.

     8.    (a)   The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter
     against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
     which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise,
     insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
     respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or
     alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary
     Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration
     Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other
     prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement

     that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based
     upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
     omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus
     supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
     supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any

     written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of
     Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the
     Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities; and
     provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter
     under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any
     Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
     liability of such Underwriter results from the fact such Underwriter sold
     Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to
     the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding
     documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended
     or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case
     where such delivery is required by the Act if the Company has previously
     furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter and the loss, claim, damage or
     liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission
     of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus which was
     corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented).

     (b)   Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company 
     against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may
     become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
     damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
     based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
     fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus
     supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
     supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
     amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the
     omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
     be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
     misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent that such
     untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
     omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus
     supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
     supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
     such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with
     written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through
     the Representatives expressly for use therein; and, subject to subsection
     (c) below, will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses
     reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or
     defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

     (c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) 
     or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
     party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to made against the
     indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in
     writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
     indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
     have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case
     any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall
     notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying
     party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it
     shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified,
     to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such
     indemnified party (who shall not except with the consent of the indemnified
     party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the
     indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume
     the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such
     indemnified

     party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
     other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified
     party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs
     of investigation. The indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above
     shall only be liable for the legal expenses of one counsel for all
     indemnified parties in each jurisdiction in which any claim or action is
     brought. An indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above shall not
     enter into a settlement of any litigation in respect of which a claim is to
     be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection unless such
     settlement is effected with the consent of the indemnifying party.

     (d)   If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable 
     to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection
     (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
     (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying
     party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
     party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
     actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
     not only the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and
     the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the
     offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or
     liability (or action in respect thereof) relates but also the relative
     fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated
     Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
     which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
     in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable
     considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one
     hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
     proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting
     expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts
     and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be
     determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
     alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
     omissions to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
     Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and parties'
     relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
     correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the
     Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
     pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation
     (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or
     by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
     equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The
     amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
     claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to
     above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other
     expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
     investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
     provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to
     contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at
     which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and
     distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of
     any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by
     reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
     omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
     meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
     any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
     obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection
     (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective
     underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.

     (e)   The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in 
     addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall
     extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who
     controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act, and the obligations
     of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any
     liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall
     extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of
     the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
     meaning of the Act.

     9.    (a)   If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase 
     the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing
     Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may
     in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other party
     or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms
     contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any
     Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such
     Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further
     period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other
     parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated
     Securities on

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
     such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the
     Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the
     purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the
     Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated
     Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to
     postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period
     of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may
     thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
     as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and
     the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the
     Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the reasonable opinion of
     the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter"
     as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this
     Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to
     the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.

     (b)   If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
     Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
     Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
     aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains
     unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount
     of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to
     require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of
     Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the
     Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition,
     to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share
     (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such
     Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the
     Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for
     which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall
     relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

     (c)   If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
     Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
     Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
     aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains
     unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the
     Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the
     Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to
     require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a
     defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating
     to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability
     on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for
     the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in
     Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8
     hereof, but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from
     liability for its default.

     10.   The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth
in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to
this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf
of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company,
or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall
survive delivery of any payment of the Securities.

     11.   If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9
hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter
with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement
except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other
reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as
provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the
Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the
Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably
incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and
delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no
further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities
except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.

                                       11

     12.   In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of
Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the
parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request,
notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such
Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be
designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.

     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in
writing, and it to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the
Pricing Agreement: and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail,
telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the
Registration Statement.  Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any
notice to any Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or
sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address
set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such
Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the
Representatives.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall
take effect upon receipt thereof.

     13.   This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and
inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent
provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the
Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no
other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this
Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement.  No purchaser of any of the Securities
from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of
such purchase.

     14.   Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement.  As used
herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in
Washington, D.C. is open for business.

     15.   This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

     16.   This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one
or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and
return to us five counterparts hereof.

                              Very truly yours,

Pursuant to Section 7(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall
furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:

          (i)    They are independent certified public accountants with respect
     to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the
     applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;

          (ii)   In their opinion, the financial statements and any
     supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable,
     prospective financial statements and/or pro forma financial information)
     audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the
     Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material
     respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the
     Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and
     regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in
     accordance with standards established by the American Institute of
     Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial
     statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information,
     prospective financial statements and/or condensed financial statements
     derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods
     specified in such letter, as indicted in their reports thereon, copies of
     which have been furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the
     "Representatives");

          (iii)  The unaudited selected financial information with respect to
     the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the
     Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus or
     included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual
     Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the
     corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited
     consolidated financial statements for five such fiscal years which were
     included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on
     Form 10-K for such fiscal years;

          (iv)   On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit

     statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute
     books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest
     audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
     Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries
     responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries
     and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their
     attention that caused them to believe that:

                 (A) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income,
          consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows
          included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly
          Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do

          accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q
