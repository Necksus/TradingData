        Hershey Chocolate U.S.A. Announces Domestic Price Increase


HERSHEY, Pa. --- Hershey Chocolate U.S.A. today announced that it
is increasing the wholesale price of its standard bar line and
king size bars by 11 percent.  This price increase is effective
today, December 4, 1995, and does not affect other product lines. 
In order to protect trade commitments, limited orders will be
accepted at old prices.

This is the first price increase in the standard bar line in
nearly five years.  It is being initiated because of the
cumulative impact over these five years of increased costs for
packaging, fuel, transportation, labor and benefits, as well as
rising costs of raw materials.
