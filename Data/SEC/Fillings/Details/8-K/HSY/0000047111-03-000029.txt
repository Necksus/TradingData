                             HERSHEY FOODS ANNOUNCES
                      FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS


HERSHEY, Pa., January 29, 2003--Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today

announced  sales and earnings for the fourth  quarter  ended  December 31, 2002.

Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1,156,028,000  compared with

$1,152,980,000  for the fourth quarter of 2001. Net income was $130,320,000,  or

$.96 per  share-diluted,  compared with a loss of  ($44,951,000),  or ($.33) per

share-diluted, in 2001.


The results for the fourth  quarter of 2002  included a pre-tax  charge of $13.3

million,  or $.06 per  share-diluted,  associated with the business  realignment

initiatives  announced in October  2001.  The results for the fourth  quarter of

2001 included a one-time charge of $278.4 million,  or $1.25 per  share-diluted,

related to the realignment process, as well as the amortization of goodwill.


                                    - more -

Excluding  the  one-time  items,  net income for the fourth  quarter of 2002 was

$138,690,000,  or $1.02 per share-diluted,  compared with $130,523,000,  or $.95

per share-diluted, a gain of 7.4 percent.


For the full year 2002, consolidated net sales were $4,120,317,000 compared with

$4,137,217,000 for 2001.  Net income for 2002 was  $403,578,000,  or $2.93 per

share-  diluted,  compared with  $207,156,000,  or $1.50 per share diluted,  the

prior year.


Results  for 2002  included  cumulative  pre-tax  realignment  charges  of $34.0

million,  or $.16 per share-diluted,  and pre-tax expenses of $17.2 million,  or

$.08 per  share-diluted,  related to the exploration of the sale of the Company;

and in 2001, results included the pre-tax charge of $278.4 million, or $1.25 per

share-diluted,  related to the realignment initiatives,  the gain on the sale of

the Luden's business in the third quarter, and the amortization of goodwill.


Excluding  one-time items,  net income for 2002 was  $435,994,000,  or $3.17 per

share- diluted,  compared with  $391,482,000,  or $2.84 per  share-diluted,  for

2001, an increase of 11.6 percent. A pro forma income statement reflecting these

adjustments accompanies this press release.


Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased by 0.3 percent on a nominal

basis. On a comparable basis, net sales increased by about 1.0 percent spurred

by a customer  buy-in  related to the price  increase  announced on December 10,

2002.  Fourth  quarter sales were one to two percent higher than they would have

been


                                    - more -

absent the buy-in.  This  increase in sales was offset  somewhat by higher trade

promotion  expense,  lower domestic seasonal sales, and weakness in the Canadian

market. Gross margin improved by 60 basis points as a result of improved mix and

enhanced  supply chain  efficiencies.  Selling,  Marketing,  and  Administrative

expenses  decreased by 30 basis points as a percentage of sales  resulting  from

significantly lower general and administrative  costs, which were only partially

offset by higher selling and marketing expenses.


For the year, sales were off slightly, but the mix of revenues was significantly

strengthened as we focused on higher margin products, packtypes, and channels of

trade.  The improved sales mix, price  increases on the packaged candy line, and

supply chain  efficiencies led to a 130 basis point improvement in gross margin.

For the year, Selling,  Marketing and Administrative  expenses declined 30 basis

points as a percentage of sales, due to lower general and administrative  costs,

which more than offset higher selling and marketing expenses.


"Hershey's  fourth quarter results were in line with  expectations,  achieving a

balance of improved marketplace  performance and profitability," said Richard H.

Lenny,  Chairman,  President,  and Chief Executive Officer.  "Despite a sluggish

retail environment,  Hershey's consumer takeaway  increased,  resulting in a 0.4

point gain in market share. Equally as important,  supply chain productivity and

tight expense control continued to deliver solid gains during the quarter.

                                    - more -

"For the full year, we made good progress against our value-enhancing strategy.

Profitability,  margins,  and  returns  delivered  strong  growth  versus  2001,

reflecting  improved mix,  productivity gains across the supply chain, and lower

general and  administrative  spending.  Although net sales were flat in the U.S.

business,  retail takeaway in all food,  drug,  mass, and convenience  channels,

increased by three percent.  This performance  reflects our disciplined focus on

building Hershey's core brands (+8 %), expanding our leadership  position in the

key chocolate  category (+5 %), and significantly  improving  performance in the

high growth convenience store channel (+9 %).


"Overall,  I'm most pleased with the Company's  results in 2002.  Our ability to

deliver solid performance,  despite numerous challenges, positions us well as we

continue to implement Hershey's long-term growth initiatives," Lenny concluded.
