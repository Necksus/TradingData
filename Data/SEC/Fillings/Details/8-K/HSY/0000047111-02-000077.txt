                      INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT

Item 4.  Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

         On April 30, 2002, the Board of Directors of Hershey Foods Corporation
(the "Company"), upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee, approved the
dismissal of Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as the Company's independent
auditors. Andersen had served as the Company's independent auditors since 1927.
A new independent public accounting firm has not yet been engaged to act as the
Company's independent auditors.

         Andersen's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain an adverse
opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

         During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through the date
of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have
caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their
report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years; and
there were no reportable events, as listed in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K.

         The Company provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures.
Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of Andersen's letter, dated May 1, 2002,
stating its agreement with such statements.

                       Exchange Commission dated May 1, 2002.

undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
