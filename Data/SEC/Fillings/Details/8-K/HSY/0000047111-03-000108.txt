                  HERSHEY FOODS ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS


HERSHEY, Pa., April 17, 2003--Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE: HSY) today
announced sales and earnings for the first quarter ended March 30, 2003.
Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $953,162,000 compared with
$988,506,000 for the first quarter of 2002. Net income was $97,558,000, or $.73
per share-diluted, compared with $87,045,000, or $.63 per share-diluted, in the
first quarter of 2002. Excluding a one-time business realignment charge of $9.0
million pre-tax, net income for the first quarter of 2002 was $92,743,000, or
$.67 per share-diluted. On this more comparable basis, 2003 earnings per
share-diluted increased by 9.0 percent.

                                     -more-
<PAGE>

This quarter's earnings increase was achieved despite the fact that the Company
increased its bad debt reserve by $5.0 million (pre-tax), or two cents per
share-diluted, as its best estimate of possible exposure to the Fleming
bankruptcy announced on April 1, 2003.

Hershey's first quarter sales for 2003 were essentially flat on a comparable
basis as a result of the buy-in associated with the price increase announced in
December 2002 and continued rationalization of the Company's product line. Gross
margin expanded as a result of improved pricing, product and channel mix, supply
chain savings, and lower raw ingredient and packaging costs. Selling, marketing
and administrative expenses were also lower in the quarter, despite the
provision for the Fleming bankruptcy.

"Our performance during the quarter was in line with expectations, despite a
challenging retail environment," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer. "Profitability and margins increased through a
combination of better sales mix and on-going productivity gains. Equally as
important, Hershey's market leadership position strengthened with solid gains
driven by new products, more effective advertising and continued growth within
convenience stores. We look forward to building momentum during the balance of
2003 behind our value-enhancing strategy.

                                     -more-
<PAGE>
In this regard, our sales expectations for the year are 2-3 percent growth on a
comparable basis. In addition, we continue to expect earnings growth in the 9-11
percent range for 2003."
