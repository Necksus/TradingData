<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December 12, 2005, The Hershey Company (the &#147;Company&#148;) announced that it had
entered into an agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) with Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee
for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the &#147;Milton Hershey School Trust&#148;),
dated December 12, 2005, under which the Milton Hershey School Trust intends to
participate on a proportional basis in plans approved by the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors (&#147;Board&#148;) to repurchase the Company&#146;s outstanding Common Stock,
par value one dollar per share (&#147;Common Stock&#148;). The Board had approved the
repurchase of $250 million of its Common Stock in April 2005, and on December 6, 2005
approved the repurchase of an additional $500 million of its Common Stock. The Company
expects to complete both authorizations by the end of 2006. The initial term of the
Agreement will commence on December 13, 2005, and will expire on January 30, 2006 (the
&#147;Term&#148;). The parties, by mutual consent, may renew the Agreement for subsequent
additional terms. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the terms of the Agreement, the Milton Hershey School Trust will sell to the Company on a
weekly basis during the Term the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock the Company has purchased on the open
market from persons other than the Milton Hershey School Trust during the preceding
calendar week (the &#147;Prior Week Shares&#148;) multiplied by .44. The purchase price
for each weekly purchase will be the volume weighted average price (&#147;VWAP&#148;) paid
by the Company for the Prior Week Shares. The VWAP is calculated by dividing the total
consideration paid by the Company, without taking commissions into account, for the Prior
Week Shares by the Prior Week Shares, excluding any transaction involving the purchase of
shares of Common Stock directly from affiliates of the Company. The Milton Hershey School
Trust is not required to sell shares to the Company if the VWAP for the shares for such
week is less than $55 per share. </FONT></P>

the full-year 2005, stating that net sales will increase at a rate above the long-term
goal of 3-4 percent, and diluted earnings per share from operations should increase at a
rate greater than the long-term range of 9-11 percent. </FONT></P>

growth in key global markets. To support these growth initiatives, Hershey will provide a
comprehensive review of productivity and cost savings efforts which will be implemented in
2006 and beyond. In this context the Company will reaffirm its expectations for 2006,
calling for sales growth somewhat above its 3-4 percent long-term goal, with increased

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Based on current estimates, the cost
to implement the current business realignment program will result in total pre-tax charges
of approximately $140 million to $150 million, or $.41 to $.44 per share-diluted on an
after-tax basis. Approximately 90 percent of the charge will be recorded in the second
half of 2005, with the remainder recorded in the first half of 2006. </FONT></P>
