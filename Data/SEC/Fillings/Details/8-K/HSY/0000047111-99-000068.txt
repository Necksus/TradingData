                  Hershey Foods First Quarter Pre-Announcement

Hershey,  Pa. - Hershey Foods Corporation  announced today that its earnings for
the first  quarter  ending April 4, 1999,  excluding the gain on the sale of its
pasta  business,  may be below market  expectations  by  approximately  $.03 per
share. The corporation cited softness in its domestic confectionery sales as the
primary reason for the shortfall.

"While we expected  lower sales and earnings as a result of the  divestiture  of
our pasta  business,  as well as  difficult  sales  volume  comparisons  for our
domestic confectionery business compared to a very strong first quarter in 1998,
the earlier Easter and lower sales of our high profit  standard bars  compounded
the situation,"  said Kenneth L. Wolfe,  Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer.
"Hershey's  retail  sales growth  continued  to outpace the category  during the
first  quarter,  but our factory  shipments  during the period did not keep pace
because of timing of product  shipments to retailers.  The lower sales impact in
the first  quarter of 1999 was offset  somewhat  by cost  reductions,  including
further  changes in our retiree  medical  programs.  During the remainder of the
year,  we expect  confectionery  sales  increases  more in line with our  retail
movement and continued  cost  improvements  to result in another record year for
Hershey Foods."
