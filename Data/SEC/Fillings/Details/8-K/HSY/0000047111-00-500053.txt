      William F. Christ Named Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
        Officer, Hershey Foods Corporation


Kenneth  L.  Wolfe,   Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,   Hershey  Foods
Corporation,  today  announced  that William F. Christ has been named  Executive
Vice  President and Chief  Operating  Officer of the  Corporation.  In a related
announcement,  Frank  Cerminara  has  been  named  to  succeed  Christ  as  Vice
President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Hershey Foods Corporation.

Christ replaces Michael F. Pasquale, who has resigned. Pasquale's resignation is
unrelated to the financial  performance of the  Corporation,  which continues to
point to a good finish for the year.

In making this  announcement,  Wolfe said,  "I am very pleased to announce  Bill
Christ's  appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief  Operating  Officer.
Bill brings a wide range of  experience  as well as the respect of the financial
community  and our  customers to this  position.  With our  performance  in 2000
continuing to progress  well and our future  looking  bright,  Bill brings solid
leadership  skills as well as broad  experience  and  in-depth  knowledge of our
business to the task of leading our company forward."

Christ, a 31-year veteran of Hershey Foods,  most recently served as Senior Vice
President,  Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Corporation.  He joined
Hershey Foods in 1969 and worked in a succession of finance positions, including
Vice  President,  Finance  and  Administration,  in  the  Corporation's  Hershey
Chocolate  U.S.A.  and  Hershey  International   divisions.   Christ  was  named
President,  Hershey International,  in 1988 and became Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, Hershey Foods Corporation, in 1994, adding the position
of Corporate Treasurer in 1997.
