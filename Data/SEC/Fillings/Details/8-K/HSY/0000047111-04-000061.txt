                 HERSHEY FOODS TO INTRODUCE FIRST NUTRITION BARS
                WITH DR. BARRY SEARS' ZONE DIET SEAL OF APPROVAL


HERSHEY, Pa., February 9, 2004 - Hershey Foods Corporation and Dr. Barry Sears
today announced plans to introduce the first-ever nutrition bars with the
science-based nutritional benefits of the Zone Diet and the great taste
consumers expect from Hershey. The products will be the first to carry the "Dr.
Sears Zone Approval" seal and will be introduced during the third quarter.

 "Our new partnership with Dr. Sears is an outstanding match of Hershey's strong
brand-building and business-system capabilities with his world-renowned dietary
expertise," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Hershey Foods Corporation. "Together, we'll create innovative new
products that deliver the superior nutritional benefits of his Zone Diet and the
great taste consumers expect from Hershey. This is an exciting opportunity for
us as we further expand our presence in the nutrition snack segment and work
with Dr. Sears to meet the growing consumer demand for sound nutrition,
convenience and a healthy lifestyle."

"Good nutrition is the foundation not only for feeling and performing at your
best, but also for better health," said Dr. Barry Sears, Founder and President
of Zone Labs. "The innovative products to be developed through this new
partnership will provide a fusion of my Zone technology with the outstanding
food technology expertise of Hershey Foods. Due to the unique formulation of
these products, they will help stabilize blood sugar levels, which is the key to
controlling hunger and thus keeping weight in a healthy range. I'm extremely
proud to be associated with Hershey, a true leader in product innovation with an
outstanding ability to deliver taste and convenience to the marketplace.

Building upon the science-based principles of my Zone Diet, we'll be able to
give consumers both the great taste and balanced nutrition they want for a
healthy lifestyle."

Dr. Sears is one of the world's leading experts on nutrition. A former research
scientist at Boston University School of Medicine and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, he holds 13 US patents in the areas of drug-delivery
systems and dietary control of hormonal response. In 1995, he first published
his insights into hormonal effects of food in his landmark book, THE ZONE, which
became a New York Times #1 best seller. He since has published nine additional
books on his Zone dietary technology, which have been translated into 22
languages in 40 countries. Zone Labs provides research and development support
for Dr. Sears' effort to bring evidence-based nutrition products to consumers.
