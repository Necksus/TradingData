<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>HERSHEY, Pa., October 16, 2003
&#151; </B>Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today announced record sales and earnings
for the third quarter ended September 28, 2003. Consolidated net sales were $1,191,019,000
compared with $1,152,321,000 for the third quarter of 2002. Net income for the third
quarter of 2003 was $143,604,000, or $1.09 per share-diluted, compared with $123,065,000,
or $.89 per share-diluted, for the comparable period of 2002. This strong performance
reflected increased sales, improved margins, and higher returns for the business. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net income for the third quarter of
2003 includes an after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $.06 per share-diluted, associated
with the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the Company&#146;s leases of
certain warehouse and distribution facilities. The GAAP results also include pre-tax charges
related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives of $9.7 million, or $.04
per share-diluted, and a gain on the sale of several gum brands of $8.3 million, or $.04
per share-diluted, in the third quarter of 2003. </FONT></P>

Excluding these charges and the gain on the sale of the gum brands, income for the third
quarter of 2003 was $151,047,000, or $1.15 per share-diluted, compared with $139,809,000,

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company uses income before
accounting changes, excluding charges related to business rationalization and realignment
initiatives, the gain or loss on the sale of brands, and incremental, one-time charges
such as those incurred to explore the sale of the Company, as shown in the attached pro
forma income statements, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes
of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace
the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company
believes the presentation of earnings excluding such charges and gains or losses provides
additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present
operations, excluding items which the Company does not believe are indicative of its
ongoing operations. </FONT></P>

product rationalization initiatives and realignment of the sales organization are

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Hershey&#146;s third quarter sales
increased by 3.4 percent, reflecting sales of instant consumables spurred by the Limited
Edition Reese&#146;s products, as well as the impact of the price increase announced in
December 2002, partially offset by brand and product rationalization. Gross margin
expanded as a result of pricing and mix, and supply chain savings, especially lower
logistics costs. Selling, Marketing, and Administrative costs increased primarily as a
result of higher marketing spending. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;I&#146;m particularly pleased
with Hershey&#146;s third quarter results,&#148; said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman,
President, and Chief Executive Officer. &#147;This performance underscores the momentum
that we&#146;re gaining behind our value-enhancing strategy. During the quarter, we
delivered solid sales and market share growth as we continue to reshape our product and
brand portfolio. Equally as important, on-going productivity gains are providing the
appropriate level of investment in both consumer and customer initiatives. </FONT></P>
