Material Definitive Agreement </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November 2004, The Hershey Company (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a five year
credit agreement (the &#147;Five Year Credit Agreement&#148;) with banks, financial
institutions and other institutional lenders (collectively the &#147;Lenders&#148;) more
fully described in the Company&#146;s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed November 16, 2004.
The Five Year Credit Agreement established an unsecured revolving credit facility under
which the Company may borrow up to $900 million with the option to increase borrowings by
an additional $600 million with the concurrence of the Lenders. Funds borrowed
(&#147;Borrowings&#148;) may be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial
paper backstop. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
September 2005, Borrowings under the Five Year Credit Agreement (exclusively in the form
of commercial paper backstop) approached $900 million. Due to the pending retirement of
the Company&#146;s $200 million 6.70% notes due October 1, 2005, a recent contribution to
the Company&#146;s pension plans and seasonal working capital needs, the Company currently
expects Borrowings (again, exclusively in the form of commercial paper backstop) to exceed
$900 million for a short period of time beginning early October 2005
and ending on December 30, 2005. In lieu of increasing the borrowing limit under the Five
Year Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a new short-term credit agreement (the
&#147;Short-Term Credit Agreement&#148;) on September 23, 2005 with the banks, financial
institutions and other institutional lenders listed on the signature pages thereof
(collectively the &#147;New Facility Lenders&#148;), Citibank, N.A., as administrative
agent for the New Facility Lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, UBS Loan
Finance LLC, as documentation agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Banc of America
Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers. The Short-Term Credit
Agreement establishes an unsecured revolving credit facility under which the Company may
borrow up to $300 million. Funds borrowed may be used for general corporate purposes,
including commercial paper backstop. Advances other than competitive bid advances may be
repaid without penalty at any time prior to the last day of the Agreement. Competitive bid
advances must be paid at maturity, and may not be prepaid. The Credit Agreement contains a
financial covenant whereby the ratio of (a) pre-tax income from continuing operations from
the most recent four fiscal quarters to (b) consolidated interest expense for the most
recent four fiscal quarters may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal
quarter. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events
of default. Payment of outstanding advances may be accelerated, at the option of the New
Facility Lenders, should the Company default in its obligations under the Short-Term
Credit Agreement. The Short-Term Credit Agreement will expire on December&nbsp;30, 2005. A
copy of the Short-Term Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is
incorporated herein by reference. </FONT></P>

Lenders are Lenders under the Five Year Credit Agreement along with six other banking
