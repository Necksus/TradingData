                             HERSHEY FOODS ANNOUNCES
                             FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS

                            RECORD SALES AND EARNINGS
                                 FROM OPERATIONS



HERSHEY,  PA --- Hershey Foods Corporation  today announced record  consolidated
net sales and earnings from operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31,
1996.

Record net sales were $1,189,115,000 compared with $1,119,851,000 for the fourth
quarter of 1995. Net income was  $78,654,000,  or $.51 per share on a post-split
basis,  including a before- and after-tax  loss on disposal of certain  European
businesses of  $35,352,000,  or $.23 per share.  Excluding the loss on disposal,
net income for the  quarter  was  $114,006,000,  or $.74 per share,  compared to
$105,836,000, or $.68 per share, in 1995. Weighted average shares outstanding on
a post-split basis for the fourth quarter of 1996 were 153,368,000 compared with
154,669,000 for the fourth quarter of 1995.

Record net sales for the year were  $3,989,308,000  compared with $3,690,667,000
in  1995.   Net  income  for  the  year  including  the  loss  on  disposal  was
$273,186,000, or $1.77 per share.

                                      - 2 -

Excluding the impact of the loss on disposal,  net income was  $308,538,000,  or
$2.00 per  share,  compared  with  $281,919,000,  or $1.70 per  share,  in 1995.
Weighted average shares outstanding on a post-split basis for the full year 1996
were 153,995,000 compared with 165,687,000 for the full year 1995.

"We had a good  finish to 1996,"  said  Kenneth  L.  Wolfe,  Chairman  and Chief
Executive  Officer.  "In the fourth  quarter,  Hershey  Chocolate  North America
achieved  solid  volume  growth on the  strength of our  successful  new product
introductions and fine seasonal performance. Hershey Chocolate North America was
the principal  contributor to growth in earnings from operations in the quarter,
although  Hershey  Pasta  and  Hershey  International  also  recorded  excellent
earnings  increases  versus  last year.  Lower net  interest  expense  and fewer
average shares  outstanding  also  contributed to per share net income growth in
the quarter.

"Sales growth for the year was  attributable  primarily to volume growth related
to new  products  such as  Hershey's  Sweet  Escapes  reduced  fat  and  calorie
chocolate bar, Hershey's TasteTations hard candies,  Hershey's Pot of Gold boxed
chocolates  and  Hershey's  Cookies 'n Creme  candy bars,  as well as  excellent
seasonal  business,  the price increase,  and the acquisition of the Henry Heide
Inc. In addition,  Hershey Grocery and Hershey  International posted solid sales
gains  for the year.  These  gains  were  offset  somewhat  by the  disposal  of
businesses in Canada and Europe, and lower sales for Hershey Pasta Group.

"Hershey Chocolate North America was the principal  contributor to income growth
for the year with  important  contributions  also made by  Hershey  Grocery  and
Hershey  International.  Net interest expense increased for the year as a result
of the  increased  level of  borrowings.  The  lower  number of  average  shares
outstanding for the year contributed to net earnings per share growth.

"We had an  excellent  year in  1996,  and our  business  enters  1997 on  solid
footing.  Newly acquired Leaf North America will require  considerable  time and
effort to integrate with our North  American  confectionery  business.  While we
initially  will  have  modest  earnings  dilution,   we  are  confident  we  can
significantly improve the operating performance of this business.  Meanwhile, we
will continue to introduce  exciting new products while  continuing to invest in
our core  businesses.  There  is a lot to be  accomplished  in 1997,  but we are
confident that Hershey's team is up to the task," Wolfe concluded.
