          Hershey Foods Corporation Does Not Endorse Mini-Tender Offer

HERSHEY, Pa, August 8, 2002 - Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today
announced that it received notification that TRC Capital Corporation commenced
an unsolicited mini-tender offer to purchase up to 1,750,000 common shares, or
approximately 1.64% of Hershey's outstanding common shares, at a price of $70.25
per share. Hershey cautions stockholders that the offer is being made at a
discount to the closing price of $71.89 per share for the company's shares on
the day before Hershey was informed of the offer and to today's closing price of
$74.09.

Hershey wishes to inform its stockholders that it strongly recommends rejection
of this unsolicited offer and that the company is in no way associated with TRC
Capital.

Stockholders also are advised that TRC Capital does not currently have the
financial resources to complete the offer which is conditioned, among other
things, on receipt by TRC Capital of such financing and that TRC Capital has
reserved the right to withdraw its offer at any time, at its sole discretion.

"Mini tender" offers seek less than 5% of a company's stock, thereby avoiding
many disclosure and procedural requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The SEC has issued an investor alert regarding "mini tender" offers
on its website at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. The SEC has said that
mini-tender offers "have been increasingly used to catch investors off guard"
and that investors "may end up selling their securities at below-market prices."

Stockholders are advised to consult with their investment advisors and to
exercise caution with respect to this offer.

This release contains statements which are forward-looking. These statements are
made based upon current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty.
Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements. Factors which could cause results to differ materially include, but
are not limited to: changes in the confectionery and grocery business

associated with the Company's distribution operations; pension cost factors,
such as actuarial assumptions and employee retirement decisions; and the
Company's ability to sell certain assets at targeted values, as discussed in the
Company's annual report on Form 10-K for 2001.

                                                                 # # #
