writing, or telecopier or telex in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto,
specifying  therein the requested (w) date of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,

amount of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,  and (z) in the case of a Revolving

Applicable  Lending  Office to the  Agent at the  Agent's  Account,  in same day
funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit  Borrowing.  After
the  Agent's  receipt  of such  funds  and upon  fulfillment  of the  applicable
conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to
the Borrower  requesting the Revolving  Credit  Borrowing at the Agent's address
referred to in Section 9.02.

                  (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,a Borrower
may not select  Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Revolving  Credit  Borrowing if
the  obligation of the Lenders to make  Eurodollar  Rate Advances  shall then be
suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12.

                  (c) Each Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing of any Borrower
shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower.  In the case of any Revolving
Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies
is to be comprised of Eurodollar  Rate Advances,  the Borrower  requesting  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall  indemnify  each Lender,  after receipt of a
written request by such Lender setting forth in reasonable  detail the basis for
such request, against any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by such Lender
as a result of any  failure  by such  Borrower  to fulfill on or before the date
specified in such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing for such Revolving Credit
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without
limitation,  any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits),  cost or expense
actually  incurred by reason of the  liquidation or  reemployment of deposits or

<PAGE>

                                       15


other funds  acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving  Credit Advance to be
made  by such  Lender  as part of such  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  when  such
Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

                  (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate
Advances  or prior to the time of the  proposed  disbursement  of any  Revolving
Credit Borrowing  comprised of Base Rate Advances that such Lender will not make
available to the Agent such Lender's  ratable  portion of such Revolving  Credit
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Agent on the date of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in accordance with
subsection  (a) of this  Section  2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance  upon such
assumption,  make available to the Borrower  requesting  such  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing on such date a  corresponding  amount.  If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion  available to the Agent, such
Lender and such  Borrower  severally  agree to repay to the Agent  forthwith  on
demand such  corresponding  amount together with interest thereon,  for each day
from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest
rate  applicable  at the  time to  Revolving  Credit  Advances  comprising  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of such  Lender,  the Federal
Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such  corresponding  amount,
such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as
part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit
Advance to be made by it as part of any  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall not
relieve  any  other  Lender of its  obligation,  if any,  hereunder  to make its
Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing,  but no
Lender  shall be  responsible  for the  failure of any other  Lender to make the
Revolving  Credit  Advance  to be made by such  other  Lender on the date of any
Revolving Credit Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.03. THE COMPETITIVE BID ADVANCES. (a) Each Lender

     the date occurring 7 days after the date of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing

     proposed  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  if such Borrower shall specify in the
     Notice  of  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  that the rates of  interest  to be

     comprising any such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing being referred to herein as
     "Fixed Rate  Advances")  and (B) at least four  Business  Days prior to the
     date of the proposed  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,  if such Borrower  shall
     instead  specify in the Notice of Competitive  Bid Borrowing that the rates
     of  interest  to be offered by the Lenders are to be based on the LIBO Rate
     (the Advances  comprising such  Competitive Bid Borrowing being referred to

     notify each Lender of each request for a Competitive Bid Borrowing received
     by it from a Borrower by sending  such Lender a copy of the related  Notice
     of Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                  (ii)     Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it
     elects  to do so,  irrevocably  offer to make one or more  Competitive  Bid
     Advances to the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing as part of
     such  proposed  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  at a rate or rates of interest
     specified by such Lender in its sole  discretion,  by  notifying  the Agent
     (which shall give prompt notice thereof to such Borrower), before 9:30 A.M.
     (New  York  City  time)  on the  date  of  such  proposed  Competitive  Bid
     Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing  consisting of Fixed
     Rate  Advances  and before 10:00 A.M.  (New York City time) three  Business
     Days before the date of such proposed  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,  in the
     case of a Competitive  Bid Borrowing  consisting of LIBO Rate Advances,  of
     the minimum amount and maximum amount of each Competitive Bid Advance which
     such Lender would be willing to make as part of such  proposed  Competitive
     Bid  Borrowing  (which  amounts  may,  subject to the  proviso to the first
     sentence of this Section 2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment, if any),
     the rate or rates of interest therefor and such Lender's Applicable Lending
     Office with respect to such  Competitive Bid Advance;  provided that if the
     Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall, in its sole  discretion,  elect to
     make any such offer,  it shall notify such  Borrower of such offer at least
     30 minutes before the time and on the date on which notice of such election
     is to be given to the Agent by the other Lenders. If any Lender shall elect
     not to make such an offer,  such Lender  shall so notify the Agent,  before
     10:00  A.M.  (New  York  City  time) on the date on  which  notice  of such
     election is to be given to the Agent by the other Lenders,  and such Lender
     shall not be obligated to, and shall not, make any  Competitive Bid Advance

     Lender to give such notice  shall not cause such Lender to be  obligated to

                  (iii)    The Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing
     shall, in turn,  before 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such
     proposed  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,  in the  case of a  Competitive  Bid
     Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances and before 11:00 A.M. (New York
     City time) three Business Days before the date of such proposed Competitive
     Bid  Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive  Bid Borrowing  consisting of
     LIBO Rate Advances, either:

                           (x) cancel such Competitive Bid Borrowing by giving
                  the Agent notice to that effect, or

                           (y) accept one or more of the offers made by any
                  Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its
                  sole discretion, by giving notice to the Agent of the amount
                  of each Competitive Bid Advance (which amount shall be equal
                  to or greater than the minimum amount, and equal to or less
                  than the maximum amount, notified to such Borrower by the
                  Agent on behalf of such Lender for such Competitive Bid
                  Advance pursuant to paragraph (ii) above) to be made by each
                  Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, and reject
                  any remaining offers made by Lenders pursuant to paragraph
                  (ii) above by giving the Agent notice to that effect;
                  provided, however, that such Borrower shall not accept any
                  offer in excess of the requested bid amount for any maturity.
                  Such Borrower shall accept the offers made by any Lender or
                  Lenders to make Competitive Bid Advances in order of the
                  lowest to the highest rates of interest offered by such
                  Lenders. If two or more Lenders have offered the same interest
                  rate, the amount to be borrowed at such interest rate will be
                  allocated among such Lenders in proportion to the amount that
                  each such Lender offered at such interest rate.

                  (iv)     If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
     notifies the Agent that such Competitive Bid Borrowing is cancelled
     pursuant to paragraph  (iii)(x)  above,  the Agent shall give prompt notice
     thereof to the  Lenders and such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  shall not be
     made.

                  (v)      If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
     accepts one or more of the offers made by any Lender or Lenders pursuant to
     paragraph  (iii)(y) above, the Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each
     Lender that has made an offer as described in paragraph (ii) above,  of the
     date and aggregate  amount of such Competitive Bid Borrowing and whether or
     not any offer or offers made by such  Lender  pursuant  to  paragraph  (ii)
     above have been accepted by such Borrower,  (B) each Lender that is to make
     a Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, of the
     amount of each Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as part of
     such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,  and (C) each  Lender  that is to make a
     Competitive  Bid Advance as part of such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing,  upon
     receipt,  that the Agent  has  received  forms of  documents  appearing  to
     fulfill the  applicable  conditions  set forth in Article III.  Each Lender
     that is to make a Competitive  Bid Advance as part of such  Competitive Bid
     Borrowing shall, before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of such
     Competitive  Bid Borrowing  specified in the notice received from the Agent
     pursuant  to clause (A) of the  preceding  sentence  or any later time when
     such Lender shall

     have received notice from the Agent pursuant to clause (C) of the preceding
     sentence,  make available for the account of its Applicable  Lending Office
     to the Agent at the  Agent's  Account,  in same day  funds,  such  Lender's
     portion  of  such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing.  Upon  fulfillment  of  the
     applicable  conditions  set forth in Article  III and after  receipt by the
     Agent of such  funds,  the Agent  will make such  funds  available  to such
     Borrower at the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.02. Promptly after
     each  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  the Agent will notify each Lender of the
     amount of the  Competitive  Bid Borrowing,  the consequent  Competitive Bid
     Reduction and the dates upon which such Competitive Bid Reduction commenced
     and will terminate.

                  (vi)     If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
     notifies  the Agent that it accepts  one or more of the offers  made by any
     Lender or Lenders  pursuant to  paragraph  (iii)(y)  above,  such notice of
     acceptance shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower. Such Borrower
     shall  indemnify  each Lender,  after receipt of a written  request by such
     Lender  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail  the basis for such  request,
     against  any loss,  cost or expense  actually  incurred by such Lender as a
     result of any  failure  by such  Borrower  to fulfill on or before the date
     specified  in the related  Notice of  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  for such
     Competitive  Bid Borrowing the  applicable  conditions set forth in Article
     III,  including,   without  limitation,   any  loss  (other  than  loss  of
     anticipated  profits),  cost or expense actually  incurred by reason of the
     liquidation  or  reemployment  of deposits or other funds  acquired by such
     Lender to fund the  Competitive  Bid  Advance to be made by such  Lender as
     part of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing when such  Competitive Bid Advance,
     as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

                  (b)  Each  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  shall  be  in  an
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof  and,  following  the  making of each  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,  the
Borrower that has borrowed  through such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing shall be in
compliance with the limitation set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of
subsection  (a) above.


                   (c) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in
this Section 2.03, each Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section
2.03,  repay or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this
Section 2.03.

                  (d)      Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive
Bid  Borrowing  shall repay to the Agent for the account of each Lender that has
made a Competitive  Bid Advance,  on the maturity date of such  Competitive  Bid
Advance (such  maturity date being that specified by such Borrower for repayment
of such  Competitive  Bid  Advance  in the  related  Notice of  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing  delivered  pursuant to  subsection  (a)(i)  above and provided in the
Competitive Bid Note evidencing such  Competitive Bid Advance),  the then unpaid
principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance. A Borrower shall have no right
to prepay any  principal  amount of any  Competitive  Bid  Advance  without  the
consent  of the  Lender  that has made such  Competitive  Bid  Advance  or as is
specified in the Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                  (e)      Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive
Bid  Borrowing  shall  pay  interest  on the  unpaid  principal  amount  of each
Competitive Bid Advance from the date of such Competitive Bid Advance comprising
such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  to the  date  the  principal  amount  of such
Competitive  Bid  Advance is repaid in full,  at the rate of  interest  for such
Competitive  Bid Advance  specified by the Lender  making such  Competitive  Bid
Advance in its notice with  respect  thereto  delivered  pursuant to  subsection
(a)(ii) above,  payable on the interest  payment date or dates specified by such
Borrower for such  Competitive  Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive
Bid Borrowing  delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as provided in the
Competitive  Bid  Note  evidencing  such  Competitive  Bid  Advance.   Upon  the
occurrence  and during the  continuance  of an Event of  Default  under  Section
6.01(a),  each  Borrower that has borrowed  though a  Competitive  Bid Borrowing
shall pay  interest on the amount of unpaid  principal  of and  interest on each
Competitive Bid Advance  comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing that is owing
to a  Lender,  payable  in  arrears  on the date or dates  interest  is  payable
thereon,  at a rate per annum  equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate
per annum required to be paid on such Competitive Bid Advance under the terms of
the  Competitive  Bid  Note  evidencing  such  Competitive  Bid  Advance  unless
otherwise agreed in such Competitive Bid Note.

                  (f)      The indebtedness of any Borrower resulting from each
Competitive  Bid  Advance  made to such  Borrower as part of a  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing shall be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of such Borrower
payable to the order of the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.

                  SECTION 2.04. FEES. (a) FACILITY FEE. The Company agrees to

aggregate amount of such Lender's Commitment from the date hereof in the case of
each Initial  Lender and from the  effective  date  specified in the  Assumption
Agreement or the  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  as the case may be,  pursuant to
which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the  Termination
Date at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable  Percentage in effect from time
to time,  payable  in arrears  quarterly  on the last day of each  March,  June,
September and December,  commencing  September 30, 2004, and on the  Termination

COMMITMENTS.  (A) TERMINATION OR RATABLE  REDUCTION BY THE COMPANY.  The Company
shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to

respective  Commitments  of the Lenders,  provided  that each partial  reduction
shall be in the  aggregate  amount of  $10,000,000  or an  integral  multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and provided, further, that the aggregate amount of
the  Commitments  of the Lenders  shall not be reduced to an amount that is less
than the  aggregate  principal  amount  of the  Competitive  Bid  Advances  then

                  (b)  TERMINATION  BY THE MAJORITY  LENDERS UPON CHANGE OF
CONTROL.  In the event that a Change of Control  occurs,  (i) the Agent shall at
the request,  or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the
Company  given not later than 10 Business  Days after receipt by the Lenders and
the Agent of notice  from the  Company  of such  Change of Control  pursuant  to
Section 5.01(h)(iv),  declare the Commitments  (determined without giving effect
to any Competitive Bid Reduction) to be terminated in whole, effective as of the
date set forth in such  notice,  provided,  however,  that such date shall be no
earlier  than 10  Business  Days after the  Company's  receipt of such notice of
termination  and (ii)  each  Borrower's  right to make a  Borrowing  under  this
Agreement  shall  thereupon be suspended  and shall  remain  suspended  until 10
Business  Days after  receipt by the  Lenders  and the Agent of notice  from the
Company of such  Change of Control  pursuant to Section  5.01(h)(iv)  unless the
Majority  Lenders shall have exercised  their right to terminate the Commitments
as provided in clause (i) of this Section 2.05(b), in which case each Borrower's
right to make a Borrowing under this Agreement shall remain  suspended until the
effective date of such  termination.  A notice of  termination  pursuant to this
Section 2.05(b) shall have the effect of accelerating  the outstanding  Advances
of the Lenders and the Notes of the Lenders and each Borrower shall, on or prior
to the effective date of the termination of the Commitments,  prepay or cause to
be prepaid the  outstanding  principal  amount of all Advances owing by any such
Borrower to the Lenders,  together with accrued  interest thereon to the date of
such payment, any facility fees or other fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to
the  provisions  of Section 2.04,  and all other amounts  payable to the Lenders
under this  Agreement  (including,  but not limited to, any  increased  costs or
other amounts owing under Section 2.11 and any  indemnification  for Taxes under
Section 2.14).  Upon such  prepayment and the  termination of the Commitments in
accordance with this Section 2.05(b),  the obligations of the Lenders under this
Agreement shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged.

                  (c) INCREASE BY THE COMPANY. (i) The Company may at any time,
by notice to the Agent,  propose that the aggregate amount of the Commitments be
increased (each such proposed  increase being a "Commitment  Increase") by up to
$300,000,000  in excess of the aggregate of the  Commitments as of the Effective
Date,  effective  as at a date (the  "Commitment  Increase  Date") that shall be
specified in such notice and that shall be (A) prior to the Termination Date and
(B) at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice; provided,  however,
that (w) the Company may not propose more than one  Commitment  Increase  during
any  calendar  year,  (x) the  minimum  proposed  Commitment  Increase  for each
Commitment  Increase  Date  shall  be  $50,000,000,  (y) in no event  shall  the
aggregate  amount of the Commitments at any time exceed  $800,000,000 and (z) no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such  Commitment  Increase Date
or shall  result  from such  Commitment  Increase.  The Agent  shall  notify the
Lenders and any Eligible  Assignees  requested by the Company and  acceptable to
the Agent as potential  Assuming  Lenders  hereunder of the proposed  Commitment
Increase  promptly upon the Agent's  receipt of any such notice.  It shall be in
each Lender's sole  discretion  whether to increase its Commitment  hereunder in
connection with the proposed Commitment Increase. No later than 10 Business Days
after its  receipt  of the  Company's  notice,  each  Lender  that is willing to
increase  its  Commitment  hereunder  (each  such  Lender  being an  "Increasing
Lender")  shall  deliver  to the Agent a notice in which such  Lender  shall set
forth the maximum  increase in its Commitment to which such Lender is willing to
agree,  and the  Agent  shall  promptly  provide  to the  Company a copy of such
Increasing  Lender's  notice.  The Agent  shall  cooperate  with the  Company in
discussions with the Lenders and Eligible Assignees with a view to arranging the
proposed  Commitment  Increase through the increase of the Commitments


<PAGE>
                                       21

of one or  more of the  Lenders  and/or  the  addition  of one or more  Eligible
Assignees  acceptable  to the Company  and the Agent as Assuming  Lenders and as
parties to this Agreement;  provided, however,  that the minimum  Commitment of
each such  Assuming  Lender that becomes a party to this  Agreement  pursuant to
this  Section  2.05(c)  shall be  $10,000,000;  and  provided  further that any
allocations of Commitments shall be determined by the Company.



                  (ii) If agreement is reached prior to the relevant Commitment
Increase  Date  with  any  Increasing  Lenders  and  Assuming  Lenders  as  to a
Commitment  Increase  (the  amount  of which may be less  than  (subject  to the
limitation  set forth in clause (i)(x) of this Section  2.05(c)) but not greater
than that amount  specified  in the  applicable  notice from the  Company),  the
Company shall  deliver,  no later than one Business Day prior to the  Commitment
Increase Date, a notice thereof in reasonable detail to the Agent (and the Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Lenders,  including any Assuming Lenders).  The
Assuming  Lenders,  if any, shall become Lenders  hereunder as of the Commitment
Increase Date and the  Commitments of any  Increasing  Lenders and such Assuming
Lenders  shall become or be, as the case may be, as of the  Commitment  Increase
Date, the amounts specified in the notice delivered by the Company to the Agent;
provided, however, that:

                  (x) the Agent shall have received on or prior to 9:00 A.M.

         hereto for each Assuming Lender, and dated the date to which interest
         on the existing Revolving Credit Note of such Borrower shall have been
         paid and in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto for each
         Increasing Lender, in each case in an amount equal to the Commitment of
         each such Assuming Lender and each such Increasing Lender after giving
         effect to such Commitment Increase, (B) a certificate of a duly
         authorized officer of the Company stating that no event has occurred
         and is continuing, or would result from such Commitment Increase, that
         constitutes a Default, and that each of the other applicable conditions
         to such Commitment Increase set forth in this Section 2.05(c) to be
         fulfilled by the Company has been satisfied and (C) an opinion of
         counsel for the Company in substantially the form of Exhibit H
         hereto, dated the Commitment Increase Date (with copies for each
         Lender, including each Assuming Lender);

                  (y) with respect to each Assuming Lender, the Agent shall have
         received, on or prior to 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
         Commitment Increase Date, an appropriate Assumption Agreement in
         substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, duly executed by such
         Assuming Lender and the Company, and acknowledged by the Agent; and

                  (z) each Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Agent,
         on or prior to 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment
         Increase Date, (A) its existing Revolving Credit Note or Notes and (B)
         confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased
         Commitment, with a copy of such confirmation to the Company.

                  (iii) Upon its receipt of confirmation from a Lender that it
is increasing its Commitment  hereunder,  together with the appropriate
Revolving Credit  Note or Notes,

                                       22


certificate and opinion referred to in clause (ii)(x) above, the Agent shall (A)
record the  information  contained  therein in the  Register and (B) give prompt
notice  thereof to the  Company.  Upon its  receipt of an  Assumption  Agreement
executed by an Assuming  Lender  representing  that it is an Eligible  Assignee,
together with the appropriate  Revolving  Credit Note or Notes,  certificate and
opinion referred to in clause (ii)(x) above, the Agent shall, if such Assumption
Agreement  has been  completed  and is in  substantially  the form of  Exhibit D
hereto,  (x) accept  such  Assumption  Agreement,  (y)  record  the  information
contained  therein in the  Register  and (z) give prompt  notice  thereof to the
Company.

notice  from the  Company  as to such  agreement  on or prior to the  Commitment
Increase  Date or the  Company  shall,  by  notice  to the  Agent  prior  to the
Commitment Increase Date, withdraw its proposal for a Commitment Increase or any
of the actions  provided for above in clauses  (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) shall not
have occurred by 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment Increase Date,
such  proposal  by the  Company  shall be deemed not to have been made.  In such
event, any actions theretofore taken under clauses (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) above
shall be deemed to be of no effect  and all the rights  and  obligations  of the
parties shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.

                  (v) In the event that the Agent shall have received notice
from the Company as to such  agreement  on or prior to the  Commitment  Increase
Date and each of the actions  provided for in clauses  (ii)(x)  through  (ii)(z)
above shall have  occurred by 9:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the  Commitment
Increase  Date,  the Agent shall  notify the  Lenders  (including  any  Assuming
Lenders) of the occurrence of the  Commitment  Increase Date promptly and in any
event by 10:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on such date by  telecopier,  telex or
cable. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall,  before 11:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on the  Commitment  Increase  Date,  make available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in
same day funds,  in the case of such  Assuming  Lender,  an amount equal to such
Assuming  Lender's  ratable  portion of the  Revolving  Credit  Borrowings  then
outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase)
and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (i)
such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then
outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase)
over (ii) such  Increasing  Lender's  ratable  portion of the  Revolving  Credit
Borrowings then outstanding  (calculated based on its Commitment (without giving
effect to the relevant  Commitment  Increase) as a percentage  of the  aggregate
Commitments  without giving effect to the relevant Commitment  Increase).  After
the Agent's receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such
Assuming Lender, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like
funds to the  other  Lenders  for the  account  of their  respective  Applicable
Lending Offices in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount
of the outstanding  Revolving  Credit Advances owing to each Lender after giving
effect  to  such  distribution  equals  such  Lender's  ratable  portion  of the
Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding  (calculated based on such Lender's
Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving
effect to the relevant  Commitment  Increase).  If the Commitment  Increase Date
shall  occur on a date that is not the last day of the  Interest  Period for all
Eurodollar Rate Advances then outstanding, (a) the

<PAGE>
                                       23

Company shall pay any amounts owing  pursuant to Section  9.04(d) as a result of
the  distributions  to Lenders  under this Section  2.05(c)(v)  and (b) for each
Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the respective
Revolving  Credit  Advances  made by the  Increasing  Lenders  and the  Assuming
Lenders  pursuant to this Section  2.05(c)(v)  shall be Base Rate Advances until
the last day of the then  existing  Interest  Period for such  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.06. REPAYMENT OF REVOLVING CREDIT ADVANCES. Each
Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable  account of the Lenders on the
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances
then outstanding in respect of such Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.07. INTEREST ON REVOLVING CREDIT ADVANCES. (a)
SCHEDULED  INTEREST.  Each Borrower  shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal
amount of each  Revolving  Credit  Advance owing by such Borrower to each Lender
from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount shall
be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

                  (i)      BASE RATE ADVANCES. During such periods as such
         Revolving Credit Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal
         at all times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to
         time plus (y) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time plus
         (z) the Applicable Utilization Fee, if any, in effect from time to
         time,  payable in  arrears  quarterly  on the last day of each  March,
         June,  September and December during such periods and on the date such
         Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                  (ii)     EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES.  During such periods as
         such Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per
         annum  equal  at all  times  during  each  Interest  Period  for  such
         Revolving  Credit  Advance to the sum of (x) the  Eurodollar  Rate for
         such Interest  Period for such  Revolving  Credit Advance plus (y) the
         Applicable  Margin in effect from time to time plus (z) the Applicable
         Utilization  Fee,  if any,  in effect  from time to time,  payable  in
         arrears on the last day of such Interest  Period and, if such Interest
         Period has a  duration  of more than  three  months,  on each day that
         occurs during such  Interest  Period every three months from the first
         day of such  Interest  Period  and on the date  such  Eurodollar  Rate
         Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                  (b)      DEFAULT INTEREST. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance  of an Event of Default under Section  6.01(a),  each Borrower shall
pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance
owing by such Borrower to each Lender,  payable in arrears on the dates referred
to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above,  at a rate per annum equal at all times to
2% per  annum  above the rate per annum  required  to be paid on such  Revolving
Credit  Advance  pursuant  to  clause  (a)(i) or  (a)(ii)  above and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount
payable hereunder by such Borrower that is not paid when due, from the date such
amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full,  payable in arrears
on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum
equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum  required to be paid
on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

                                       24

                  (c)      ADDITIONAL INTEREST ON EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES. The
applicable  Borrower  shall pay to each Lender,  so long as such Lender shall be
required  under  regulations  of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve
System to maintain  reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of
or  including  Eurocurrency  Liabilities,  additional  interest  on  the  unpaid
principal  amount  of  each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance  of such  Lender  to such
Borrower,  from the date of such Advance until such principal  amount is paid in
full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained
by subtracting  (i) the Eurodollar  Rate for the applicable  Interest Period for
such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such  Eurodollar  Rate by a
percentage  equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar  Rate Reserve  Percentage of such
Lender  for such  Interest  Period,  payable on each date on which  interest  is
payable on such Advance.  Such  additional  interest shall be determined by such
Lender and notified in reasonable detail to such Borrower through the Agent.

                  SECTION 2.08. INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION. (a) Each Reference
Bank  agrees to  furnish  to the Agent  timely  information  for the  purpose of
determining  each  Eurodollar Rate and each LIBO Rate. If any one or more of the
Reference  Banks shall not furnish such timely  information to the Agent for the
purpose of determining  any such interest  rate, the Agent shall  determine such
interest  rate on the basis of timely  information  furnished  by the  remaining
Reference  Banks.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the relevant  Borrowers
and the Lenders of the  applicable  interest  rate  determined  by the Agent for
purposes of Section  2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by each
Reference  Bank for the purpose of  determining  the interest rate under Section
2.07(a)(ii).

                  (b)      If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
Majority  Lenders  notify the Agent that the  Eurodollar  Rate for any  Interest
Period for such Advances will not  adequately  reflect the cost to such Majority
Lenders of making,  funding or  maintaining  their  respective  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances  for such  Interest  Period  (which  cost each such  Lender  reasonably
determines in good faith is material),  the Agent shall forthwith so notify each
Borrower  and the  Lenders,  whereupon  (i) each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance will
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert  into a Base Rate  Advance,  and (ii) the  obligation  of the Lenders to
make, or to Convert  Revolving  Credit  Advances into,  Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders
that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  (c)      If any Borrower, in requesting a Revolving Credit
Borrowing  comprised  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  shall  fail to select the
duration of the Interest  Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance
with the provisions  contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section
1.01,  the Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such
Advances  will  automatically,  on the last day of the  then  existing  Interest
Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (d)      On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by
payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert into Base Rate Advances.

<PAGE>
                                       25

                  (e)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default,  (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will  automatically,  on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance and (ii) the  obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert  Advances
into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

                  (f)      If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely
information to the Agent for  determining  the Eurodollar  Rate or LIBO Rate for
any  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or LIBO Rate  Advances,  as the case may be, such
Eurodollar Rate or LIBO Rate shall be the interest rate per annum  determined by
the Agent to be the offered rate per annum at which deposits in U.S. dollars for
a maturity  comparable to the Interest  Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances
or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may be, appears on the Telerate Page 3750 (or
any  successor  page) as of 11:00 A.M.  (London time) two Business Days prior to
the first day of such  Interest  Period (the  "Telerate");  provided that if the
Telerate is not then available:

                  (i)      the Agent shall forthwith notify the relevant
         Borrower and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined
         for such  Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case
         may be;

                  (ii)     with respect to Eurodollar Rate Advances, each such
         Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing
         Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if such
         Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate
         Advance); and

                  (iii)    the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate
         Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances
         into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall
         notify each Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing
         such suspension no longer exist.

                  SECTION 2.09. OPTIONAL CONVERSION OF REVOLVING CREDIT
ADVANCES.  Any Borrower may on any Business  Day, upon notice given to the Agent
not later than 11:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the third  Business Day prior
to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections
2.08 and 2.12,  Convert all Revolving Credit Advances of one Type comprising the
same  Borrowing  into  Revolving  Credit  Advances of the other Type;  provided,
however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances
shall be made only on the last day of an  Interest  Period  for such  Eurodollar
Rate Advances.  Each such notice of a Conversion shall,  within the restrictions
specified  above,  specify (i) the date of such  Conversion,  (ii) the Revolving
Credit Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar
Rate  Advances,  the  duration  of the  initial  Interest  Period  for each such
Advance.  Each  notice of  Conversion  shall be  irrevocable  and binding on the
relevant Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.10. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT
ADVANCES.  Any Borrower  may, upon notice to the Agent stating the proposed date
and aggregate  principal  amount of the  prepayment,  given not later than 11:00
A.M.  (New York City time) on the second  Business Day prior to the date of such
proposed prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, and not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of such proposed  prepayment,  in the
case of Base Rate  Advances,  and, if such notice is given such Borrower  shall,

<PAGE>
                                       26

prepay  the  outstanding  principal  amount  of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
comprising  part of the same Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in whole or ratably in
part,  together  with  accrued  interest to the date of such  prepayment  on the
principal amount prepaid;  provided, however,  that (x) each partial prepayment
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance,  such  Borrower  shall be obligated to reimburse  the
Lenders  in  respect  thereof  pursuant  to  Section  9.04(d).  Each  notice  of
prepayment  by a Designated  Subsidiary  shall be given to the Agent through the
Company.

                  SECTION 2.11. INCREASED COSTS. (a) If, after the date hereof,
due to either (i) the  introduction  of or any change  (other than any change by
way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar
Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or
(ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  over any Lender  (whether  or not
having the force of law),  there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender
(which cost such Lender  reasonably  determines  in good faith is  material)  of
agreeing to make or making,  funding or maintaining  Eurodollar Rate Advances or
LIBO  Rate  Advances  (excluding  for  purposes  of this  Section  2.11 any such
increased  costs  resulting  from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which  Section
2.14 shall govern) and (ii) Excluded Taxes),  then the Borrower of such Advances
shall from time to time,  upon demand by such Lender made not later than 60 days
after such Lender obtains knowledge of such increased costs (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional
amounts  sufficient  to compensate  such Lender for such  increased  cost.  Each
Lender agrees that if such Lender  requests  compensation  for any amounts owing
from a Borrower for such increased cost under this Section 2.11(a),  such Lender
shall,  prior to a Borrower being required to pay such increased costs,  furnish
to such  Borrower a  certificate  of a senior  financial  officer of such Lender
verifying that such increased cost was actually  incurred by such Lender and the
amount of such increased  cost and setting forth in reasonable  detail the basis
therefore  (with a copy of such  certificate to the Agent);  provided, however,
that such certificate  shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,  absent
manifest error.

                  (b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender determines that
compliance  with any law or  regulation  or any  guideline  or request  from any
central bank or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over any Lender
(whether or not having the force of law)  affects or would  affect the amount of
capital  required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling  such Lender and that the amount of such  capital is increased by or
based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other
commitments of this type,  then,  upon demand by such Lender made not later than
60 days after such Lender obtains  knowledge of such increase in capital (with a
copy of such  demand to the Agent),  the Company  shall pay to the Agent for the
account  of  such  Lender,  from  time  to time  as  specified  by such  Lender,
additional  amounts  sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in
the light of such  circumstances,  to the  extent  that such  Lender  reasonably
determines  such  increase in capital to be allocable  to the  existence of such
Lender's  commitment to lend  hereunder.  Each Lender agrees that if such Lender
requests  compensation  for any amounts owing from the Company for such increase
in capital under this Section  2.11(b),  such Lender shall,  prior to a Borrower
being required to compensate  such Lender for such increase in capital,  furnish
to the  Company a  certificate  of a senior  financial  officer  of such  Lender
verifying that

<PAGE>
                                       27

such increase in capital was actually  required by such Lender and the amount of
such  increase  in capital  and  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail the basis
therefore  (with a copy of such  certificate to the Agent);  provided,  however,
that such certificate  shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,  absent
manifest error.

                  (c) No Borrower shall be obligated to pay under this Section
2.11 any amounts which relate to costs or increases of capital incurred prior to
the 12 months  immediately  preceding  the date of demand  for  payment  of such
amounts,  unless the applicable law, regulation,  guideline or request resulting
in such costs or increases of capital is imposed  retroactively.  In the case of
any law, regulation,  guideline or request which is imposed  retroactively,  the
Lender  making  demand for payment of any amount  under this  Section 2.11 shall
notify the  related  Borrower  not later than 12 months  from the date that such
Lender should reasonably have known (but promptly upon gaining knowledge of such
increase)  of such law,  regulation,  guideline  or request and such  Borrower's
obligation  to compensate  such Lender for such amount is  contingent  upon such
Lender's so notifying such Borrower; provided, however, that any failure by such
Lender to provide such notice shall not affect such Borrower's obligations under
this Section 2.11 with respect to amounts  resulting  from costs or increases of
capital incurred after the date which occurs 12 months immediately preceding the
date on which  such  Lender  notified  such  Borrower  of such law,  regulation,
guideline or request.

                  (d) If any Lender shall subsequently recoup any costs (other
than from a Borrower) for which such Lender has theretofore  been compensated by
a Borrower under this Section 2.11,  such Lender shall remit to such Borrower an
amount equal to the amount of such  recoupment as reasonably  determined by such
Lender.

                  SECTION 2.12. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement,  if any Lender shall after the date hereof,  notify the Agent
that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation  makes  it  unlawful,  or any  central  bank  or  other  governmental
authority having  jurisdiction over any Lender asserts that it is unlawful,  for
any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder
to make  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to fund or maintain
Eurodollar  Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances  hereunder,  (i) each Eurodollar
Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance, as the case may be, will automatically,  upon
such demand,  Convert into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest
at the rate set forth in  Section  2.07(a)(i),  as the case may be, and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances
or to Convert  Revolving  Credit Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  SECTION 2.13. PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS. (a) Each Borrower
shall make each  payment  hereunder  and relating to the Advances not later than
1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S.  dollars to the Agent
at the Agent's  Account in same day funds.  The Agent will  promptly  thereafter
cause to be  distributed  like funds  relating  to the payment of  principal  or
interest or  facility  fees  ratably  (other than  amounts  payable  pursuant to
Section 2.03, 2.05(c),  2.07(c), 2.11, 2.14, 2.18 or 9.04(d)) to the Lenders for
the  account of their  respective  Applicable  Lending  Offices,  and like funds
relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender
for the account of its Applicable  Lending Office,

<PAGE>
                                       28

in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Upon
its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the  information
contained  therein in the Register  pursuant to Section 9.07(c),  from and after
the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance,  the Agent shall
make all  payments  hereunder  and  relating  to the  Advances in respect of the
interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder,  and the parties to
such Assignment and Acceptance  shall make all  appropriate  adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly  between  themselves.
Upon any  Assuming  Lender  becoming  a  Lender  hereunder  as a  result  of the
effectiveness of a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.05(c), and upon the
Agent's  receipt  of  such  Lender's  Assumption  Agreement  and  recording  the
information  contained  therein  in the  Register,  from and after the  relevant
Increase Date,  the Agent shall make all payments  hereunder and relating to the
Advances in respect of the interest assumed thereby to such Assuming Lender.

                  (b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall
be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may
be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal
Funds  Rate and of  facility  fees  shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a
year of 360 days,  in each case for the  actual  number of days  (including  the
first day but  excluding  the last day)  occurring  in the period for which such
interest or facility  fees are payable.  Each  determination  by the Agent of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

                  (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or relating to the Advances
shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee,
as the case may be;  provided,  however,  that,  if such  extension  would cause
payment of interest on or principal  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances or LIBO Rate
Advances to be made in the next following  calendar month, such payment shall be
made on the next preceding Business Day.

                  (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a
Borrower  prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders from such
Borrower  hereunder  that such Borrower will not make such payment in full,  the
Agent may assume that such  Borrower  has made such payment in full to the Agent
on such date and the Agent may, in reliance  upon such  assumption,  cause to be
distributed  to each Lender on such due date an amount  equal to the amount then
due such Lender.  If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such
payment in full to the Agent,  each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount  distributed to such Lender  together with interest  thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is  distributed  to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  SECTION 2.14. TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by each Borrower
hereunder or relating to the Advances shall be made, in accordance  with Section
2.13, free and clear of and without  deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes
imposed on its overall net income,  and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of
net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political  subdivision thereof or
by any  jurisdiction  in which

<PAGE>
                                       29

such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the  case  may be) is  doing  business  that is
unrelated to this  Agreement  and such net income taxes or franchise  taxes that
would not have been imposed if such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) had
not been  conducting  such  unrelated  business and, in the case of each Lender,
taxes imposed on its overall net income,  and  franchise  taxes imposed on it in
lieu of net  income  taxes,  by the  jurisdiction  of such  Lender's  Applicable
Lending  Office or any political  subdivision  thereof (all such excluded  taxes
being  hereinafter  referred to as  "Excluded  Taxes" and all such  non-excluded
taxes, levies,  imposts,  deductions,  charges,  withholdings and liabilities in
respect of payments  hereunder  or relating to the  Advances  being  hereinafter
referred to as "Taxes").  If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any
Taxes  from or in  respect  of any sum  payable  hereunder  or  relating  to the
Advances to any Lender or the Agent,  (i) the sum payable  shall be increased as
may be  necessary  so that  after  making  all  required  deductions  for  Taxes
(including deductions for Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section  2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)  receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such  deductions  been made, (ii)
such Borrower  shall make such  deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the
full amount  deducted to the relevant  taxation  authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar  levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or relating to the
Advances or from the execution,  delivery or registration of,  performing under,
or  otherwise  with  respect to,  this  Agreement  or  relating to the  Advances
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,  without limitation, any
taxes imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable under this Section 2.14)
imposed  on or paid by such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case may be) and any
liability for penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the
date  such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case  may be)  makes  written  demand
therefor; provided that such Lender shall, prior to a Borrower being required to
indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14(c), furnish to such Borrower
a certificate of a senior  financial  officer of such Lender verifying that such
Taxes or Other  Taxes were  actually  incurred  by such Lender and the amount of
such  Taxes or Other  Taxes and  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail the basis
therefor (with a copy of such certificate to the Agent), provided, however, that
such  certificate  shall be  conclusive  and  binding for all  purposes,  absent
manifest error.

                  (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address  referred to in Section
9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt  evidencing payment thereof.
In the case of any payment hereunder or relating to the Advances by or on behalf
of any Borrower  through an account or branch outside the United States or by or
on behalf of any Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if such
Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof,  such Borrower
shall  furnish,  or shall  cause such payor to  furnish,  to the Agent,  at such
address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment
is exempt from Taxes.  For purposes of this  subsection (d) and subsection  (e),
the terms  "United  States" and "United  States  person" shall have the meanings
specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

                  (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this  Agreement  in the case of each  Initial  Lender  and on the date of the
Assignment  and  Acceptance  or the  Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,
pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from
time to time  thereafter  as requested  in writing by any Borrower  (but only so
long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Agent and
each Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8ECI or W-8BEN,
as  appropriate,  or any  successor  or other form  prescribed  by the  Internal
Revenue  Service,  certifying  that such  Lender is exempt from or entitled to a
reduced  rate of United  States  withholding  tax on  payments  pursuant to this
Agreement or relating to the Advances.  If the forms provided by a Lender at the
time such  Lender  first  becomes a party to this  Agreement  indicates a United
States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero,  withholding tax at such
rate  shall be  considered  excluded  from Taxes  unless  and until such  Lender
provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies,  whereupon
withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes
for periods governed by such form;  provided,  however,  that, if at the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance or the Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,
pursuant  to which a Lender  assignee  becomes  a party to this  Agreement,  the
Lender  assignor was  entitled to payments  under  subsection  (a) in respect of
United States  withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then,
to such extent,  the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding  taxes
that may be imposed  in the  future or other  amounts  otherwise  includable  in
Taxes) United States  withholding  tax, if any,  applicable  with respect to the
Lender assignee on such date.

                  (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed
to provide each Borrower with the appropriate  form described in Section 2.14(e)
(other than if such failure is due to a change in law  occurring  subsequent  to
the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form
otherwise is not required  under the first  sentence of  subsection  (e) above),
such Lender shall not be entitled to  indemnification  under Section  2.14(a) or
(c) with  respect  to Taxes  imposed  by the  United  States  by  reason of such
failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because
of its failure to deliver a form required  hereunder,  each  Borrower  agrees to
take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to
recover such Taxes.

                  (g) If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, deduction or credit of
any Taxes or Other Taxes paid or reimbursed by a Borrower pursuant to subjection
(a) or (c) above in respect of payments  under the Credit  Agreement or relating
to the Advances,  a current  monetary  benefit that it would  otherwise not have
obtained,  and that would result in the total  payments  under this Section 2.14
exceeding the amount needed to make such Lender whole,  such Lender shall pay to
such  Borrower,  with  reasonable  promptness  following  the  date on  which it
actually  realizes such benefit,  an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of
such  benefit or the amount of such excess,  in each case net of all  reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in securing such refund, deduction or credit.

                  SECTION 2.15. SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If any Lender shall
obtain any payment (whether voluntary,  involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off,  or  otherwise) on account of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.05(c),  2.07(c),  2.11, 2.14, 2.18
or  9.04(d))  in excess of its  ratable  share of  payments  on

<PAGE>
                                       31

account of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances  obtained by all the  Lenders,  such
Lender shall forthwith  purchase from the other Lenders such  participations  in
the Revolving  Credit Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing  Lender  to share  the  excess  payment  ratably  with  each of them;
provided,  however,  that  if all or any  portion  of  such  excess  payment  is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be  rescinded  and such Lender  shall repay to the  purchasing  Lender the
purchase  price to the extent of such recovery  together with an amount equal to
such Lender's  ratable share  (according to the  proportion of (i) the amount of
such Lender's required  repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing  Lender)  of any  interest  or other  amount  paid or  payable by the
purchasing  Lender in respect of the total amount so  recovered.  Each  Borrower
agrees  that any  Lender so  purchasing  a  participation  from  another  Lender
pursuant  to this  Section  2.15 may, to the fullest  extent  permitted  by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such  participation  as fully as if such Lender  were the direct  creditor of
such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  SECTION 2.16. USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Advances
shall be available  (and each Borrower  agrees that it shall use such  proceeds)
solely (i) for general corporate  purposes of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries
and (ii) for  acquisitions by such Borrower that have been approved by the Board
of Directors of the corporation that is to be acquired by such Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.17. MANDATORY ASSIGNMENT BY A LENDER; MITIGATION. If
any Lender  requests from a Borrower  either  payment of additional  interest on
Eurodollar  Rate Advances  pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  or  reimbursement  for
increased  costs  pursuant to Section 2.11, or payment of or  reimbursement  for
Taxes  pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender  notifies the Agent that it is
unlawful  for such  Lender  or its  Eurodollar  Lending  Office to  perform  its
obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 2.12, (i) such Lender will, upon three
Business  Days'  notice by such  Borrower to such  Lender and the Agent,  to the
extent not  inconsistent  with such Lender's  internal  policies and  applicable
legal and  regulatory  restrictions,  use  reasonable  efforts to make,  fund or
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances through another  Eurodollar Lending Office
of such Lender if (A) as a result thereof the additional  amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  2.11 or 2.14, as  applicable,  in respect of
such Eurodollar  Rate Advances would be materially  reduced or the provisions of
Section  2.12  would  not  apply  to  such  Lender,  as  applicable,  and (B) as
determined by such Lender in good faith but in its sole  discretion,  the making
or maintaining of such  Eurodollar Rate Advances  through such other  Eurodollar
Lending  Office  would  not  otherwise  materially  and  adversely  affect  such
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  or such  Lender  and (ii)  unless  such  Lender  has
therefore taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured (to the extent
not  inconsistent  with internal  policies and  applicable  legal and regulatory
restrictions),  the conditions  creating such  obligation to pay such additional
amounts or the  circumstances  described in Section 2.12, such Lender will, upon
at least five  Business  Days'  notice  from the  Company to such Lender and the
Agent,  assign,  pursuant to and in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section
9.07, to one or more Eligible  Assignees  designated by the Company all, but not
less than all, of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances then owing to such Lender and
all, but not less than all, of such Lender's  rights and  obligations  hereunder
(other  than  rights in respect of such  Lender's  outstanding  Competitive  Bid
Advance),  without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender, for a
purchase price equal to the  outstanding  principal  amount of each such Advance
then owing to such Lender plus

<PAGE>
                                       32

any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any accrued but unpaid facility fees
owing thereto and, in addition,  all additional  costs  reimbursements,  expense
reimbursements  and  indemnities,  if any,  owing in  respect  of such  Lender's
Commitment hereunder at such time shall be paid to such Lender.

                  SECTION 2.18. EXTENSION OF THE TERMINATION DATE. (i) The
Company may, at its option,  by written notice to the Agent in substantially the
form of Exhibit  E-1 hereto,  no earlier  than 45 days and no later than 30 days
prior to the  Termination  Date then in effect,  request that the Lenders extend
such Termination  Date for an additional  period of 364 days. Such request shall
be irrevocable  and binding upon the Company.  The Agent shall  promptly  notify
each Lender of such request.  If a Lender  agrees,  in its  individual  and sole
discretion,  to so extend its  Commitment  (each such Lender being an "Extending
Lender"),  it shall deliver to the Agent a written notice in  substantially  the
form of Exhibit E-2 hereto of its agreement to do so no earlier than 30 days and
no later than 20 days prior to such  Termination Date and the Agent shall notify
the  Company in  writing  of such  Extending  Lender's  agreement  to extend its
Commitment no later than 15 days prior to such Termination Date.

                  (ii)     If any Lender does not consent, or fails to respond
within  the time  period  set forth in clause  (i) of this  Section  2.18,  to a
request by the Company for an extension of the  Termination  Date then in effect
(each such Lender being a "Declining Lender"),  the Company shall have the right
to:

                  (A)      require any Declining Lender to assign in full its
          rights and obligations under this Agreement (I) to an Extending Lender
          designated by the Company that has offered to increase its  Commitment
          in an amount at least equal to the amount of such  Declining  Lender's
          Commitment in its notice  delivered to the Agent under  subsection (a)
          of this Section 2.18 (each such Extending  Lender being an "Increasing
          Extending  Lender")  and (II) to the  extent of any  shortfall  in the
          aggregate  amount  of  extended  Commitments,   to  any  other  Person
          designated  by  the  Company  and   acceptable  to  the  Agent  (which
          acceptance  shall not be unreasonably  withheld) that agrees to accept
          all of such rights and  obligations  (each such other  Person  being a
          "Replacement Lender"),  provided that (w) such assignment is otherwise
          in compliance  with Section 9.07, (x) such Declining  Lender  receives
          payment  in full of the  aggregate  principal  amount of all  Advances
          owing to such Declining  Lender,  together with all accrued and unpaid
          interest thereon to the effective date of such assignment and all fees
          and other accrued and unpaid  amounts owing to such  Declining  Lender
          under any provision of this Agreement (including,  but not limited to,
          any increased  costs or other  additional  amounts owing under Section
          2.11, and any Taxes or Other Taxes owing under Section 2.14) as of the
          effective date of such assignment, (y) with respect to any Replacement
          Lender,  such  Replacement  Lender  shall  have  paid  the  applicable
          processing and recordation fee required under Section 9.07(a) for such
          assignment and (z) such  assignment  shall be effective on or prior to
          such Termination Date; or

                  (B)      subject to the giving of notice to such Declining
          Lender at least five days prior to such Termination Date,  pay, prepay
          or cause to be prepaid,  on and effective as of such Termination Date,
          the aggregate principal amount of all Advances owing to such Declining
          Lender,  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  thereon to the
          date of

<PAGE>
                                       33


          such  payment,  and all  fees and  other  accrued  and  unpaid
          amounts  owing to such  Declining  Lender under any  provision of this
          Agreement (including, but not limited to, any increased costs or other
          additional  amounts owing under  Section 2.11,  and any Taxes or Other
          Taxes  owing  under  Section  2.14) as of the date of such  payment or
          prepayment, and terminate in whole such Declining Lender's Commitment,
          notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05(a).

                  (iii) The Company shall, no later than one day before the
Termination Date then in effect, deliver to the Agent a notice setting forth the
Commitments of the Extending Lenders and the Replacement  Lenders, if any, which
are to become or be, as the case may be, effective as of such Termination  Date.
If Extending  Lenders  and/or  Replacement  Lenders  provide  Commitments  in an
aggregate  amount  at  least  equal  to  51%  of  the  aggregate  amount  of the
Commitments  outstanding  immediately  prior to such Termination Date, the Agent
shall give  prompt  notice  thereof to the  Lenders  and,  effective  as of such
Termination  Date,  (A) the  Termination  Date shall be extended by 364 days for
such Extending Lenders and such Replacement  Lenders,  subject,  however, to the
provisions of subsection  (b) of this Section 2.18,  (B) each  Declining  Lender
shall have no  further  Commitment  hereunder  and (C) the  Commitments  of such
Extending  Lenders and such Replacement  Lenders shall become or be, as the case
may be the  amounts  specified  in the notice  delivered  by the  Company to the
Agent.

                  SECTION 2.19. EVIDENCE OF DEBT. (a) Each Lender shall maintain
in  accordance  with its usual  practice an account or accounts  evidencing  the
indebtedness  of each  Borrower to such  Lender  resulting  from each  Revolving
Credit Advance owing to such Lender from time to time,  including the amounts of
principal  and  interest  payable  and  paid to such  Lender  from  time to time
hereunder in respect of Revolving  Credit  Advances.  Each Borrower  agrees that
upon  reasonable  notice  by any  Lender to such  Borrower  (with a copy of such
notice to the Agent) to the effect that a  Revolving  Credit Note is required or
appropriate  in order for such  Lender to  evidence  (whether  for  purposes  of
pledge,  enforcement or otherwise) the Revolving Credit Advances owing to, or to
be made by, such Lender,  such Borrower  shall  promptly  execute and deliver to
such  Lender a Revolving  Credit  Note  payable to the order of such Lender in a
principal amount up to the Commitment of such Lender.

                  (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section
9.07(d)  shall  include a control  account,  and a  subsidiary  account for each
Lender,  in which accounts  (taken  together) shall be recorded (i) the date and
amount of each Borrowing made  hereunder,  the type of Advances  comprising such
Borrowing and, if appropriate,  the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
terms of each Assumption  Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and  accepted by it,  (iii) the amount of any  principal  or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from such Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and  (iv) the  amount  of any sum  received  by the  Agent  from  each  Borrower
hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register
pursuant to subsection (b) above,  and by each Lender in its account or accounts
pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of
principal  and  interest  due and payable or to become due and payable from each
Borrower to, in the case of the  Register,  each Lender and, in the case of such
account or accounts,  such Lender, under this Agreement,  absent manifest error;
provided,  however,  that the  failure  of the  Agent or such  Lender to make an
entry,  or any  finding

<PAGE>
                                       34

that an entry is  incorrect,  in the Register or such account or accounts  shall
not limit or  otherwise  affect  the  obligations  of any  Borrower  under  this
Agreement.

          result of which the information concerning such Borrower that has been
          provided to the Agent and each Lender by such  Borrower in  connection
          herewith would include an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit
          to  state  any  material  fact  or any  fact  necessary  to  make  the
          statements  contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under
          which they were made, not misleading.

                  SECTION 3.05.  DETERMINATIONS UNDER SECTION 3.01. For purposes
of determining  compliance  with the conditions  specified in Section 3.01, each
Lender  shall be deemed to have  consented  to,  approved  or  accepted or to be
satisfied with each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented
to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Lenders unless an officer
of the Agent  responsible  for the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
shall have received  notice from such Lender prior to the date that the Company,
by notice to the Lenders,  designates as the proposed Effective Date, specifying
its  objection  thereto.  The Agent  shall  promptly  notify the  Lenders of the
occurrence of the Effective Date.

          the  Company's  corporate  powers,  have been duly  authorized  by all
          necessary  corporate  action,  and do not contravene (i) the Company's
          charter  or  by-laws  or (ii) any law or any  contractual  restriction
          binding on or affecting the Company,  except where such  contravention
          would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) No authorization or approval or other action by, and no
          notice to or filing with,  any  governmental  authority or  regulatory
          body or any  other  third  party is  required  for the due  execution,
          delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement or the Notes
          of the Company to be delivered by it, except for those authorizations,

          hereto, all of which have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and
          are in full force and effect and (ii) where the  Company's  failure to
          receive, take or make such authorization,  approval, action, notice or
          filing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) This Agreement has been, and each of the Notes of the
          Company to be delivered by it when delivered hereunder will have been,
          duly  executed and  delivered by the Company.  This  Agreement is, and
          each of the Notes of the Company when delivered hereunder will be, the
          legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against
          the Company in  accordance  with their  respective  terms,  subject to
          applicable  bankruptcy,  reorganization,   insolvency,  moratorium  or
          similar  laws  affecting   creditors'  rights  generally  and  general
          principles of equity.

          Subsidiaries  as at December  31, 2003,  and the related  Consolidated
          statements   of  income  and  cash  flows  of  the   Company  and  its
          Subsidiaries for the fiscal year then ended, accompanied by an opinion
          of KPMG LLP,  independent  public  accountants,  and the  Consolidated
          condensed  balance  sheet of the  Company and its  Subsidiaries  as at
          April 4, 2004, and the related  Consolidated  statements of income and
          condensed cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the three
          months then ended,  duly certified by the chief  financial  officer of

          condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such dates and the
          Consolidated  results  of  the  operations  of  the  Company  and  its
          Subsidiaries  for the

<PAGE>
                                       39

          periods  ended  on  such  dates,  all in  accordance  with  accounting
          principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  consistently
          applied; provided,  however, that said balance sheet and statements of
          income and cash flows for three  months  ended as at April 4, 2004 are
          instead  prepared in accordance with applicable  rules and regulations
          of the  Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Since December 31, 2003,
          there has been no Material Adverse Change.

                  (f) (i) There is no pending or, to the Company's knowledge,
          threatened  action,  suit,  investigation,  litigation or  proceeding,
          including, without limitation, any Environmental Action, affecting the
          Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  before  any  court,  governmental
          agency or  arbitrator  that (A) would be  reasonably  likely to have a
          Material  Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed  Litigation) or (B)
          purports to affect the legality,  validity or  enforceability  of this
          Agreement  or  any  Note  or  the  consummation  of  the  transactions
          contemplated  hereby, and (ii) there has been no adverse change in the
          status, or financial effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken
          as a  whole,  of the  Disclosed  Litigation  from  that  described  on
          Schedule 3.01(b) hereto.

                  (g) No proceeds of any Advance will be applied in any manner
          that will  violate  or cause any  Lender to  violate  Regulation  U or
          Regulation G issued by the Board of  Governors of the Federal  Reserve
          System.

                  (h) The Company is not, and immediately after the application
          by the  Company  of the  proceeds  of each  Advance  will  not be,  an
          "investment  company",  or a company  "controlled"  by an  "investment
          company",  as such terms are defined in the Investment  Company Act of
          1940, as amended.

                  (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance
          with all applicable laws,  rules,  regulations and orders,  including,
          without  limitation,  ERISA and  Environmental  Laws and Environmental
          Permits, except where the failure to so comply would not be reasonably
          likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (j) To the Company's knowledge, (i) all past non-compliance
          with  any  Environmental  Laws  and  Environmental  Permits  has  been
          resolved without ongoing obligations or costs except where the failure
          to so comply would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
          Effect and (ii) no circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely
          to (A) form the basis of an  Environmental  Action against the Company
          or any of its  Subsidiaries  or any of their  properties that would be
          reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect or (B) cause any
          such  property  to  be  subject  to  any  restrictions  on  ownership,
          occupancy,  use or  transferability  under any  Environmental Law that
          would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (k) No ERISA Event that would be reasonably likely to have a
          Material  Adverse  Effect has  occurred or is  reasonably  expected to
          occur with respect to any Plan.

                  (l) Schedule B (Actuarial Information) to the most recent
          annual report (Form 5500 Series) for each Plan whose  "funded  current
          liability  percentage"  is less than 90% and whose  "unfunded  current
          liability"  exceeds  $5,000,000  (as such terms are defined in

<PAGE>
                                       40

          Section 302(d)(8) of ERISA),  copies of which have been filed with the
          Internal Revenue Service and furnished to the Lenders, is complete and
          accurate  and fairly  presents in all  material  respects  the funding
          status of such Plan.

                  (m) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
          outstanding  liability  with respect to, or is reasonably  expected to
          incur any Withdrawal  Liability to, any Multiemployer  Plan that would
          be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (n) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has been
          notified   by  the   sponsor  of  a   Multiemployer   Plan  that  such
          Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within
          the meaning of Title IV of ERISA,  and no such  Multiemployer  Plan is
          reasonably  expected  to be  in  reorganization  or to be  terminated,
          within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, where such  reorganization or
          termination  would be  reasonably  likely to have a  Material  Adverse
          Effect.

                  (o) Except as set forth in the financial statements referred
          to in Section  4.01(e)  and in Section  5.01(h),  the  Company and its
          Subsidiaries  taken as a whole have no material liability with respect
          to "expected post retirement benefit  obligations"  within the meaning
          of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106.

                  SECTION 5.01.     AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.  So long as any
Advance shall remain unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder,
the Company will:

                  (a) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OBLIGATIONS, ETC. Comply, and cause
          each of its Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects, with all
          applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations and orders,  such compliance to
          include,  without limitation,  compliance with ERISA and Environmental
          Laws as provided in Section  5.01(i),  except  where the failure to so
          comply  would  not be  reasonably  likely to have a  Material  Adverse
          Effect.

                  (b) PAYMENT OF TAXES, ETC. Pay and discharge, and cause each
          of its Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, before the same shall become
          delinquent if the failure to so pay and discharge  would be reasonably
          likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,  (i) all taxes,  assessments
          and  governmental  charges  or  levies  imposed  upon it or  upon  its
          property  and (ii) all lawful  claims  that,  if  unpaid,  will by law
          become a Lien upon its property;  provided,  however, that neither the
          Company  nor  any of its  Subsidiaries  shall  be  required  to pay or
          discharge  any such tax,  assessment,  charge  or claim  that is being
          contested  in good  faith  and by proper  proceedings  and as to which
          appropriate reserves are being maintained.

                  (c) MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. Maintain, and cause each of its
          Material  Subsidiaries  to maintain,  insurance with  responsible  and
          reputable insurance companies or associations (or continue to maintain
          self-insurance)  in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
          carried by companies engaged in similar  businesses and owning

<PAGE>
                                       41

          similar  properties  in the same general areas in which the Company or
          such Subsidiary operates.

                  (d) PRESERVATION OF CORPORATE EXISTENCE, ETC.  Preserve and
          maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain,
          its  corporate   existence,   rights   (charter  and   statutory)  and
          franchises;  provided,  however, that the Company and its Subsidiaries
          may consummate  any merger or  consolidation  permitted  under Section
          5.02(b) and  provided  further that neither the Company nor any of its
          Subsidiaries  shall be required to preserve  any right or franchise if
          the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  or such  Subsidiary  shall
          determine that the preservation  thereof is no longer desirable in the
          conduct of the business of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case
          may be, and that the loss thereof  would not be  reasonably  likely to
          have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) AUTHORIZATIONS. Obtain, and cause each Designated
          Subsidiary  with a  principal  place of  business  outside  the United
          States   to   obtain,   at  any  time  and  from   time  to  time  all
          authorizations,  licenses,  consents or approvals  (including exchange
          control approvals) as shall now or hereafter be necessary or desirable
          under applicable law or regulations in connection with such Designated
          Subsidiary's  making and  performance  of this Agreement and, upon the
          request of any Lender, promptly furnish to such Lender copies thereof.

                  (f) KEEPING OF BOOKS. Keep, and cause each of its Material
          Subsidiaries  with a principal  place of business in the United States
          to keep, proper books of record and account, in which full and correct
          entries  in all  material  respects  shall  be made  of all  financial
          transactions  and the assets and business of the Company and each such
          Subsidiary in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
          in effect from time to time.

                  (g) MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES, ETC. Maintain and preserve, and
          cause each of its  Subsidiaries  to maintain and preserve,  all of its
          properties  that  are  used in the  conduct  of its  business  in good
          working order and condition,  ordinary wear and tear excepted,  except
          where the  failure to do so would not be  reasonably  likely to have a
          Material Adverse Effect.

         terminated have been or will be increased over the amounts contributed
         to such Multiemployer Plans for the plan years of such Multiemployer
         Plans immediately preceding the plan year in which such reorganization
         or termination occurs by an amount exceeding $75,000,000 in the
         aggregate;

then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the
consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the Company and each other
Borrower, declare the obligation of each Lender to make Advances to be
terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the
request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the
Company and each other Borrower, declare the Advances, all interest thereon and
all other amounts payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable,
whereupon the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and
be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers;
provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order
for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A)
the obligation of each Lender to make Advances to such Borrower (or, if such
event has occurred in respect of the Company, to make Advances to any Borrower)
shall automatically be terminated and (B) the Advances, all such interest and
all such amounts owing by such Borrower (or, if such event has occurred in
respect of the Company, owing by all of the Borrowers) shall automatically
become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                    GUARANTY

                  SECTION 7.01. GUARANTY.  For valuable  consideration,  receipt
whereof is hereby  acknowledged,  and to induce each Lender to make  Advances to
the  Designated  Subsidiaries  and to  induce  the Agent to act  hereunder,  the
Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each Lender and the
Agent the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise, of all obligations of the Designated Subsidiaries now or hereafter
existing  under this Agreement or the Notes,  whether for  principal,  interest,
fees, indemnities, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "Guaranteed
Obligations"),  and agrees to pay any and all reasonable and documented expenses
(including  reasonable  counsel fees and expenses)  incurred by the Agent or any
Lender in  enforcing  any  rights  under this  Guaranty.  Without  limiting  the
generality of the foregoing, the Company's liability shall extend to all amounts
that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and that would be owed by any
Designated  Subsidiary  to the Agent or any Lender under this  Agreement and the
Notes but for the fact that such Guaranteed Obligations are unenforceable or not
allowable  due to the  existence  of a  bankruptcy,  reorganization  or  similar
proceeding involving such Designated Subsidiary.


                  SECTION  7.02.  GUARANTY ABSOLUTE.  The Company  guarantees
that the  Guaranteed  Obligations  will be paid strictly in accordance  with the
terms of this  Agreement  regardless  of any  law,  regulation  or order  now or
hereafter  in  effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the
rights of the Agent or any Lender with respect  thereto.  The obligations of the
Company under this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
other  obligations  of any  Designated  Subsidiary  under this Agreement and the
Notes,  and a separate

<PAGE>
                                       48

action or actions may be brought and  prosecuted  against the Company to enforce
the obligations of the Company under this Guaranty,  irrespective of whether any
action is brought  against any Borrower or whether any Borrower is joined in any
such action or actions.  The liability of the Company under this Guaranty  shall
be  irrevocable,  absolute and  unconditional  irrespective  of, and the Company
hereby  irrevocably  waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have in any way
relating to, any or all of the following:

                  (a) any lack of validity or  enforceability  of this
          Agreement or the Notes, or any other agreement or instrument relating
          thereto;

                  (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
          in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed  Obligations or any
          other obligations of any Designated Subsidiary under this Agreement or
          the  Notes,  or any other  amendment  or waiver of or any  consent  to
          departure  from  this  Agreement  or  any  Note,  including,   without
          limitation,  any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from
          the extension of additional credit to any Designated Subsidiary or any
          of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

                  (c) any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent
          to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed
          Obligations;

                  (d) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
          structure  or  existence of any  Designated  Subsidiary  or any of its
          Subsidiaries;

                  (e) any failure of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the
          Company or any Designated  Subsidiary any information  relating to the
          financial  condition,  operations,  properties  or  prospects  of  any
          Designated  Subsidiary now or in the future known to the Agent or such
          Lender,  as the case may be (the Company  waiving any duty on the part
          of the Agent or the Lenders to disclose such information); or

                  (f) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
          statute  of  limitations)  or  any  existence  of or  reliance  on any
          representation  by  the  Agent  or any  Lender  that  might  otherwise
          constitute a defense  available to, or a discharge of, any  Designated
          Subsidiary or the Company or any other guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Designated Subsidiary or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

                  SECTION  7.03.  WAIVERS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.  (a) The Company
hereby waives promptness,  diligence,  notice of acceptance and any other notice
with  respect to any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and this  Guaranty and any
requirement  that the Agent or any Lender  exhaust  any right or take any action
against any Designated Subsidiary or any other Person, and all other notices and
demands whatsoever.

<PAGE>
                                       49

                  (b) The Company hereby waives any right to revoke this
Guaranty,  and  acknowledges  that this  Guaranty  is  continuing  in nature and
applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

                  (c) The Company acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect  benefits from the financing  arrangements  contemplated  by
this Agreement and the Notes and that the waivers set forth in this Section 7.03
are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

                  SECTION 7.04. SUBROGATION. The Company will not exercise any
rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against any Designated Subsidiary or
any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence,  payment, performance
or enforcement of the Company's obligations under this Guaranty or any provision
of this  Agreement or the Notes,  including,  without  limitation,  any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any
right to  participate  in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against
such  Designated  Subsidiary or any other insider  guarantor or any  collateral,
whether or not such claim,  remedy or right arises in equity or under  contract,
statute  or common  law,  including,  without  limitation,  the right to take or
receive from such Designated Subsidiary or any other insider guarantor, directly
or  indirectly,  in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim,  remedy or right, unless and until
all of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other  amounts  payable  under this
Guaranty  shall  have been paid in full in cash and the  Commitments  shall have
expired or  terminated.  If any amount shall be paid to the Company in violation
of the preceding  sentence at any time prior to the later of the payment in full
in cash of the Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty and the  Termination  Date,  such amount shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Agent and Lenders and shall  forthwith be paid to the Agent to be
credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable
under this Guaranty,  whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and any Notes,  or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed
Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty  thereafter arising. If
(i) the Company shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all or any part
of the Guaranteed  Obligations,  (ii) all of the Guaranteed  Obligations and all
other  amounts  payable  under this  Guaranty  shall be paid in full in cash and
(iii) the Termination Date shall have occurred,  the Agent and the Lenders will,
at the  Company's  request  and  expense,  execute  and  deliver to the  Company
appropriate documents,  without recourse and without representation or warranty,
necessary to evidence the transfer by  subrogation to the Company of an interest
in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment by the Company.

                  SECTION 7.05. CONTINUING GUARANTY; ASSIGNMENTS UNDER THE
CREDIT AGREEMENT. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in
full  force and  effect  until the later of the  payment  in full in cash of the
Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts  payable under this Agreement and
the  Termination  Date,  (b) be binding upon the  Company,  its  successors  and
assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable by the Agent and the
Lenders  and their  respective  successors,  transferees  and  assigns.  Without
limiting the  generality of the  foregoing  clause (c), any Lender may assign or
otherwise  transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations  under this
Agreement (including,  without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitment,
the Advances  owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person,
and such other Person  shall  thereupon  become  vested with all the benefits in
respect thereof

<PAGE>
                                       50

granted to such Lender  herein or  otherwise,  in each case as and to the extent
provided in Section 9.07 of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 7.06. NO STAY. The Company agrees that, as between (a)
the Company and (b) the Lenders and the Agent, the Guaranteed Obligations of any
Designated  Subsidiary guaranteed by the Company hereunder may be declared to be
forthwith  due and payable as provided in Article VI hereof for purposes of this
Guaranty by  declaration to the Company as guarantor  notwithstanding  any stay,
injunction or other  prohibition  preventing  such  declaration  as against such
Designated  Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration to the Company
as guarantor,  such  Guaranteed  Obligations  (whether or not due and payable by
such  Designated  Subsidiary),  shall  forthwith  become due and  payable by the
Company for purposes of this Guaranty.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    THE AGENT

                  SECTION 8.01. AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION. Each Lender hereby
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers and discretion  under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Agent by the terms hereof,  together with such powers and  discretion as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including, without limitation,  enforcement or collection of the
Advances),  the Agent shall not be required to exercise any  discretion  or take
any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Majority Lenders,  and such  instructions  shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all  holders of  Advances;  provided,  however,  that the Agent shall not be
required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this  Agreement  or  applicable  law. The Agent agrees to give to
each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by any Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.02. AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC. Neither the Agent nor any
of its directors,  officers,  agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or  omitted  to be taken by it or them  under or in  connection  with this
Agreement,  except for its or their own gross negligence or willful  misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing,  the Agent: (a) may treat
the Lender that made any Advance as the holder of the Debt  resulting  therefrom
until the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment  and Acceptance  entered into
by such Lender, as assignor,  and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided
in Section 9.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel  (including  counsel for any
Borrower),  independent  public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance  with the advice of such counsel,  accountants or experts;  (c)
makes no warranty or  representation  to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection  with this  Agreement;  (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the  performance  or  observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of any Borrower
or to inspect the property  (including  the books and records) of any  Borrower;
(e) shall not be  responsible  to any  Lender for the due  execution,  legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or
any other

<PAGE>
                                       51

instrument  or  document  furnished  pursuant  hereto;  and (f)  shall  incur no
liability  under or in  respect of this  Agreement  by acting  upon any  notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

                  SECTION 8.03. CITIBANK AND AFFILIATES. With respect to its
Commitment,  the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it,  Citibank  shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise  the same as though it were not the  Agent;  and the term  "Lender"  or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly  indicated,  include Citibank in its
individual capacity.  Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money  to,  act as  trustee  under  indentures  of,  accept  investment  banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company,
any  of its  Subsidiaries  and  any  Person  who  may do  business  with  or own
securities  of the Company or any such  Subsidiary,  all as if Citibank were not
the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

                  SECTION 8.04. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has,  independently  and  without  reliance  upon the Agent or any other
Lender and based on the  financial  statements  referred to in Section  4.01 and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,  made its own
credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such  documents and  information  as it shall deem
appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.05. INDEMNIFICATION.  The Lenders agree to indemnify
the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by a Borrower), ratably according to the
respective  principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Notes then held by each of
them (or if no  Revolving  Credit  Notes are at the time  outstanding  or if any
Revolving  Credit  Notes  are  held by  Persons  that are not  Lenders,  ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments),  from and against any
and  all  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  or  disbursements  of any  kind or  nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in
any way  relating to or arising  out of this  Agreement  or any action  taken or
omitted by the Agent  under this  Agreement,  provided  that no Lender  shall be
liable  for any  portion  of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without limitation of
the  foregoing,  each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent  promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any  out-of-pocket  expenses  (including  counsel fees)
incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration,   modification,   amendment  or  enforcement   (whether  through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities  under, this Agreement,  to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by a Borrower.

                  SECTION 8.06. SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may resign at any
time by giving  written  notice thereof to the Lenders and each Borrower and may
be removed at any time with or without  cause by the  Majority  Lenders and such
resignation  or removal shall be effective  upon the  appointment of a successor
Agent. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the
right to appoint a successor  Agent,  subject to the Company's  approval


<PAGE>
                                       52

(which shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).  If no successor  Agent shall have
been so  appointed  by the  Majority  Lenders,  and  shall  have  accepted  such
appointment,  within 30 days  after  the  retiring  Agent's  giving of notice of
resignation or the Majority  Lenders'  removal of the retiring  Agent,  then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,  appoint a successor Agent,  which
shall be a  commercial  bank  organized  under the laws of the United  States of
America or of any State thereof and having a combined  capital and surplus of at
least  $250,000,000,  subject  to the  Company's  approval  (which  shall not be
unreasonably  withheld).  Upon  the  acceptance  of  any  appointment  as  Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent,  such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties
of the retiring  Agent,  and the  retiring  Agent shall be  discharged  from its
duties  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement.  After  any  retiring  Agent's
resignation or removal  hereunder as Agent,  the provisions of this Article VIII
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 9.01. AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this  Agreement or the Revolving  Credit Notes,  nor consent to any
departure by any Borrower therefrom,  shall in any event be effective unless the
same  shall be in  writing  and signed by the  Majority  Lenders,  and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided,  however, that no amendment,  waiver
or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any of the
following: (a) increase the Commitment of any Lender (other than as provided for
in  Section  2.05(c) or Section  2.18) or subject  any Lender to any  additional
monetary obligations, (b) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Revolving
Credit Notes or any fees or other amounts  payable  hereunder,  (c) postpone any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Credit
Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than as provided for
under Section 2.18),  (d) release the Company from any of its obligations  under
Article VII or limit the  liability  of the Company  thereunder  or (e) amend or
waive this Section 9.01 or the  definition of "Majority  Lenders";  and provided
further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by the Agent in  addition  to the Lenders  required  above to take such  action,
affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any Note.

                  SECTION 9.02. NOTICES, ETC.(a) All notices and other
communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier,
telegraphic or telex communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed
or  delivered,  if to  the  Company  or to  any  Designated  Subsidiary,  at the
Company's  address at  Corporate  Headquarters,  100  Crystal A Drive,  Hershey,
Pennsylvania 17033-0810, Attention: Treasury Department, Fax No. (717) 534-6724;
if to any Initial Lender, at its Domestic Lending Office specified  opposite its
name on  Schedule I hereto;  if to any other  Lender,  at its  Domestic  Lending
Office  specified in the Assumption  Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance,
as the case may be,  pursuant to which it became a Lender;  and if to the Agent,
at its address at Two Penn's Way, New Castle,  Delaware 19720,  Attention:  Bank
Loan Syndications,  Fax No. (302) 894-6120; or, as to any Borrower or the Agent,
at such other address as shall be  designated by such party in a written  notice
to the other parties and, as to each other party, at such other address as shall
be  designated

<PAGE>
                                       53

by such party in a written  notice to the Company and the Agent;  provided  that
materials as may be agreed  between the Borrowers and the Agent may be delivered
to the  Agent  in  accordance  with  clause  (b)  below.  All such  notices  and
communications  shall,  when  mailed,  telecopied,  telegraphed  or telexed,  be
effective  when deposited in the mails,  telecopied,  delivered to the telegraph
company or confirmed by telex answerback,  respectively, except that notices and
communications  to the Agent  pursuant  to Article  II, III or VIII shall not be
effective  until  received by the Agent.  Delivery by  telecopier of an executed
counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the
Notes or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed and delivered  hereunder  shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.

                  (b) So long as Citibank or any of its Affiliates is the Agent,
such materials as may be agreed between the Borrowers and the Agent may be
delivered to the Agent in an electronic medium in a format acceptable to the
Agent and the Lenders by e-mail at oploanswebadmin@citigroup.com. The Borrowers
agree that the Agent may make such materials (collectively, the
"Communications") available to the Lenders by posting such notices on Intralinks
or a substantially similar electronic system (the "Platform"). The Borrowers
acknowledge that (i) the distribution of material through an electronic medium
is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks
associated with such distribution, (ii) the Platform is provided "as is" and "as
available" and (iii) neither the Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the
accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the Communications or the Platform and
each expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications
or the Platform. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory,
including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from
viruses or other code defects, is made by the Agent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the Platform.

                  (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the
next sentence) (a "Notice") specifying that any Communications have been posted
to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information,
documents or other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement;
provided that if requested by any Lender the Agent shall deliver a copy of the
Communications to such Lender by email or telecopier. Each Lender agrees (i) to
notify the Agent in writing of such Lender's e-mail address to which a Notice
may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic communication)
on or before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from
time to time thereafter to ensure that the Agent has on record an effective
e-mail address for such Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may be sent to such
e-mail address.

                  SECTION 9.03. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES. No failure on the part of
any  Lender  or the Agent to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any right
hereunder  or under any Note shall  operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any
single or  partial  exercise  of any such  right  preclude  any other or further
exercise  thereof  or the  exercise  of any other  right.  The  remedies  herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  SECTION 9.04. COSTS AND EXPENSES. (a) The Company agrees to
pay or cause to be paid on  demand  all  reasonable  and  documented  costs  and
expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration,  modification and

<PAGE>
                                       54

amendment of this  Agreement,  the Notes and the other documents to be delivered
hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  (A) all due diligence,  syndication
(including printing, distribution and bank meetings), transportation,  computer,
duplication,  messenger  costs  and  expenses  and (B) the  reasonable  fees and
expenses  of counsel  for the Agent with  respect  thereto  and with  respect to
advising the Agent as to its rights and  responsibilities  under this Agreement.
The Company  further  agrees to pay or cause to be paid on demand all reasonable
and  documented  costs  and  expenses  of the  Agent  and  the  Lenders,  if any
(including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  counsel  fees and  expenses),  in
connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings
or  otherwise)  of this  Agreement,  the  Notes and the  other  documents  to be
delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel for the Agent and each Lender in connection  with the  enforcement of
rights under this Section 9.04(a).

                  (b) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Agent  and  each  Lender  and  each of  their  Affiliates  and  their  officers,
directors,  employees,  agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified  Party") from
and  against any and all  claims,  damages,  losses,  liabilities  and  expenses
(including,  without  limitation,  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that
may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each
case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with
the  preparation for a defense of, any  investigation,  litigation or proceeding
arising out of, related to or in connection with the Notes, this Agreement,  any
of the  transactions  contemplated  herein or the actual or proposed  use of the
proceeds  of the  Advances  whether  or not such  investigation,  litigation  or
proceeding  is  brought  by any  Borrower  or  the  directors,  shareholders  or
creditors  of any  Borrower or an  Indemnified  Party or any other Person or any
Indemnified  Party  is  otherwise  a  party  thereto  and  whether  or  not  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby are  consummated,  except to the extent  such
claim,  damage, loss, liability or expense results from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice
of the  commencement  of any action or proceeding  involving any claim,  damage,
loss or liability  referred to in paragraph (b) above,  such  Indemnified  Party
will,  if a claim in respect  thereof is to be made against any  Borrower,  give
written  notice to such Borrower of the  commencement  of such action;  provided
that the  failure of any  Indemnified  Party to give  notice as provided in this
Section  9.04(c)  shall not  relieve  such  Borrower  of its  obligations  under
paragraph  (b) above,  except  only to the extent  that such  Borrower  actually
suffers  damage solely as a result of such failure to give notice.  In the event
that any such action or  proceeding  is brought  against an  Indemnified  Party,
unless in such Indemnified  Party's sole judgment (based on advise of counsel) a
conflict of interest between such Indemnified  Party and a Borrower may exist in
respect thereof, such Borrower shall be entitled to participate in and to assume
the defense thereof with counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to such  Indemnified
Party. After notice from such Borrower to such Indemnified Party of its election
to  assume  the  defense  thereof,  such  Borrower  shall  not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified  Party in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable
costs of investigation). No Borrower shall consent to the entry of any dismissal
or judgment, or enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened action or
proceeding  against any Indemnified Party that is or could have been a party and
for whom indemnity  could have been sought under paragraph (b) above without the
consent of such Indemnified Party unless such

<PAGE>
                                       55

judgment,  dismissal or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving of a release from all  liability in respect of such action or  proceeding
to such Indemnified Party;  provided that each Indemnified Party agrees that, if
a Borrower  reconfirms to such Indemnified Party that it is indemnified from all
liability  in  respect  of any such  action  or  proceeding  referred  to in the
preceding sentence, such Indemnified Party will not enter into any settlement of
any such  action or  proceeding  without  the  consent of such  Borrower  (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). In addition to the foregoing,  each
Borrower shall not, in assuming the defense of any Indemnified  Party,  agree to
any  dismissal  or  settlement   without  the  prior  written  consent  of  such
Indemnified  Party  if such  dismissal  or  settlement  (A)  would  require  any
admission or  acknowledgement  of culpability or wrongdoing by such  Indemnified
Party or (B) would  provide  for any  nonmonetary  relief to any  Persons  to be
performed by such Indemnified Party.

                  (d) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance or LIBO Rate Advance is made by any Borrower to or for
the account of a Lender  other than on the last day of the  Interest  Period for
such  Advance,  as a result of (i) a payment or  Conversion  pursuant to Section
2.03(d),  2.10,  2.12 or 2.18,  (ii) a Commitment  Increase  pursuant to Section
2.05(c),  (iii) acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section
6.01 or for any other reason,  or (iv) by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender other
than on the last day of the Interest  Period for such Advance upon an assignment
of rights and obligations under this Agreement  pursuant to Section 9.07(a) as a
result of a demand by the Company pursuant to Section 2.17, such Borrower shall,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the
Agent for the  account of such Lender any amounts  required to  compensate  such
Lender for any additional  losses,  costs or expenses that it may reasonably and
actually  incur as a result of such payment or  Conversion,  including,  without
limitation,  any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits),  cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

                  (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of any Borrower  hereunder,  the  agreements  and  obligations  of such Borrower
contained in Sections  2.11,  2.14 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of
principal,  interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and relating to the
Advances.

                  SECTION 9.05. RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Upon (a) the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request
or the granting of the consent  specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent
to declare the Advances due and payable  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section
6.01, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  to set off and apply  any and all  deposits
(general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final but excluding  trust
accounts)  at any time held and  other  indebtedness  at any time  owing by such
Lender to or for the credit or the account of any  Borrower  against any and all
of the  obligations  of such  Borrower  now or  hereafter  existing  under  this
Agreement and the Note of such Borrower held by such Lender, whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note. Each Lender
agrees  promptly  to notify the  relevant  Borrower  after any such  set-off and
application,  provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and  application.  The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other

<PAGE>
                                       56

rights and remedies  (including,  without  limitation,  other rights of set-off)
that such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.06. BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall become
effective  (other than Sections 2.01 and 2.03, which shall only become effective
upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it
shall have been  executed  by the Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall
have been notified by each Initial  Lender that such Initial Lender has executed
it and  thereafter  shall be  binding  upon and  inure  to the  benefit  of each
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns,
except that no Borrower  shall have the right to assign its rights  hereunder or
any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

                  SECTION 9.07. ASSIGNMENTS, DESIGNATIONS AND PARTICIPATIONS.
(a) Each Lender may at any time,  and if  demanded  by the  Company  pursuant to
Section 2.17, shall assign to one or more Persons all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement  (including,  without limitation,  all or a
portion of its  Commitment,  the Revolving  Credit  Advances owing to it and the
Revolving  Credit Note or Notes held by it);  provided,  however,  that (i) each
such  assignment  shall be of a constant,  and not a varying,  percentage of all
rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (other  than any right to make
Competitive  Bid Advances,  Competitive Bid Advances owing to it and Competitive
Bid  Notes),  (ii)  except  in the  case  of an  assignment  to a  Person  that,
immediately prior to such assignment,  was a Lender or an assignment of all of a
Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of the
Commitment  of the  assigning  Lender  being  assigned  pursuant  to  each  such
assignment  (determined as of the date of the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  with
respect to such  assignment)  shall in no event be less than  $10,000,000  or an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess  thereof,  (iii) each such assignment
shall be to an Eligible Assignee,  (iv) each such assignment made as a result of
a demand by the  Company  pursuant  to  Section  2.17 shall be  arranged  by the
Company after  consultation  with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of
all of the rights and  obligations of the assigning  Lender under this Agreement
or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations  made  concurrently
with another such assignment or other such  assignments  that together cover all
of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement,  (v)
no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand
by the  Company  pursuant  to Section  2.17 (A) so long as a Default  shall have
occurred and be continuing, (B) unless and until such Lender shall have received
one or more payments from either the Company,  any other Borrower or one or more
Eligible  Assignees  in an  aggregate  amount  at least  equal to the  aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with
accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all
other amounts  payable to such Lender under this Agreement  (including,  but not
limited to, any amounts  owing under  Section  2.11 and Section  2.14),  and the
Company shall have satisfied all of its other  obligations  under this Agreement
as of the effective date of the assignment and (C) if any such Eligible Assignee
is not an existing Lender, the Company shall have paid to the Agent a processing
and  recordation fee of $1,000,  (vi) the parties to each such assignment  shall
execute  and  deliver to the Agent,  for its  acceptance  and  recording  in the
Register, an Assignment and Acceptance,  together with any Revolving Credit Note
subject to such assignment and, if such assignment does not occur as a result of
a demand by the  Company  pursuant  to Section  2.17 (in which case the  Company
shall  pay the fee  required  by  clause  (v)(C)  of this  Section  9.07(a)),  a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (vii) in the case of an assignment
to any Affiliate

<PAGE>
                                       57


of such Lender that is engaged in the  business of  commercial  banking,  notice
thereof shall have been given to the Company and the Agent. Upon such execution,
delivery,  acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Acceptance,  (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto  and,  to the extent  that  rights and  obligations  hereunder  have been
assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and
obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor  thereunder shall,
to the extent that rights and  obligations  hereunder  have been  assigned by it
pursuant  to such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  relinquish  its  rights  and be
released  from its  obligations  under this  Agreement  (and,  in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance  covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto).


                  (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the Lender assignor  thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each  other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:  (i) other  than as
provided in such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  such  assigning  Lender makes no
representation  or warranty  and assumes no  responsibility  with respect to any
statements,  warranties or  representations  made in or in connection  with this
Agreement or the execution,  legality,  validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,
sufficiency  or value of this  Agreement  or any other  instrument  or  document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility  with respect to the financial  condition
of any Borrower or the  performance  or observance by any Borrower of any of its
obligations  under this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished
pursuant  hereto;  (iii) such  assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement,  together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section  4.01(e),  the most recent financial  statements  referred to in Section
5.01(h) and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
make its own credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into such  Assignment  and
Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit  decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement;  (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible  Assignee;  (vi) such assignee appoints
and  authorizes  the Agent to take such  action  as agent on its  behalf  and to
exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms  hereof,  together  with such  powers and  discretion  as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto;  and (vii) such  assignee  agrees  that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations  that by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an  assigning  Lender and an  assignee  representing  that it is an  Eligible
Assignee,  together  with any  Revolving  Credit  Note or Notes  subject to such
assignment,  the  Agent  shall,  if such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  has  been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto,  (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance,  (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to each Borrower.

                  (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance  delivered to and accepted
by it and a  register  for the  recordation  of the names and  addresses  of the
Lenders and the  Commitment  of, and principal

<PAGE>
                                       58

amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register").
The entries in the Register  shall be  conclusive  and binding for all purposes,
absent  manifest error,  and each Borrower,  the Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this  Agreement.  The Register  shall be available for inspection by
any  Borrower  or any Lender at any  reasonable  time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

                  (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks
or other  entities  (other than any Borrower or any of its  Affiliates) in or to
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement  (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it
and any Note or Notes held by it);  provided,  however,  that (i) such  Lender's
obligations under this Agreement (including,  without limitation, its Commitment
to any Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely  responsible  to the other  parties  hereto for the  performance  of such
obligations,  (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement,  (iv) each Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders
shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection  with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant
under any such  participation  shall have any right to approve any  amendment or
waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement  or any Note,  or any consent to any
departure by any Borrower  therefrom,  except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Advances or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,  in each case to the extent subject
to such  participation,  or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal
of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,
in each case to the extent  subject to such  participation.  Each Lender  agrees
that,  promptly  upon selling any such  participation  in  accordance  with this
Section  9.07(e),  such  Lender  shall  deliver  written  notice  thereof to the
Company.

                  (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed  assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section
9.07,  disclose  to the  assignee,  or  participant  or  proposed  assignee,  or
participant,  any  information  relating  to the  Company or any other  Borrower
furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower;  provided that, prior
to any such  disclosure,  the assignee,  or participant or proposed  assignee or
participant  shall agree to preserve  the  confidentiality  of any  Confidential
Information relating to such Borrower received by it from such Lender.

                  (g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement,  any Lender may at any time create a security  interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  the
Advances  owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any  Federal
Reserve Bank in  accordance  with  Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

                  SECTION 9.08. DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARIES. (a) DESIGNATION. The
Company  may at any time,  and from time to time,  by delivery to the Agent of a
Designation  Letter duly executed by the Company and the  respective  Subsidiary
and substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto,  designate such Subsidiary as
a "Designated  Subsidiary"  for purposes of this  Agreement and such  Subsidiary
shall thereupon become a "Designated  Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement
and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower

<PAGE>
                                       59

hereunder.  The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each such designation
by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary.

                  (b) TERMINATION. Upon the payment and performance in full of
all of the  indebtedness,  liabilities and obligations  under this Agreement and
relating to the Advances of any  Designated  Subsidiary  then, so long as at the
time no Notice of  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  or  Notice of  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing  in  respect  of  such  Designated  Subsidiary  is  outstanding,  such
Subsidiary's status as a "Designated  Subsidiary" shall terminate upon notice to
such  effect from the Agent to the  Lenders  (which  notice the Agent shall give
promptly upon its receipt of a request  therefor from the Company).  Thereafter,
the Lenders shall be under no further  obligation to make any Advance  hereunder
to such Designated Subsidiary.

                  SECTION 9.09. CONFIDENTIALITY. Neither the Agent nor any
Lender shall disclose any  Confidential  Information to any other Person without
the  consent of the  relevant  Borrower,  other than (a) to the  Agent's or such
Lender's   officers,   directors,   employees,   agents  and  advisors  and,  as
contemplated  by  Section  9.07(f),  to  actual  or  prospective  assignees  and
participants,  and  then  only  on a  need-to-know  and  confidential  basis  in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) pursuant to
subpoena or other legal process or as otherwise  required by law (provided  that
the Person making such disclosure shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide
the Company with notice thereof), and (c) as requested or required by any state,
federal or foreign  authority  or examiner  regulating  banks or banking  having
jurisdiction over any Lender.

                  SECTION 9.10. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the Notes
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York.

                  SECTION 9.11. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed  in any  number of  counterparts  and by  different  parties  hereto in
separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original  and all of which  taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
agreement.  Delivery of an  executed  counterpart  of a  signature  page to this
Agreement by  telecopier  shall be effective as delivery of a manually  executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.12. JURISDICTION, ETC. (a) Each of the parties
hereto  hereby  irrevocably  and   unconditionally   submits  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction  only of any New York State  court or  federal  court of the United
States of America  sitting in New York City,  and any  appellate  court from any
thereof,  in any  action  or  proceeding  arising  out of or  relating  to  this
Agreement or the Notes, or for  recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and
each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally  agrees that
all  claims  in  respect  of any such  action  or  proceeding  may be heard  and
determined only in any such New York State court or, to the extent  permitted by
law, in such federal court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each of the
parties  hereto  agrees that a final  judgment in any such action or  proceeding
shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each Designated Subsidiary that
has its  principal  place of  business  outside of the United  States of America
hereby  agrees that service of process in any such action or  proceeding  may be
made upon the Company at its offices  specified  in Section  9.02 (the  "Process
Agent") and each such  Designated  Subsidiary  hereby  irrevocably  appoints the
Process

<PAGE>
                                       60

Agent its  authorized  agent to accept such service of process,  and agrees that
the failure of the Process  Agent to give any notice of any such  service  shall
not impair or affect the validity of such service or of any judgment rendered in
any action or proceeding based thereon. Each Borrower hereby further irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any action or proceeding in such courts by
the mailing  thereof by any parties  hereto by  registered  or  certified  mail,
postage  prepaid,  to such  Borrower at its  address set forth in Section  9.02.
Nothing in this  Agreement  shall affect any right that any party may  otherwise
have to serve legal process in any other manner  permitted by law. To the extent
that any  Designated  Subsidiary  has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from
jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process  (whether through service or
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,  execution
or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such Designated Subsidiary
hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement.

                  (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the Notes
in any New York State or federal court of the United  States of America  sitting
in New York City. Each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives, to the
fullest  extent  permitted by law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

To each of the Lenders party
  to the Credit Agreement referred
  to below and to Citibank, N.A., as
  Agent for such Lenders


                            Hershey Foods Corporation
                            -------------------------


Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section
3.01(g)(iv) of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of July __, 2004 (the
"Credit Agreement"), among Hershey Foods Corporation (the "Company"), the
Lenders party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Agent") for
said Lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. and Banc America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint
book managers. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein
defined.

                  I am the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary
of the Company, and I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with
the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

                  In that connection, I have examined:

                   (1) the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of
                  the Company;

                   (2) the documents furnished by the Company pursuant to
                  Article III of the Credit Agreement;

                   (3) the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
                  the Company and all amendments thereto (the "Charter"); and

                   (4) The by-laws of the Company and all amendments thereto
                  (the "By-Laws").

                  I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my
satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of
public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and
other documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. In making such examinations, I have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures (other than those on behalf of the Company), the authenticity of
all

<PAGE>
                                       2

documents  submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic original
documents  of  all  documents  submitted  to  me  as  certified,   conformed  or
photographic  copies. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have,
when  relevant  facts were not  independently  established  by me,  relied  upon
certificates  of the Company or its  officers or of public  officials  and as to
questions of fact and law, on opinions or statements by other lawyers  reporting
to  me.  I  have  assumed  the  due  execution  and  delivery,  pursuant  to due
authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders and the Agent.

                  My opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, where applicable, the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States.

                  Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have
deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:

                  1. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

                  2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
         the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company's corporate
         powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
         and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Company (including, without
         limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
         Reserve System) or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding
         on or affecting the Company or, to the best of my knowledge, contained
         in any other similar document, except where such contravention would
         not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Credit
         Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Company have been duly
         executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.

                  3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery
         and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes,
         or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
         except for the authorizations, approvals, actions, notices and filings
         (i) listed on Schedule 4.01(c) to the Credit Agreement, all of which
         have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and are in full force and
         effect and (ii) where the Company's failure to receive, take or make
         such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing would not have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  4. There (i) are no pending or, to the best of my knowledge,
         threatened actions, investigations, litigations or proceedings against
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental
         agency or arbitrator that (a) would be reasonably likely to have a
         Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Litigation) or (b)
         purport to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or
         enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and (ii) there
         has been no adverse change in the status, or financial effect on the

<PAGE>
                                       3

         Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, of the Disclosed
         Litigation from that described on Schedule 3.01(b) thereto.

                  This opinion letter may be relied upon by you only in
connection with the transaction being consummated pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person for any other
purpose.


                                                              Very truly yours,

          I have also reviewed such matters of law and examined the original,
certified,  conformed or photographic  copies of such other documents,  records,
agreements  and  certificates  as I  have  considered  relevant  hereto.  As  to
questions of fact material to such opinions,  we have,  when relevant facts were
not independently  established by us, relied upon certificates of the Designated
Subsidiary or of its officers or of public officials and as to questions of fact
and law, on opinions or  statements  by other  lawyers  reporting  to me. I have
assumed (i) the due execution and delivery,  pursuant to due  authorization,  of
each of the  documents  referred to above by all parties  thereto other than the
Designated Subsidiary,  (ii) the authenticity of all such documents submitted to
us as originals  and (iii) the  conformity  to  originals of all such  documents
submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies.

          My opinions expressed below are limited to ________________and the
State of New York.

          Based upon the foregoing, and upon such investigation as I have deemed
necessary, I am of the following opinion:

<PAGE>
                                       2

                  1. The Designated Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly
         incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
         _________________________, (b) is duly qualified in each other
         jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property or in which the
         conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be licensed and
         (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and
         operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted
         and as proposed to be conducted.

                  2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Designated
         Subsidiary of its Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement and its
         Revolving Credit Notes, and the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated thereby, are within the Designated Subsidiary's corporate
         powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
         and do not contravene (i) any provision of the charter or by-laws or
         other constituent documents of the Designated Subsidiary, (ii) any law,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Designated Subsidiary or (iii) any
         contractual or legal obligation or restriction binding on or affecting
         the Designated Subsidiary, except where such contravention would not be
         reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Designation
         Letter and each Revolving Credit Note of the Designated Subsidiary has
         been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Designated
         Subsidiary.

                  3. The Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary, the
         Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Designated
         Subsidiary are, and each other Note of the Designated Subsidiary when
         executed and delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, legal, valid
         and binding obligations of the Designated Subsidiary enforceable in
         accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability
         thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
         moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally or by the application of general principles
         of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
         proceeding in equity or at law), and except that I express no opinion
         as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Courts of the
         United States of America to adjudicate any controversy relating to the
         Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary
         or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary or (ii) the effect of the law
         of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) wherein any
         Lender or Applicable Lending Office may be located or wherein
         enforcement of the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the
         Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary may be
         sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected
         by such Lender.

                  4. There is no pending, or to the best of my knowledge,
         threatened action, investigation, litigation or proceeding at law or in
         equity against the Designated Subsidiary before any court, governmental
         agency or arbitrator that would be reasonably likely to have a Material
         Adverse Effect or that purports to affect the legality, validity,
         binding effect or enforceability of the Designation Letter of the
         Designated Subsidiary, the Credit Agreement or any Revolving Credit
         Note of the Designated Subsidiary, or the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby.

                                       3

                  5. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery
         and performance by the Designated Subsidiary of its Designation Letter,
         the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary except
         for such authorizations, consents, approvals, actions, notices or
         filings as have heretofore been made, obtained or affected and are in
         full force and effect.

                  This opinion letter may be relied upon by you only in
connection with the transaction being consummated pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person for any other
purpose.



                                                          Very truly yours,
