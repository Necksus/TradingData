          HERSHEY FOODS ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT TO SELL U.S. PASTA BUSINESS

Hershey, Pa. - Hershey Foods Corporation and New World Pasta, LLC, today
announced that they have signed a definitive agreement providing for the
acquisition of Hershey's U.S. pasta business by New World. As a result of the
transaction, Hershey will receive $450 million in cash and will retain a
minority interest in the business. The principals of New World include C. Mickey
Skinner, retired President, Hershey Pasta Group; Miller Milling Company; and
Joseph Littlejohn & Levy Fund III.

The transaction is to include the AMERICAN BEAUTY, IDEAL BY SAN GIORGIO, LIGHT
'N FLUFFY, P&R, MRS. WEISS, RONZONI, SAN GIORGIO AND SKINNER pasta brands, along
with six manufacturing plants. In 1997, combined sales for Hershey's pasta
business were approximately $400 million.

"Hershey Foods has been involved in the pasta business since 1966. Over the
years, this business has provided profitable growth and good cash flow for the
corporation and today enjoys the leadership position in the U.S. branded dry
pasta category. However, after a thorough review of our strategic direction, we
have concluded that we can generate a better return for our shareholders by
focusing our resources on our confectionery and related grocery and foodservice
businesses," said Kenneth L. Wolfe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Hershey Foods.

"I am extremely pleased by the opportunity to work again with the dedicated
employees of the pasta business, and we are very optimistic about the future
prospects of the business," said C. Mickey Skinner, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, New World Pasta.

New World has indicated that it plans to locate the headquarters for the pasta
business in the Central Pennsylvania area. As part of the transaction, Hershey
and New World have agreed that all of the current pasta employees will be
offered employment by New World. The transaction is subject to any necessary
regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of January 1999.

Joseph Littlejohn & Levy is a leading investment firm specializing in corporate
restructurings, often in partnership with well-regarded executives in specific
industries. Its Fund III has been organized with capital of more than $1
billion. In addition to the food industry, JLL has made investments in a wide
range of other industries, including automotive parts, health care, media and
telecommunications, specialty chemicals, basic manufacturing, and home-building
products.
