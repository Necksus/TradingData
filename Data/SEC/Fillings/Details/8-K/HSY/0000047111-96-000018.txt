            HERSHEY TO ACQUIRE LEAF'S NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS
                AND HUHTAMAKI TO ACQUIRE GUBOR AND SPERLARI


HERSHEY, PA -- Hershey Foods Corporation, one of the leading
confectionery companies in North America, and Huhtamaki, the
international foods company based in Finland, have reached
preliminary agreements on brand licensing and acquisitions
involving their North American and European confectionery
interests.

According to the agreement, Hershey will acquire Huhtamaki's Leaf
North America confectionery operations for a purchase price of US
$440 million plus a royalty for the license of Leaf's North
America confectionery brands from Huhtamaki.  Correspondingly,
Huhtamaki will acquire Hershey's European confectionery
interests, the German praline manufacturer Gubor and the Italian
sugar confectionery company Sperlari, for a purchase price of US
$110 million.  The transaction is expected to be completed by
year-end, subject to approval by both companies' boards and by
appropriate regulatory authorities.

Hershey Foods estimates the loss on disposal of its two European
businesses will be approximately US $45 million, or $.29 per
share.

Huhtamaki will retain the ownership of Leaf's North American
trademarks, such as Jolly Rancher, Whoppers, Milk Duds, Good &
Plenty, PayDay and Heath, and will receive an annual royalty on
Hershey's sales of these brands.  Leaf's North American
confectionery sales in 1995 were US $460 million (which is net of
certain promotional expenses), while Gubor and Sperlari had
combined net sales of US $210 million.

"We are excited about this transaction with Huhtamaki," said
Kenneth L. Wolfe, Hershey's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
"It will allow each company to focus on their respective core
markets.  The consolidation of Leaf's North American
confectionery operations into our current business will allow us
to leverage our existing capabilities, to create synergies and to
better serve both customers and consumers."

Huhtamaki's Chief Executive Officer Timo Peltola said that the
transaction was motivated by shareholder interest.  "Leaf's
profitability in North America has been lower than in Europe. 
The same was true for Hershey's European business, compared to
their North American levels.  The arrangement will result in
higher returns for both companies."

Peltola adds:  "With the Leaf brands no doubt thriving and
generating royalty income in Hershey's capable hands, we can
concentrate more resources on building Leaf's growing European
and Asian businesses.  As such, Gubor and Sperlari will
strengthen our European network in an important way."
