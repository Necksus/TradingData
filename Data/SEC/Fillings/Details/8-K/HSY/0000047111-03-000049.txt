                  HERSHEY FOODS CLARIFIES 2003 PENSION EXPENSE


HERSHEY, Pa., February 11, 2003--Hershey Foods Corporation today announced that
it expects 2003 pension expense to be approximately $12 million higher than
2002. In response to a question during a web-cast conference call on January 29,
2003, the Company indicated 2003 pension expense would be similar to or slightly
below 2002 pension expense. The increased 2003 pension expense now being
projected became evident as actuarial results were updated, and is related
primarily to market performance during 2002.


"The higher non-cash pension expense projected for 2003 does not alter the full
year earnings guidance we gave during the January 29, 2003, conference call,"
said Frank
                                     -more-

Cerminara, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Given this change
in pension  expense,  however,  we believe it is  important to  communicate  the
information to the investment community."


During 2002, the Company contributed $280 million to its domestic pension plans,
primarily to offset the impact of 2002 market performance. The Company's pension
plans are well funded.
