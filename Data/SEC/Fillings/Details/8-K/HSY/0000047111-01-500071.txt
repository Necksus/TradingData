FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              CONTACT: John C. Long
- ---------------------                                       ------------
March 12, 2001                                              (717) 534-7631

                               HERSHEY FOODS NAMES
                       RICHARD H. LENNY PRESIDENT AND CEO

         HERSHEY, PA. - Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today named Richard
H. Lenny  president  and chief  executive  officer  of the global  confectionery
company,  said Kenneth L. Wolfe,  Hershey's chairman and chief executive officer
since 1994.  Lenny most  recently has served as head of the Nabisco  Biscuit and
Snack  business at Kraft  Foods.  Wolfe said he would remain  chairman  during a
transitional  period  not to exceed  one year,  at which time Lenny will add the
chairman position to his title.

         The announcement is the culmination of a planned succession process and
a search for a new CEO that began in 2000 as Wolfe,  62,  approached his desired
retirement age.

         Lenny,  49, most  recently was group vice  president of Kraft Foods and
president,  Nabisco  Biscuit and Snacks,  one of the largest  operating units of
Kraft  Foods,  with annual  revenues of  approximately  $6 billion.  The Nabisco
Biscuit and Snack  business  includes  such brands as OREO,  CHIPS AHOY!,  RITZ,
PLANTERS and LIFE SAVERS.  Prior to the  acquisition  of Nabisco late last year,
Lenny had been president of Nabisco  Biscuit  Company.  He earlier had served as
president of Pillsbury North America at The Pillsbury  Company.  Lenny spent the
first 18 years of his career in various brand and sales management  positions at
Kraft Foods.

         Wolfe said, "Our goal in searching for my successor has been to find an
individual  with the right  combination  of food industry  experience and proven
leadership  ability to guide  Hershey  Foods in this new  century.  We were very
fortunate to recruit

Rick Lenny.  He is an  accomplished  executive with a 24-year career in packaged
goods who has a strong track record of building brands and people.  His enormous
record  of  success  will be a  tremendous  asset to  Hershey  Foods.  I am very
confident  that our  shareholders  and  employees can look to a bright future as
Rick assumes the leadership of our corporation."

         Lenny  said,  "It's a  privilege  to lead  this  great  American  icon.
Hershey's  advantaged  position within the very attractive snack market has been
built on unsurpassed product quality, powerful brand equities, and complementary
acquisitions.  In addition,  the company's historic relationship with the Milton
Hershey School provides significant benefit to others."

         Robert H.  Campbell,  chairman  of the Board of  Directors'  CEO Search
Committee,  added,  "The  directors  of this  company are very pleased that Rick
Lenny has agreed to join us. This brings to a successful  conclusion our work to
find a successor  for Ken Wolfe upon his  intended  retirement.  Ken has done an
outstanding  job of leading this  company over the past seven years,  and we are
confident that Rick will do an equally fine job in the years ahead."
         Wolfe  joined  Hershey  Foods in 1967  and was  named  vice  president,
finance and chief financial  officer of the corporation in 1981, and senior vice
president,  finance  and chief  financial  officer  and a member of the board of
directors in 1984. He was elected  president and chief operating officer in 1985
and chairman and chief executive officer in 1994.

         The  search  was  conducted  by Spencer  Stuart,  the global  executive
recruiting firm.
