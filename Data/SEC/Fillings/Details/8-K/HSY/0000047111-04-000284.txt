2004&#151;</B>Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today announced record sales and
earnings from operations for the third quarter ended October 3, 2004. Consolidated net
sales for the third quarter were $1,254,508,000 compared with $1,191,019,000 for the third
quarter of 2003. Net income for the third quarter of 2004 was $166,229,000, or $.66 per
share-diluted, compared with $143,604,000, or $.55 per share-diluted, for the comparable
period of 2003. Earnings per share for 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one
stock split effective June 15, 2004. </FONT></P>


<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>For the third quarter of 2003, these
GAAP results include an after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $.03 per share-diluted,
associated with the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the Company&#146;s
leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. In addition, the 2003 third
quarter results include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization and
realignment initiatives of $9.7 million, or $.02 per share-diluted, and a gain on the
sale of several gum brands of $8.3 million, or $.02 per share-diluted. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net income for the first nine months
of 2004 includes the benefit of a $61.1 million, or $.23 per share-diluted, non-cash
reduction of income tax expense resulting from second quarter adjustments to tax reserves following the
completion of prior years&#146; tax audits. Results
for the first nine months of 2003 included pre-tax charges related to 2003 business
rationalization and realignment initiatives of $13.7 million, or $.03 per share-diluted,
partially offset by the gain of $8.3 million, or $.02 per share-diluted, on the sale of

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Hershey&#146;s third quarter sales
increased by 5.3%, reflecting unit volume growth associated with the introduction of new
products and limited edition items, as well as net price realization. Gross margin
expanded, despite higher commodities costs, primarily as a result of productivity
improvement throughout the supply chain and favorable pricing. Selling, Marketing, and
Administrative costs declined slightly as a percentage of sales due to discipline in all
spending areas and better targeted, more efficient brand and customer support.</FONT></P>



<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;Our performance during the
third quarter was very strong,&#148; said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and
Chief Executive Officer. &#147;Innovative, on-trend new products and well-executed retail
initiatives delivered excellent sales and market share gains. This above-trend sales
growth combined with tight cost control yielded record profitability. Through the first
nine months of 2004, Hershey&#146;s performance has been balanced and consistent with
solid gains in sales, consumer takeaway, and profitability. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;As we look to the fourth
quarter and into early 2005, we&#146;ll continue to leverage our scale brands by providing
meaningful benefits to consumers and ensuring profitable growth opportunities for our
customers. I&#146;m pleased with our progress to date, and the Company is committed to
building upon this strong foundation. For the full year, net sales growth is expected to
be above our 3-4% long-term objective, and diluted EPS growth will exceed our long-term
9-11% range,&#148; Lenny concluded. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B><U>Note</U></B>: In this
sales and earnings release, Hershey has provided income excluding certain items described
above, in addition to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). This non-GAAP financial measure, as shown in the attached
pro forma income statements, is used in evaluating results of operations for internal
purposes. This non-GAAP measure is not intended to replace the presentation of financial
results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items
provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. </FONT></P>
