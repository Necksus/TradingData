                               (Reverse of Note)

                                KRAFT FOODS INC.

      This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other
evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company
of the series hereinafter specified, which series is initially issued in the
aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000,000, all such Securities issued and to
be issued under an Indenture dated as of October 17, 2001 between the Company
and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to
which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is
hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder
of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and
immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and
the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and
delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or
more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal
amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different
rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject
to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to
different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the
Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Securities
designated therein as 5 5/8% Notes due 2011 (the "Notes").

      The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, issue
additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity
and other terms as the Notes, except for the issue price and issue date. Any
additional notes having such similar terms, together with the Notes, will
constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. No additional notes may
be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to the Notes.

      Section 1010 of the Indenture shall be applicable to the Notes, except
that the term "Holder," when used in Section 1010 of the Indenture, shall mean
the beneficial owner of a Note or any person holding on behalf or for the
account of the beneficial owner of a Note.

      The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire
principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the Company
with certain conditions set forth therein.

      If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in
Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur
and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25%
in principal amount of the Notes of this series then Outstanding may declare the
entire principal amount of the Notes of this series due and payable in the
manner and with effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default
specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) occurs with respect to the Company, all of
the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then outstanding shall ipso
facto become and be immediately due and payable in the manner with the effect
provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or
any Holder.

      The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the
<PAGE>
rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the
Company with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series issued under the
Indenture to be affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of
the Securities of that series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders
of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with
certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series. Any such consent
or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

      No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at
the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the
Indenture prescribed.

      As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, this Note is transferable on the Security Register of the Company,
upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency
of the Company to be maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, or at any other office or agency of the Company maintained
for that purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly
executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

      The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture
and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for
a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a like tenor and of a different
authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

      No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

      The Company, the Trustee for the Notes and any agent of the Company or
such Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the
owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all
other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company,
such Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

      Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to
Notes, may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee
money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on all Notes, as provided in the Indenture.
<PAGE>
      This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

      Certain terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture have
the meanings set forth therein.
