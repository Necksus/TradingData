obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those
stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are

obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those
stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are
inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note shall govern. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As provided in the
Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different
redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one
of a series of the Securities designated therein as 1.625% Notes due 2027 (the &#147;Notes&#148;), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of &#128;750,000,000 on March&nbsp;6, 2015. </P>

thereof) of their Notes pursuant to an offer (the &#147;Change of Control Offer&#148;) of payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the
date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of
Control Payment Date&#148;), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of
the Notes by virtue of such conflicts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: accept for payment

obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those
stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are

redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one

thereof) of their Notes pursuant to an offer (the &#147;Change of Control Offer&#148;) of payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the
date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of
Control Payment Date&#148;), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or

following public notice of the occurrence of the Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies);

Trustee (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights,
obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those
stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are

Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different
redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one
of a series of the Securities designated therein as 3.875% Notes due 2045 (the &#147;Notes&#148;), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of &pound;450,000,000 on March&nbsp;6, 2015. </P>

thereof) of their Notes pursuant to an offer (the &#147;Change of Control Offer&#148;) of payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the
date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of
Control Payment Date&#148;), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or

the Notes by virtue of such conflicts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: accept for payment
