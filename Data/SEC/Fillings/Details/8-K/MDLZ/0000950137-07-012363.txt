<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;8, 2007, Kraft Foods Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Kraft&#148;) entered into a Terms Agreement (the
&#147;Terms Agreement&#148;) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman,
Sachs &#038; Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named
therein (the &#147;Underwriters&#148;), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the
Underwriters $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Notes due in 2010 (the &#147;2010
Notes&#148;), $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.000% Notes due in 2013 (the &#147;2013

Notes&#148;), $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.000% Notes due in 2037 (the &#147;2037 Notes&#148;)
and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due in 2010 (the &#147;Floating
Rate Notes&#148; and collectively with the 2010 Notes, the 2013 Notes, the 2017 Notes and the 2037
Notes, the &#147;Notes&#148;). The provisions of an Amended and
Restated Underwriting Agreement dated as of August&nbsp;8, 2007 (the &#147;Underwriting Agreement&#148;) are incorporated by
reference in the Terms Agreement. Copies of the Underwriting
Agreement and the Terms Agreement are
filed as Exhibits&nbsp;1.1 and 1.2 to this report, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) dated as of October&nbsp;17, 2001,
by and between the Company and The Bank of New York (as successor trustee to The Chase Manhattan
Bank), as trustee, as supplemented by an Officer&#146;s Certificate, dated August&nbsp;8, 2007 (the
&#147;Officer&#146;s Certificate&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) a Prospectus
dated May&nbsp;7, 2004 and a Prospectus Supplement (the &#147;Prospectus Supplement&#148;) dated August&nbsp;8, 2007
(Registration No.&nbsp;333-113620) in connection with the public offering of the Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including limitations on the Company&#146;s
ability, with significant exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale/leaseback
transactions. In addition, upon the occurrence of both (i)&nbsp;a change of control of the Company and
(ii)&nbsp;a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody&#146;s Investors
Service, Inc., Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings within a specified period, the
Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes of each series at a price equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount of such series, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date
of repurchase as and to the extent set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. The Company may redeem
all, but not part, of the Notes of each series upon the occurrence of specified tax events as
described in the Prospectus Supplement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Interest on the 2010 Notes, 2013 Notes, 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes is payable semiannually, in
arrears on February&nbsp;11 and August&nbsp;11, commencing February&nbsp;11, 2008, to holders of record on the
preceding January&nbsp;27 or July&nbsp;27, as the case may be. Interest on the 2010 Notes, the 2013 Notes,
the 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly on February&nbsp;11, May&nbsp;11, August&nbsp;11 and
November&nbsp;11 of each year, commencing on November&nbsp;13, 2007. The Floating Rate Notes will bear
interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR (determined as set forth in the Prospectus Supplement) plus
50 basis points and will be reset quarterly on February&nbsp;11, May&nbsp;11, August&nbsp;11 and November&nbsp;11.
Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year and
the actual number of days in each interest payment period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The 2010 Notes will mature on August&nbsp;11, 2010, the 2013 Notes on February&nbsp;11, 2013, the 2017 Notes
on August&nbsp;11, 2017, the 2037 Notes on August&nbsp;11, 2037 and the Floating Rate Notes on August&nbsp;11,
2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Notes will be the Company&#146;s senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of
payment with all of the Company&#146;s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.

liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel and local counsel at any
time for any indemnified party in connection with any one action or separate but
substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the
same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall (i)
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle, compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened
claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or
contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are
actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement,
compromise or consent (A)&nbsp;includes an unconditional release of each indemnified
party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and
(B)&nbsp;does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a
failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party, or (ii)&nbsp;be liable for any
settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying
party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against
any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment in accordance with
the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) If the
indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient
to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a)&nbsp;or
(b)&nbsp;above (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering
of the Offered Securities or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause (i)&nbsp;above is
not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)&nbsp;above but also the relative fault
of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received
by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the
Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one
hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages
or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d)&nbsp;shall be deemed

connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this
subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall
be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at
which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered
to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&#146; obligations in this subsection (d)&nbsp;to
contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not
joint.

liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and

purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate amount of Offered
Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not
exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities, the Lead Underwriter may make
arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other
persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing
Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their
respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to
purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If
any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities with
respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the aggregate amount of the Offered
Securities, and arrangements satisfactory to the Lead Underwriter and the Company for the purchase
of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the
Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or
the Company, except as provided in Section&nbsp;8. As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;Underwriter&#148;
includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. As used in this Section
only, the &#147;aggregate amount&#148; of the Offered Securities shall mean the aggregate principal amount of
any Offered Debt Securities. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability
for its default. The foregoing obligations and agreements set forth in this Section will not apply
if the Terms Agreement specifies that such obligations and agreements will not apply.

investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the
Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling
person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section&nbsp;7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by
the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be
paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 and the respective obligations of the Company and
the Underwriters pursuant to Section&nbsp;6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered
Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the
termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;7 or the occurrence of any event specified
in clause (iii), (iv)&nbsp;or (v)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;5(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred
by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.

purchase and sale of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the Terms Agreement is
an arm&#146;s length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several
Underwriters, on the other, (ii)&nbsp;in connection therewith and with the process leading to such
transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the
Company, (iii)&nbsp;no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the
Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto
(irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other
matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this
Agreement and (iv)&nbsp;the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it
deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of
them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty
to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under
an Indenture dated as of October&nbsp;17, 2001 between the Company and The Bank of New York (as
successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which
Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights,
obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company,
and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided
in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be
issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if
any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject
to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants
and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note
is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as 5.625% Notes due 2010 (the &#147;Notes&#148;).

having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Notes, except
for the issue price, issue date and, in some cases, the first payment
of interest or interest accruing prior to the issue date of
such additional notes. Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with
the Notes, shall constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. No additional notes may
be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to the Notes.

to an offer (the &#147;Change of Control Offer&#148;) of payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes
repurchased, to the date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30&nbsp;days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to
repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30
days and no later than 60&nbsp;days from the date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of Control Payment

issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if
any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject
to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants
and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note

an Indenture dated as of October&nbsp;17, 2001 between the Company and The Bank of New York (as
successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which

in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be
issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if
any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject
to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants

principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes
repurchased, to the date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30&nbsp;days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to
repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30

provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under
an Indenture dated as of October&nbsp;17, 2001 between the Company and The Bank of New York (as
successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which

issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if
any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject
to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants

principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes
repurchased, to the date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30&nbsp;days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders describing the

indebtedness (hereinafter called the &#147;Securities&#148;) of the Company of the series hereinafter
specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to $250,000,000 (except as
provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under
an Indenture dated as of October&nbsp;17, 2001 between the Company and The Bank of New York (as
successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which
Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights,
obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company,
and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided
in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be
issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if
any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject
to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants
and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note
is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the
&#147;Notes&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notes shall bear interest from and including August&nbsp;13, 2007 until the principal hereof is
paid or made available for payment, and shall be payable from and including November&nbsp;13, 2007 or
from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly
provided for, quarterly in arrears, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, on February&nbsp;11,
May&nbsp;11, August&nbsp;11 and November&nbsp;11 of each year (each an &#147;Interest Payment Date&#148;), beginning on
November&nbsp;13, 2007, to the Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business
on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be on the 15th calendar day
preceding each Interest Payment Date. If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise be a day that is
not a Business Day (as defined below), payment of interest shall be postponed until the next day
that is a Business Day, unless such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, in
which case payment of interest shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day (in both
cases, interest shall be payable for the period up to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date).
Interest shall cease to accrue on any Note on August&nbsp;11, 2010, unless, upon presentation of such
Note, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused, in which case, interest shall
continue to accrue until such payment is made.

including, an Interest Payment Date and ending on, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest
Payment Date is herein called an &#147;Interest Period.&#148; &#147;Business Day&#148; means any day, other than a
Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Note shall
bear interest during any particular Interest Period at a rate per annum equal
to LIBOR (as described below), plus a spread of 0.50&nbsp;percent as determined by the Calculation Agent
(such total, the &#147;Rate of Interest&#148;), for such Interest Period. All percentages resulting from any
calculation of the Rate of Interest on the Notes shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and all dollar amounts used in or resulting
from such calculation on the Notes shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being
rounded upward).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rate of
Interest for the Notes for any Interest Period following the initial Interest
Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the date that is two London banking days
prior to the beginning of such Interest Period (each, an &#147;Interest Determination Date&#148;). With
respect to the Interest Period following such Interest Determination Date, LIBOR shall be
determined to be the offered rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for three-month U.S. dollar deposits that appears on Reuters Page
LIBOR01 at approximately 11:00&nbsp;A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. The Rate of
Interest determined on an Interest Determination Date shall become effective on and as of the
immediately following Interest Payment Date and shall be the Rate of Interest which is payable for
the Interest Period beginning on such Interest Payment Date. &#147;London banking day&#148; shall mean any
day on which dealings in U.S. dollar deposits are transacted or, with
respect to any future date, are expected to be transacted in the London interbank market.

successor service)(or such other page as may replace LIBOR01 on Reuters 3000 Xtra or any successor
service).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this
rate does not appear on Reuters Page LIBOR01, LIBOR shall be
determined by the Calculation Agent as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;LIBOR
shall be based on the rates at approximately 11:00&nbsp;A.M., London time, on such
Interest Determination Date, at which three-month U.S. dollar deposits are offered to prime banks
in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market (selected by the
Calculation Agent after consulting with the Company) for the period commencing two London banking
days immediately following such date and in a principal amount equal to an amount not less than
$1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at that time;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;The
Calculation Agent shall request the principal London office of each of the four
banks mentioned above to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are
provided, LIBOR shall equal the arithmetic mean of such quotations;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;If
fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR shall equal the
arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted at approximately 11:00&nbsp;A.M., New York time, on such Interest Determination Date by three
major banks in New York, New York (selected by the Calculation Agent after consulting with the
Company). The rates shall be for U.S. dollar loans to leading banks having a three-month maturity
commencing two London banking days immediately following such date and in a principal amount equal
to an amount not less than $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such

shall be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest to the principal amount of each Note
