                 December 31, 2001 and 2000 and for Each of the

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS






To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
      Kraft Foods Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Kraft
Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

                   NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               ------------------

Note 1.  Background and Basis of Presentation:

   Background:
     Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of
           Virginia. Following Kraft's formation, Philip Morris Companies Inc.
           ("Philip Morris") transferred to Kraft its ownership interest in
           Kraft Foods North America, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through a
           capital contribution. In addition, during 2000, Philip Morris
           transferred management responsibility for its food businesses in
           Latin America to Kraft Foods North America, Inc. and its wholly-owned
           subsidiary, Kraft Foods International, Inc. Kraft, together with its
           subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Company"), is engaged
           in the manufacture and sale of retail packaged foods in the United
           States, Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific.

     On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
           Nabisco Holdings Corp. ("Nabisco") for $55 per share in cash. See
           Note 5, Acquisitions, for a complete discussion of this transaction.

     Prior to June 13, 2001, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip
           Morris. On June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public
           offering ("IPO") of 280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at
           a price of $31.00 per share. The IPO proceeds, net of the
           underwriting discount and expenses, of $8.4 billion were used to
           retire a portion of an $11.0 billion long-term note payable to Philip
           Morris incurred in connection with the acquisition of Nabisco. After
           the IPO, Philip Morris owns approximately 83.9% of the outstanding
           shares of the Company's capital stock through its ownership of 49.5%
           of the Company's Class A common stock and 100% of the Company's Class
           B common stock. The Company's Class A common stock has one vote per
           share while the Company's Class B common stock has ten votes per
           share. Therefore, Philip Morris holds 97.7% of the combined voting
           power of the Company's outstanding common stock.

   Basis of presentation:
     The  consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
           subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
           with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
           America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
           affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
           of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
           statements and the reported amounts of operating revenues and
           expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
           from those estimates. The Company's operating subsidiaries report
           year-end results as of the Saturday closest to December 31 each year.
           This resulted in fifty-three weeks of operating results in the
           Company's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended
           December 31, 2000.

     Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
           current year's presentation.

Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

   Cash and cash equivalents:
     Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid
           investments with original maturities of three months or less.

   Inventories:
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The last-in,
           first-out ("LIFO") method is used to cost substantially all domestic
           inventories. The cost of other inventories is principally determined
           by the average cost method.

                   NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                ----------------


   Impairment of long-lived assets:
      The  Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for
           impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances
           indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully
           recoverable. The Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow
           analyses to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is
           determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based
           on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any,
           are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of
           disposal.

      In   October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
           issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144,
           "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"
           which replaces SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
           Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." SFAS No.
           144 provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and
           measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long-lived
           assets, expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a
           component of an entity and eliminates the current exemption to
           consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be
           temporary. SFAS No. 144 is effective for the Company on January 1,
           2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to
           have a material impact on the Company's 2002 financial statements.

   Depreciation, amortization and goodwill valuation:
      Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and
           depreciated by the straight-line method over the lives of the assets.
           Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3
           to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up
           to 40 years. Goodwill and other intangible assets substantially
           comprise brand names purchased through acquisitions. In consideration
           of the long histories of these brands, goodwill and other intangible
           assets associated with them are amortized on the straight-line method
           over 40 years.

      During 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and
           SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Effective
           January 1, 2002, the Company will no longer be required to amortize
           indefinite life goodwill and intangible assets as a charge to
           earnings. In addition, the Company will be required to conduct an
           annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets for potential
           impairment. The Company estimates that net earnings and diluted
           earnings per share ("EPS") would have been approximately $2,839
           million and $1.76, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
           2001; $2,531 million and $1.74, respectively, for the year ended
           December 31, 2000; and $2,287 million and $1.57, respectively, for
           the year ended December 31, 1999, had the provisions of the new
           standards been applied in those years. The Company does not currently
           anticipate having to record a charge to earnings for the potential
           impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of
           adoption of these new standards.

   Marketing costs:
      The  Company promotes its products with significant marketing activities,
           including advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions.
           Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Consumer incentive and
           trade promotion activities are recorded as expense based on amounts
           estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a
           period, based principally on the Company's historical utilization and
           redemption rates.

   Revenue recognition:
      The  Company recognizes operating revenue upon shipment of goods when
           title and risk of loss pass to customers. The Company classifies
           shipping and handling costs as part of cost of sales.

      The  Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued EITF Issue No. 00-14,
           "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF Issue No. 00-25,
           "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a
           Reseller of the Vendor's Products." As a result, certain items
           previously included in marketing,

           administration and research costs on the consolidated statement of
           earnings will either be recorded as a reduction of operating revenues
           or as an increase in cost of sales. These EITF Issues will be
           effective in the first quarter of 2002. The Company estimates that
           adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and No. 00-25 will result in a
           reduction of operating revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999 of
           approximately $4.6 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion,
           respectively. Marketing, administration and research costs will
           decline in 2001, 2000 and 1999 by approximately $4.7 billion, $3.7
           billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, while cost of sales will
           increase by an insignificant amount. The adoption of these EITF
           Issues will have no impact on net earnings or basic and diluted EPS.

   Hedging instruments:
      Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting
           for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and its related
           amendment, SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
           Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" (collectively referred to
           as "SFAS No. 133"). These standards require that all derivative
           financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets
           at their fair value as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the
           fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or
           accumulated other comprehensive losses, depending on whether a
           derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction
           and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on
           derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive
           losses are included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are
           affected by the hedged item. As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of
           these new standards did not have a material effect on net earnings
           (less than $1 million) or accumulated other comprehensive losses
           (less than $1 million).

   Stock-based compensation:
      The  Company accounts for employee stock compensation plans in accordance
           with the intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123,
           "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which does not result in
           compensation cost.

   Income taxes:
      The  Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
           "Accounting for Income Taxes." The accounts of the Company are
           included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Philip
           Morris. Income taxes are generally computed on a separate company
           basis. To the extent that foreign tax credits, capital losses and
           other credits generated by the Company, which cannot be utilized on a
           separate company basis, are utilized in Philip Morris' consolidated
           federal income tax return, the benefit is recognized in the
           calculation of the Company's provision for income taxes. The
           Company's provisions for income taxes included in the consolidated
           statements of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
           and 1999 were lower than provisions calculated on a separate return
           basis by $185 million, $139 million and $107 million, respectively.
           The Company makes payments to, or is reimbursed by, Philip Morris for
           the tax effects resulting from its inclusion in Philip Morris'
           consolidated federal income tax return.

   Software costs:
      The  Company capitalizes certain computer software and software
           development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
           computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs, which
           are not significant, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
           estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed five
           years.

   Foreign currency translation:
      The  Company translates the results of operations of its foreign
           subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas
           balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end
           of each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a
           component of shareholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses for
           all periods presented were not significant.

                               ------------------

   Environmental costs:
      The  Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection
           of the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with
           environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable
           and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new
           information develops or circumstances change.

      While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact
           of actions regarding environmental remediation and compliance efforts
           that the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of
           management, environmental remediation and compliance costs, before
           taking into account any recoveries from third parties, will not have
           a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
           position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 3.  Related Party Transactions:

      Philip Morris and certain of its affiliates provide the Company with
           various services, including planning, legal, treasury, accounting,
           auditing, insurance, human resources, office of the secretary,
           corporate affairs, information technology and tax services. In 2001,
           the Company entered into a formal agreement with Philip Morris
           providing for a continuation of these services, the cost of which
           increased $91 million as Philip Morris provided information
           technology and financial services, all of which were previously
           performed by the Company at approximately the same cost. Billings for
           these services, which were based on the cost to Philip Morris to
           provide such services, were $339 million, $248 million and $165
           million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
           respectively. These costs were paid to Philip Morris monthly.
           Although the cost of these services cannot be quantified on a
           stand-alone basis, management believes that the billings are
           reasonable based on the level of support provided by Philip Morris
           and its affiliates, and that they reflect all services provided. The
           effects of these transactions are included in operating cash flows in
           the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.

      In   addition, the Company's daily net cash or overdraft position is
           transferred to Philip Morris or a European subsidiary of Philip
           Morris. The Company pays or receives interest based upon the
           applicable commercial paper rate, or the London Interbank Offered
           Rate, on the net amount payable to, or receivable from, Philip Morris
           or its European subsidiary.

      The Company also has long-term notes payable to its parent, Philip Morris,
           and its affiliates as follows:

      The  two notes maturing in 2002, were related to the financing for the
           acquisition of Nabisco and were at market interest rates available to
           Philip Morris for debt with matching maturities.

      During 2001, the Company used the IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting
           discount and expenses, of $8.4 billion to retire a portion of the
           $11.0 billion long-term note payable to Philip Morris. The remainder
           of this note was repaid with the proceeds from commercial paper
           borrowings. The Company repaid the $4.0 billion note primarily with
           the net proceeds from a $4.0 billion public global bond offering. The
           Company

           also refinanced the two long-term Swiss franc notes payable to Philip
           Morris with short-term Swiss franc borrowings from Philip Morris at
           variable interest rates. The short-term Swiss franc borrowings are
           included in due to parent and affiliates on the Company's
           consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001.

     Based on interest rates available to the Company for issuances of debt
           with similar terms and remaining maturities, the aggregate fair value
           of the Company's long-term notes payable to Philip Morris and its
           affiliates at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $5,325 million and
           $21,357 million, respectively. The fair values of the Company's
           current amounts due to parent and affiliates approximate carrying
           amounts.

Note 4.  Divestitures:

      During 2001, the Company sold several small food businesses. The aggregate
           proceeds received in these transactions were $21 million, on which
           the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $8 million.

      During 2000, the Company sold a French confectionery business for proceeds
           of $251 million, on which a pre-tax gain of $139 million was
           recorded. Several small international and domestic food businesses
           were also sold in 2000. The aggregate proceeds received in these
           transactions were $300 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax
           gains of $172 million.

      During 1999, the Company sold several small international and domestic
           food businesses. The aggregate proceeds received in these
           transactions were $175 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax
           gains of $62 million.

      The  operating results of the businesses sold were not material to the
           Company's consolidated operating results in any of the periods
           presented. Pre-tax gains on these divestitures were included in
           marketing, administration and research costs on the Company's
           consolidated statements of earnings.

Note 5.  Acquisitions:

      Nabisco

      On   December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares
           of Nabisco for $55 per share in cash. The purchase of the outstanding
           shares, retirement of employee stock options and other payments
           totaled approximately $15.2 billion. In addition, the acquisition
           included the assumption of approximately $4.0 billion of existing
           Nabisco debt. The Company financed the acquisition through the
           issuance of two long-term notes payable to Philip Morris totaling
           $15.0 billion and short-term intercompany borrowings of $255 million.
           The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. Nabisco's
           balance sheet was consolidated with the Company as of December 31,
           2000, and beginning January 1, 2001, Nabisco's earnings have been
           included in the consolidated operating results of the Company;
           however, Nabisco's earnings from December 11, 2000 to December 31,
           2000 were not included in the consolidated operating results of the
           Company since such amounts were insignificant. The Company's interest
           cost associated with acquiring Nabisco has been included in interest
           and other debt expense, net, on the Company's consolidated statements
           of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

      During 2001, the Company completed the allocation of excess purchase price
           relating to Nabisco. As a result, the Company recorded, among other
           things, the final valuations of property, plant and equipment and
           intangible assets, primarily trade names, amounts relating to the
           closure of Nabisco facilities and related deferred income taxes. The
           final allocation of excess purchase price at December 31, 2001 was as

Goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2001              $22,023

</TABLE>


      Goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2001 include
           approximately $11.7 billion related to trade names. The Company also
           recorded deferred federal income taxes of $3.9 billion related to
           trade names.

      The  closure of a number of Nabisco domestic and international facilities
           resulted in severance and other exit costs of $379 million, which are
           included in the above adjustments for the allocation of purchase
           price. The closures will result in the elimination of approximately
           7,500 employees and will require total cash payments of $373 million,
           of which approximately $74 million has been spent through December
           31, 2001.

      The  integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company will also
           result in the closure of several of the Company's existing
           facilities. The aggregate charges to the Company's consolidated
           statement of earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and
           integrate Nabisco are estimated to be in the range of $200 million to
           $300 million. During 2001, the Company incurred pre-tax integration
           costs of $53 million for site reconfigurations and other
           consolidation programs in the United States. In October 2001, the
           Company announced that it was offering a voluntary retirement program
           to certain salaried employees in the United States. The program is
           expected to eliminate approximately 750 employees and will result in
           an estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $140 million upon final
           employee acceptance in the first quarter of 2002.

      Assuming the acquisition of Nabisco occurred at the beginning of 2000 and
           1999, pro forma operating revenues would have been approximately $34
           billion in each year; pro forma net earnings would have been $1.4
           billion in 2000 and $1.1 billion in 1999; while basic and diluted EPS
           would have been $0.96 in 2000 and $0.77 in 1999. These pro forma
           results, which are unaudited, do not give effect to any synergies
           expected to result from the merger of Nabisco's operations with those
           of the Company, nor do they give effect to the reduction of interest
           expense from the repayment of borrowings with the proceeds from the
           IPO. The pro forma results also do not reflect the effects of SFAS
           No. 141 and 142 on the amortization of goodwill or other intangible
           assets, or the EITF Issues concerning the classification of certain
           expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. The pro forma
           results are not necessarily indicative of what actually

                               ------------------

           would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated and the
           IPO completed, at the beginning of each year, nor are they
           necessarily indicative of future consolidated operating results.

      Other Acquisitions

      During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco
           and Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in Russia and
           Poland. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was
           $194 million.

      During 2000, the Company purchased the outstanding common stock of Balance
           Bar Co., a maker of energy and nutrition snack products. In a
           separate transaction, the Company also acquired Boca Burger, Inc., a
           manufacturer and marketer of soy-based meat alternatives. The total
           cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $365 million.

      During 1999, the Company purchased several small North American and
           international food businesses for $14 million.

      The  effects of these acquisitions were not material to the Company's
           consolidated financial position or results of operations in any of
           the periods presented.

Note 6.  Inventories:

      The  cost of approximately 54% and 56% of inventories in 2001 and 2000,
           respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The stated LIFO
           amounts of inventories were approximately $150 million and $171
           million higher than the current cost of inventories at December 31,
           2001 and 2000, respectively.

Note 7.  Short-Term Borrowings and Borrowing Arrangements:

      At   December 31, 2001, the Company had short-term borrowings of $2,681
           million, consisting principally of commercial paper borrowings with
           an average year-end interest rate of 1.9%. Of this amount, the
           Company reclassified $2.0 billion of the commercial paper borrowings
           to long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to refinance
           these borrowings. At December 31, 2000, the Company had short-term
           borrowings of $146 million with an average year-end interest rate of
           9.2%.

      The  fair values of the Company's short-term borrowings at December 31,
           2001 and 2000, based upon current market interest rates, approximate
           the amounts disclosed above.

      During 2001, the Company entered into agreements for a $2.0 billion 5-year
           revolving credit facility maturing in July 2006 and a $4.0 billion
           364-day revolving credit facility maturing in July 2002. The Company
           intends to use these credit facilities to support commercial paper
           borrowings, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate
           purposes. These facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net
           worth. None of these facilities were drawn at December 31, 2001. In
           addition, the Company maintains credit lines with a number of lending
           institutions amounting to approximately $768 million. The Company
           maintains these credit lines primarily to meet the short-term working
           capital needs of its international businesses.

      Based on market quotes, where available, or interest rates currently
           available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and
           remaining maturities, the aggregate fair value of the Company's
           long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, at
           December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $8,679 million and $3,459 million,
           respectively.

Note 9.  Capital Stock:

      The  Company's articles of incorporation authorize 3.0 billion shares of
           Class A common stock, 2.0 billion shares of Class B common stock and
           500 million shares of preferred stock. At December 31, 2001, there
           were 555 million Class A common shares and 1.18 billion Class B
           common shares issued and outstanding, of which Philip Morris holds
           275 million Class A common shares and all of the Class B common
           shares. There are no preferred shares issued and outstanding. Class A
           common shares are entitled to one vote each while Class B common
           shares are entitled to ten votes each. Therefore, Philip Morris holds
           97.7% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding
           common stock. At December 31, 2001, 75,949,530 shares of common stock
           were reserved for stock options and other stock awards.

Note 10.  Stock Plans:

      The  Company's Board of Directors has adopted the 2001 Kraft Performance
           Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which was established concurrently with
           the IPO. Under the Plan, the Company may grant stock options, stock
           appreciation rights, restricted stock, reload options and other
           awards based on the Company's Class A common stock, as well as
           performance-based annual and long-term incentive awards. Up to 75
           million shares of the Company's Class A common stock may be issued
           under the Plan. The Company's Board of Directors granted options for
           21,029,777 shares of Class A common stock concurrent with the closing
           date

         of the IPO (June 13, 2001) at an exercise price equal to the IPO price
         of $31.00 per share. A portion of the shares granted (18,904,637)
         becomes exercisable on January 31, 2003, and will expire ten years from
         the date of the grant. The remainder of the shares granted (2,125,140)
         may become exercisable on a schedule based on total shareholder return
         for the Company's Class A common stock during the three years following
         the date of the grant, or will become exercisable five years from the
         date of the grant. These options will also expire ten years from the
         date of the grant. Shares available to be granted under the Plan at
         December 31, 2001 were 54,688,173.

     The Company's Board of Directors has also adopted the Kraft Director Plan.
         Under the Kraft Director Plan, awards are granted only to members of
         the Board of Directors who are not full-time employees of the Company
         or Philip Morris or their subsidiaries. Up to 500,000 shares of Class A
         common stock may be awarded under the Kraft Director Plan. During 2001,
         8,945 stock options were granted under the Kraft Director Plan. Shares
         available to be granted under the Kraft Director Plan at December 31,
         2001 were 491,055.

     The Company accounts for the plans in accordance with the intrinsic
         value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
         Stock-Based Compensation," which does not result in compensation cost.

     Prior to the IPO, certain employees of the Company participated in Philip
         Morris' stock compensation plans. Philip Morris does not currently
         intend to issue additional Philip Morris stock compensation to the
         Company's employees. Philip Morris accounts for its plans in accordance
         with the intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123,
         "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which does not result in
         compensation cost.

     The Company's employees held options to purchase the following number of
         shares of Philip Morris' stock: 57,349,595 shares at an average
         exercise price of $34.66 per share at December 31, 2001; 56,977,329
         shares at an average exercise price of $30.46 per share at December 31,
         2000; and 39,911,082 shares at an average exercise price of $34.34 per
         share at December 31, 1999. Of these amounts, the following were
         exercisable at each date: 44,930,609 at an average exercise price of
         $31.95 per share at December 31, 2001; 38,444,963 at an average
         exercise price of $34.82 per share at December 31, 2000; and 31,071,681
         at an average exercise price of $32.75 per share at December 31, 1999.

     Had compensation cost for stock option awards under the Kraft plans and
         Philip Morris' plans been determined by using the fair value at the
         grant date, the Company's net earnings and EPS (basic and diluted)
         would have been $1,785 million and $1.11 for the year ended December
         31, 2001; $1,947 million and $1.34 for the year ended December 31,
         2000; and $1,713 million and $1.18 for the year ended December 31,
         1999. The foregoing impact of compensation cost was determined using a
         modified Black-Scholes methodology and the following assumptions:

</TABLE>

     In addition, certain of the Company's employees held shares of Philip
         Morris restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock, giving
         these employees in most instances all of the rights of shareholders,
         except that they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber
         such shares and rights. Such shares are subject to forfeiture if
         certain employment conditions are not met. During 2001 and 2000, Philip
         Morris granted to certain of the Company's U.S. employees restricted
         stock of 279,120 shares and 2,113,570 shares, respectively. Philip
         Morris also issued to certain of the Company's non-U.S. employees
         rights to receive 31,310 and 683,790 equivalent shares during 2001 and
         2000, respectively. During 1999, there were no restricted stock grants
         issued to the Company's employees. At December 31, 2001, restrictions
         on the stock, net of forfeitures, lapse as follows: 2002 -- 2,638,410
         shares; and 2003 -- 92,000 shares. The fair value of the restricted
         shares and rights at the date of grant is amortized to expense ratably
         over the restriction period through a charge from Philip Morris. In
         2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company recorded compensation expense related
         to restricted stock awards of $39 million, $23 million and $3 million,
         respectively.

         foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $1.5
         billion of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are
         expected to be permanently reinvested. The Company is unable to provide
         a meaningful estimate of additional deferred taxes that would have been
         provided were these earnings not considered permanently reinvested.

     The effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S.
         federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended
         December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

Note 13.  Segment Reporting:

     The Company manufactures and markets packaged retail food products,
         consisting principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals
         and various packaged grocery products through its North American and
         international food businesses. Reportable segments for the North
         American businesses are organized and managed principally by product
         category. The North American food segments are Cheese, Meals and
         Enhancers; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages, Desserts and
         Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Kraft Foods North America's food
         service business within the United States and its businesses in Canada
         and Mexico are managed through the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment.
         International operations are organized and managed by geographic
         location. The international food segments are Europe, Middle East and
         Africa; and Latin America and Asia Pacific.

     The Company's management reviews operating companies income to evaluate
         segment performance and allocate resources. Operating companies income
         excludes general corporate expenses and amortization of goodwill.
         Interest and other debt expense, net and provision for income taxes are
         centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented by
         segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment
         profitability reviewed by management. The Company's assets, which are
         principally in the United States and Europe, are managed
         geographically. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as
         those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

     During 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $53 million for site
         reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the United States.
         In addition, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million to
         close a North American food factory. These pre-tax charges, which
         aggregate $82 million, were included in marketing, administration and
         research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings for the

         following segments: Cheese, Meals and Enhancers, $63 million; Biscuits,
         Snacks and Confectionery, $2 million; Beverages, Desserts and Cereals,
         $12 million; and Oscar Mayer and Pizza, $5 million.

     During 1999, the Company's North American food business announced that it
         was offering voluntary retirement incentive or separation programs to
         certain eligible hourly and salaried employees in the United States.
         Employees electing to terminate employment under the terms of these
         programs were entitled to enhanced retirement or severance benefits.
         Approximately 1,100 hourly and salaried employees accepted the benefits
         offered by these programs and elected to retire or terminate. As a
         result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $157 million during
         1999. This charge was included in marketing, administration and
         research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings for the
         following segments: Cheese, Meals and Enhancers, $71 million; Oscar
         Mayer and Pizza, $38 million; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery, $2
         million; and Beverages, Desserts and Cereals, $46 million. Payments of
         pension and postretirement benefits are made in accordance with the
         terms of the applicable benefit plans. Severance benefits, which were
         paid over a period of time, commenced upon dates of termination which
         ranged from April 1999 to March 2000. The program and related payments
         were completed during 2000. Salary and related benefit costs of
         employees prior to their retirement or termination date were expensed
         as incurred.

     See Notes 4 and 5 regarding divestitures and acquisitions. The acquisition
         of Nabisco primarily affected the reported results of the Biscuits,
         Snacks and Confectionery and the Latin America and Asia Pacific
         segments.

Note 14.  Benefit Plans:

     The Company and its subsidiaries sponsor noncontributory defined benefit
         pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Pension
         coverage for employees of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is
         provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans,
         many of which are governed by local statutory requirements. In
         addition, the Company's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries provide health
         care and other benefits to substantially all retired employees. Health
         care benefits for retirees outside the United States and Canada are
         generally covered through local government plans.

Pension Plans

     Net pension (income) cost consisted of the following for the years ended
         December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

     In  2001 and 2000, retiring employees elected lump-sum payments, resulting
         in settlement gains of $12 million and $34 million, respectively.
         During 2001, the Company announced that it was offering a voluntary
         early retirement program to certain eligible salaried employees in the
         United States. The program is expected to eliminate approximately 750
         employees and will result in a pre-tax charge of approximately $140
         million upon final employee acceptance in the first quarter of 2002.
         During 1999, the Company instituted an early retirement and workforce
         reduction program that resulted in settlement gains, net of additional
         termination benefits of $41 million.

     The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net prepaid
         asset of $1,796 million and $1,741 million at December 31, 2001 and
         2000, respectively. These amounts were recognized in the Company's
         consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2001 and 2000 as prepaid
         pension assets of $2,675 million and $2,623 million, respectively, for
         those plans in which plan assets exceeded their accumulated benefit
         obligations and as other liabilities of $879 million and $882 million
         at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for plans in which the
         accumulated benefit obligations exceeded their plan assets.

     At  December 31, 2001 and 2000, certain of the Company's U.S. plans were
         unfunded, with projected benefit and accumulated benefit obligations of
         $213 million and $164 million, respectively, in 2001 and $156 million
         and $97 million, respectively, in 2000. For certain non-U.S. plans,
         which have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets,
         the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and
         fair value of plan assets were $1,165 million, $1,073 million and $416
         million, respectively, as of December 31, 2001 and $639 million, $596
         million and $49 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2000.

         to which the Company contributes. These plans cover certain salaried,
         non-union and union employees. The Company's contributions and costs
         are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by
         the plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans
         totaled $63 million, $43 million and $41 million in 2001, 2000 and

                               ------------------


     The current portion of the Company's accrued postretirement health care
         costs of $172 million and $138 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
         respectively, are included in other accrued liabilities on the
         consolidated balance sheets.

     The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
         postretirement benefit obligation for U.S. plans was 7.5% in 2000, 6.8%
         in 2001 and 6.2% in 2002, gradually declining to 5.0% by the year 2005
         and remaining at that level thereafter. For Canadian plans, the assumed
         health care cost trend rate was 8.0% in 2000, 9.0% in 2001 and 8.0% in
         2002, gradually declining to 4.0% by the year 2006 and remaining at
         that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed
         health care cost trend rates for each year would increase the
         accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2001
         and postretirement health care cost (service cost and interest cost)
         for the year then ended by approximately 9.2% and 12.9%, respectively.
         A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend
         rates for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement
         benefit obligation as of December 31, 2001 and postretirement health
         care cost (service cost and interest cost) for the year then ended by
         approximately 7.6% and 10.4%, respectively.

     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligations for U.S. plans at
         December 31, 2001 and 2000 were determined using an assumed discount
         rate of 7.0% and 7.75%, respectively. The accumulated postretirement
         benefit obligations for Canadian plans at December 31, 2001 and 2000
         were determined using assumed discount rates of 6.75% and 7.0%,
         respectively.

Postemployment Benefit Plans

     The Company and certain of its affiliates sponsor postemployment benefit
         plans covering substantially all salaried and certain hourly employees.
         The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working lives of
         the covered employees. Net postemployment costs consisted of the
         following for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

         defined in the respective plans. Postemployment costs arising from
         actions that offer employees benefits in excess of those specified in
         the respective plans are charged to expense when incurred.

Note 16. Financial Instruments:

     Derivative financial instruments

     The Company operates internationally, with manufacturing and sales
         facilities in various locations around the world and utilizes certain
         financial instruments to manage its foreign currency and commodity
         exposures, primarily related to forecasted transactions and interest
         rate exposures. Derivative financial instruments are used by the
         Company, principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from
         fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating
         offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party to leveraged
         derivatives. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and
         throughout the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature
         and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as
         well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the
         various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness.
         Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant
         characteristics and expected terms of a forecasted transaction must be
         specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted
         transaction will occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted
         transaction will not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in
         earnings currently. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge
         accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the
         hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and
         throughout the hedged period.

     The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency
         options to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency
         exchange rates from third-party and intercompany forecasted
         transactions. The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed
         include the Euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. At December 31,
         2001 and 2000, the Company had option and forward foreign exchange
         contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $431 million and $237
         million, respectively, for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies.
         The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with
         forward contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other
         comprehensive losses until the underlying hedged transactions are
         reported on the Company's consolidated statement of earnings.

     The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of an
         insignificant portion of its long-term debt. The differential to be
         paid or received is accrued and recognized as interest expense. If an
         interest rate swap agreement is terminated prior to maturity, the
         realized gain or loss is recognized over the remaining life of the
         agreement if the hedged amount remains outstanding, or immediately if
         the underlying hedged exposure does not remain outstanding. If the
         underlying exposure is terminated prior to the maturity of the interest
         rate swap, the unrealized gain or loss on the related interest rate
         swap is recognized in earnings currently. At December 31, 2001, the
         aggregate notional principal amount of those agreements was $102
         million. Aggregate maturities at December 31, 2001 were $29 million in
         2003 and $73 million in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2001,
         there was no ineffectiveness relating to these fair value hedges.

     During the year ended December 31, 2001, ineffectiveness related to cash
         flow hedges was not material. The Company is hedging forecasted
         transactions for periods not exceeding the next eighteen months and
         expects substantially all amounts reported in accumulated other
         comprehensive losses to be reclassified to the consolidated statement
         of earnings within the next twelve months.

     The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of
         certain commodities used as raw materials by the Company's businesses.
         Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward contracts, as cash flow
         hedges, primarily for coffee, cocoa, milk, cheese and wheat. Commodity
         futures and options are also used to hedge the price of certain
         commodities, including milk, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn, sugar, soybean
         and energy. In general, commodity forward contracts qualify for the
         normal purchase exception under SFAS No. 133 and are, therefore, not
         subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2001 and
         2000, the Company had net long commodity positions of $589 million and
         $617 million, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on net commodity
         positions were immaterial at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The effective
         portion of unrealized gains and losses on commodity futures and option
         contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
         losses and is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the
         Company's consolidated statement of earnings when the related inventory
         is sold.

     Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of
         income taxes, during the year ended December 31, 2001, as follows (in
         millions):

</TABLE>

     The Company does not engage in trading or other speculative use of
         financial instruments. Derivative losses reported in accumulated other
         comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity.
         Transfers of these losses from accumulated other comprehensive losses
         to earnings are offset by gains on the underlying hedged items.

     Credit exposure and credit risk

     The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
         counterparties. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance
         and such exposure was not material at December 31, 2001.

     Fair value

     The aggregate fair value, based on market quotes, of the Company's
         third-party debt at December 31, 2001 was $9,360 million as compared
         with its carrying value of $9,355 million. The aggregate fair value of
         the Company's third-party debt at December 31, 2000 was $3,605 million
         as compared with its carrying value of $3,554 million. Based on
         interest rates available to the Company for issuances of debt with
         similar terms and remaining maturities, the aggregate fair value and
         carrying value of the Company's long-term notes payable to Philip
         Morris and its affiliates were $5,325 million and $5,000 million,
         respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $21,357 million and $21,407
         million, respectively, at December 31, 2000.

     See Notes 3, 7 and 8 for additional disclosures of fair value for
         short-term borrowings and long-term debt.

Note 17.  Contingencies:

     The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal
         proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including a
         few cases in which substantial amounts of damages are sought. The
         Company believes that it has valid defenses and is vigorously defending
         the litigation pending against it. While the results of litigation
         cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final
         outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on
         the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the
         shares of the Company's Class A common stock being sold in the IPO,
         some of the underwriters of the IPO provided written copies of a
         "pre-marketing feedback" form to certain potential purchasers of the
         Company's Class A common stock. The feedback form was for internal use
         only and was designed to elicit orally certain information from
         designated accounts as part of designing strategy in connection with
         the IPO. This form may have constituted a prospectus that did not meet
         the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

     If  the distribution of this form by the underwriters did constitute a
         violation of the Securities Act of 1933, persons who received this
         form, directly or indirectly, and who purchased the Company's Class A
         common stock in the IPO may have the right, for a period of one year
         from the date of the violation, to obtain recovery of the consideration
         paid in connection with their purchase of the Company's Class A common
         stock or, if they had already sold the stock, attempt to recover losses
         resulting from their purchase of the Class A common stock. The Company
         cannot determine the amount of Class A common stock that was purchased
         by recipients of the "pre-marketing feedback" form. However, the
         Company does not believe that any attempts to rescind these purchases
         or to recover these losses will have a material adverse effect on its
         consolidated financial position or results of operations.
