Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then

different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein

Event of Default has occurred with respect to the Notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Change of Control </B></P>

for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then

different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein

interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee)
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the

for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then

different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein

describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the

Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee
for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then
the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note shall govern. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one

different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein
as 3.625% Notes due 2023 (the &#147;Notes&#148;), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000 on May&nbsp;7, 2018. </P>

would be fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with the Notes, shall constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. No additional notes may be issued if an

interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee)
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of Control Payment Date&#148;), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">14e-1</FONT> under the

Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee
for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then

different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein

interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee)
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of Control Payment Date&#148;), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">14e-1</FONT> under the

different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein

describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the

for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then

different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein
