Global LLC (and any currently or previously-affiliated companies, parent companies, successors or predecessors, including Mondel&#275;z International, Inc., Kraft Foods Inc., Kraft Foods Group, Inc., and Kraft Foods Global, Inc., hereafter,
collectively, &#147;MG&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">West has been employed by MG as Executive Vice President &#150; Chief Category and Marketing Officer and
based out of MG&#146;s Corporate Headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois. Since West&#146;s employment relationship with MG is ending, MG has offered West benefits as set forth in this Agreement certain of which are benefits greater than what West is
entitled to otherwise receive, and West has decided to accept MG&#146;s offer. Therefore, West and MG both agree and promise as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>1. Employment Termination</B>: West&#146;s last day of active employment at MG will be September&nbsp;30, 2015 (&#147;Last Day
Worked&#148;). MG will pay West for all unused accrued 2015 PTO days, less applicable withholdings, at the next normal payday following the Last Day Worked (or, if earlier, date of Early Termination (as defined below)). </P>

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><I>Employment Status</I>: Beginning April&nbsp;1, 2015, and continuing through the Last Day Worked, MG will employ West in a part-time capacity (&#147;Transition Period&#148;). During the Transition Period, West will
continue her duties at MG working at least twenty percent (20%)&nbsp;of her average full-time schedule during the preceding thirty-six (36)&nbsp;months. During the Transition Period, West will not incur a Separation from Service, within the meaning
of Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;409A. During the Transition Period, West will be eligible for all applicable benefits in the same manner as similarly situated full-time employees. West will also be eligible for a pro-rated 2015 Management
Incentive Program (&#147;MIP&#148;) award based on her full-time service from January&nbsp;1, 2015 through March&nbsp;31, 2015 and on a part-time basis from April&nbsp;1, 2015 through September&nbsp;30, 2015 (or, if earlier, upon the date of Early
Termination (as defined below)). West may provide services to other persons or entities during the Transition Period so long as it does not interfere with her obligations to MG (e.g., she may not take other full-time employment) or violate
West&#146;s obligations as described in Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. West may voluntarily end her employment with MG prior to the Last Day Worked (&#147;Early Termination&#148;) by providing written notice to the Executive Vice President, Human
Resources of MG. In the event of an Early Termination by West, the Salary Continuation Payments (as defined in Paragraph 3(a) below) will be paid to West as provided for in Paragraph 3(a). In the event of West&#146;s death prior to the payment of
all Salary Continuation Payments under this Agreement, any remaining Salary Continuation Payments will be paid as soon as administratively practicable in a lump sum to West&#146;s surviving spouse, and if none, to her estate. </TD></TR></TABLE>

payment of benefits described in this Agreement, including payments and benefits described in Paragraph 3 herein, are conditioned upon her execution of this Agreement and her execution of the release contained herein as Exhibit A following her Last
Day Worked or Early Termination Date, and are, in significant and substantial part, in addition to those benefits to which she is otherwise entitled. West acknowledges and agrees that MG has&#151;apart from this Agreement &#150; paid her for all
wages that were due to be paid to her prior to the date hereof. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>3. Consideration</B>: In exchange for the promises and releases in
this Agreement, and provided West does not revoke the Agreement as permitted in Paragraph 12 below and does not revoke the release in Exhibit A hereto, MG will provide West with the following benefits and payments: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) MG will make installment payments to West for a period of twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months following the Last Day Worked or, if
applicable, the date of an Early Termination (&#147;Salary Continuation Payments&#148;), equaling the total amount of Six Hundred Ninety-Seven Thousand Dollars (&#147;$697,000.00&#148;) less all required local, state and federal tax and applicable
benefit plan related deductions, which represents twelve (12)&nbsp;months of base pay, to be paid bi-weekly starting on the first pay period following the Last Day Worked or, if applicable, the date of an Early Termination. The first installment
payment shall include all amounts that would otherwise have been paid to West during the period beginning on the Last Day Worked or date of Early Termination, if applicable, and ending on the first payment date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) West will be eligible to receive a pro-rated 2015 MIP award described in Paragraph 1(a) above, paid at West&#146;s
incentive target percent. The payment, less applicable deductions, will be made at the same as it is paid to other executives generally, which is expected to be Q1 2016. West will not be eligible to receive any other MIP payments, except that she
will receive the 2014 MIP award when it is paid to other executives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) West will be eligible to receive a pro-rated Long
Term Incentive Plan (&#147;LTIP&#148;) award under the 2013-2015 performance cycle if the 2013-2015 LTIP satisfies minimum thresholds for an award, West will receive shares, less required deductions, under the LTIP based on the number of full months
of participation from the beginning of the performance cycle through the earlier of March&nbsp;31, 2015 or date of Early Termination. The number of shares awarded for the 2013-2015 performance cycle will be based on the actual Company rating as
determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and shares will vest per the normal vesting schedule of the grant in Q1 2016. All other outstanding LTIP grants will be forfeited on April&nbsp;1, 2015 or

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) For stock option purposes, upon an Early Termination, West will immediately forfeit any unvested stock options and she will
have 12 months from the date of Early Termination to exercise any vested stock options. If West does not experience an Early Termination, West becomes retirement eligible for purposes of stock options and will have until the original expiration date
to exercise outstanding vested and unexercised stock options with unvested stock options continuing to vest per the normal vesting schedule. With respect to any restricted stock, two-thirds (2/3rds)&nbsp;of West&#146;s unvested 2013 restricted stock
award will vest on September&nbsp;30, 2015 (or, if earlier, upon the date of Early Termination, unless the date of Early Termination is on or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2014 in which case West will forfeit her 2013 restricted stock award and only
receive two-thirds (2/3rds)&nbsp;of her 2012 restricted stock award). Applicable tax withholding (and any other withholding payroll taxes) will be satisfied by deducting the number of shares equal in value to the amount of the withholding
requirements from West&#146;s stock award; therefore, the number of shares deposited into West&#146;s account on the vesting date will be net of the shares used to satisfy applicable withholding taxes (rounded up to the nearest whole share). The
administrative time it takes to complete these transactions may be up to 8 weeks from the vesting date. West will forfeit all other unvested restricted stock grants on April&nbsp;1, 2015 or date of Early Termination. If West dies prior to the Last
Day Worked, equity awards will be treated at the better of the foregoing and the treatment upon death. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) West will be
entitled to utilize her financial planner at MG&#146;s expense as she normally would between January&nbsp;1, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2015 provided such amount does not exceed $7,500 and she does not experience an Early Termination on or prior to
December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(f) Following the Last Day Worked, West will be eligible to be covered under MG&#146;s medical
coverage for active salaried employees during the period she is receiving Salary Continuation Payments and thereafter become eligible for retiree medical benefits to the extent then provided by MG for retired salaried employees; provided, however,
upon an Early Termination, West&#146;s eligibility for medical coverage will end as of the last day of the month of the Early Termination and the only medical coverage to be offered West will be in accordance with Federal health coverage
continuation requirements (&#147;COBRA coverage&#148;). For avoidance of doubt, West will not then be eligible for MG sponsored retiree medical benefits. </P>

execution of this Agreement. West acknowledges and agrees that the sums and benefits to be provided under the terms of the Agreement are, in significant and substantial part, in addition to those benefits to which she is otherwise entitled. West may
revoke this Agreement within seven (7)&nbsp;days after she signs it by giving written notice to MG. To be effective, this revocation must be received by the close of business on the 7<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> day after
West signs the Agreement. If West revokes this Agreement she understands that she will not receive the benefits that are conditioned upon her execution of the Agreement. This Agreement will not become effective or enforceable unless and until the

Claims</B>: West is aware of her legal rights concerning her employment with MG. In exchange for the promises of MG above, West agrees to irrevocably and unconditionally release (<I>i.e. give up</I>) any and all claims she may now have against MG
and agrees not to sue MG and any currently or previously-affiliated companies, parent companies, successors or predecessors, and their officers, directors, agents and employees, arising out of the employment relationship between West and MG (the

any other claim or action whatsoever. This general release and waiver does not contain a waiver of rights or claims that may arise after the date the Agreement is executed by West and also excludes any claims made under the Illinois Workers&#146;
Compensation Act, the Illinois Workers&#146; Occupational Disease Act, the Employee Credit Privacy Act, the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, the Illinois Unemployment Insurance Act, and/or any claims which cannot be waived by law. Nor shall
this Agreement preclude West from bringing a charge or suit to challenge the validity or enforceability of this Agreement under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. &#167; 620 et seq.) as amended by the Older Worker&#146;s Benefit
Protection Act. This release does not waive any rights to indemnification, advancement of legal fees, rights to directors and officers&#146; liability insurance coverage (if applicable), or rights to vested benefits. </P>

specific performance, injunction, or similar equitable relief. Claims not covered by arbitration are those claims seeking injunctive and other relief due to unfair competition, due to the use or unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or
confidential information, due to wrongful conversion, or due to the breach of the restrictive covenants set forth in Paragraph 6. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>12.
Review and Revocation</B>: West acknowledges that, before signing this Agreement, she was given a period of twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days in which to consider it. West further acknowledges that: (a)&nbsp;she took advantage of this period to consider
this Agreement before signing it; (b)&nbsp;she has carefully read this Agreement, and each of its provisions; (c)&nbsp;if she initially did not think any representation she is making in this Agreement was true, or if she initially was uncomfortable
making it, she resolved all of her doubts and concerns before signing this Agreement; (d)&nbsp;West fully understands what the Agreement, and each of its provisions, means; and (e)&nbsp;she is entering into the Agreement, and each of its provisions,
knowingly and voluntarily. MG encourages West to discuss this Agreement, and each of its provisions, with an attorney before signing it. West acknowledges that she sought such advice to the extent she deemed appropriate. If West signs this Agreement
before the end of the twenty-one (21)&nbsp;day period, it will be her voluntary decision to do so because she has decided that she does not need any additional time to decide whether to sign this Agreement. West also understands that she does not
have more than twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days to sign this Agreement. If West does not sign this Agreement by the end of the twenty-one (21)&nbsp;day period, she understands that it will become null and void. West also acknowledges and understands that
MG would not have given her the special payments or benefits she is getting in exchange for this Agreement but for her promises and representations she made by signing it. Further, by signing below, West acknowledges that she may revoke this
Agreement at any time within seven (7)&nbsp;days of the date on which she signed it as described above in Paragraph 3(e). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>13. Entire
Agreement and Severability</B>: This is the entire agreement between West and MG on the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified or canceled in any manner except by a writing signed by both West and an authorized Company
official. West acknowledges that MG has made no representations or promises to her, other than those in this Agreement. If any provision in this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, all other provisions will remain fully enforceable. The
covenants set forth in this Agreement shall be considered and construed as separate and independent covenants. Should any part or provision of any provision of this Agreement be held invalid, void or unenforceable in any court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void or unenforceable any other part or provision of this Agreement. If the release and waiver of claims provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable,
the parties agree to enter into a release and waiver agreement that is enforceable. </P>

Worker&#146;s Benefit Protection Act. This release does not waive any rights to indemnification, advancement of legal fees, rights to directors and officers liability insurance coverage, rights to equity, or rights to vested benefits. </P>
