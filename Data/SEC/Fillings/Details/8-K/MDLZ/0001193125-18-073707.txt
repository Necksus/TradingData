as modified pursuant to Section 301 thereof in respect of the Notes by that certain Officers&#146; Certificate of the Company dated as of the date hereof (collectively, as modified, the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which Indenture and all other
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of
Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference
to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then the terms, conditions
and other provisions of this Note shall govern. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which
different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking,
purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as 3.250% Notes due
2025 (the &#147;Notes&#148;), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of C$600,000,000 on March 7, 2018. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company may,
without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Notes, except for the issue price, issue date and, in some cases, the first payment of
interest or interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional notes. The additional notes may only be issued if they would be fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any additional notes having such similar terms,
together with the Notes, shall constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. No additional notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to the Notes. </P>

their Notes pursuant to an offer (the &#147;Change of Control Offer&#148;) of payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of
purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of Control
Payment Date&#148;), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and any other securities laws
and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of
the Notes by virtue of such conflicts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: accept for payment

&#147;Securities&#148;) of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of March&nbsp;6, 2015, by and between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
Trustee, as modified pursuant to Section&nbsp;301 thereof in respect of the Notes by that certain Officers&#146; Certificate of the Company dated as of the date hereof (collectively, as modified, the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which Indenture and
all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each
series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of this Note are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by
reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. To the extent the terms, conditions and other provisions of this Note modify, supplement or are inconsistent with those of the Indenture, then the terms,
conditions and other provisions of this Note shall govern. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more
series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different
sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as 3.250%
Notes due 2025 (the &#147;Notes&#148;), initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of C$600,000,000 on March&nbsp;7, 2018. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Notes, except for the issue price, issue date and, in some cases, the first
payment of interest or interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional notes. The additional notes may only be issued if they would be fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any additional notes having such
similar terms, together with the Notes, shall constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. No additional notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to the Notes. </P>

their Notes pursuant to an offer (the &#147;Change of Control Offer&#148;) of payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of
purchase (the &#147;Change of Control Payment&#148;). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to Holders (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the &#147;Change of Control
Payment Date&#148;), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The Company must comply with the requirements of Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">14e-1</FONT> under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange
Act&#148;) and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Change of Control provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflicts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to
