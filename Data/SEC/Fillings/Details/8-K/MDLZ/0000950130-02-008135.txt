                               (Reverse of Note)

                                KRAFT FOODS INC.

                  This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures,
notes or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities")
of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is initially
issued in the aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000, all such Securities
issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of October 17, 2001 between
the Company and The Chase Manhattan Bank (now known as JPMorgan Chase Bank), as
Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the
rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and
of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series
of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are
and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the
Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be
issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times,
may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different
redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or
analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of
Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This
Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as Floating Rate
Notes due 2004 (the "Notes").

                  The Notes shall bear interest from and including November 26,
2002 until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and shall
be payable from and including November 26, 2002 or from and including the most
recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for, quarterly in arrears, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, on
February 26, May 26, August 26 and November 26 of each year (each an "Interest
Payment Date"), beginning on February 26, 2003, to the Holders in whose names
the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for
such interest installment, which shall be on the 15th calendar day preceding
each Interest Payment Date. If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise be a
day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), payment of interest shall be
postponed until the next day that is a Business Day, unless such Business Day
falls in the next succeeding calendar month, in which case payment of interest
shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day (in both cases, interest
shall be payable for the period up to, but excluding, such Interest Payment
Date). Interest shall cease to accrue on any Note on November 26, 2004, unless,
upon presentation of such Note, payment of principal is improperly withheld or
refused, in which case, interest shall continue to accrue until such payment is
made.

                  The period beginning on, and including, November 26, 2002, and
ending on, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date thereafter, and each
successive quarterly period beginning on, and including, an Interest Payment
Date and ending on, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date is
herein called an "Interest Period." "Business Day" means any day, other than a
Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which
commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive
order to close in New York.

                  Each Note shall bear interest during any particular Interest
Period at a rate equal to LIBOR (as described below), plus a spread of 0.20 per
cent (such total, the "Rate of Interest"), for such Interest Period. All
percentages resulting from any calculation of the Rate of Interest on the Notes
shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage

point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g.,
9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and
9.876544% (or .09876544) would be rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654)), and all
dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Notes shall be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).

         The Rate of Interest for the Notes for any Interest Period following
the initial Interest Period shall be determined on the date that is two London
banking days prior to the beginning of such Interest Period (each, an "Interest
Determination Date"). With respect to the Interest Period following such
Interest Determination Date, LIBOR shall be determined to be the offered rate
for three-month U.S. dollar deposits that appears on Telerate Page 3750 at
approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. The
Rate of Interest determined on an Interest Determination Date shall become
effective on and as of the immediately following Interest Payment Date and shall
be the Rate of Interest which is payable for the Interest Period beginning on
such Interest Payment Date. "London banking day" shall mean any day on which
dealings in U.S. dollar deposits are transacted in the London interbank market.
"Telerate Page 3750" means the display page so designated on the Telerate
Service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major
banks (or any successor page).

         If this rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, LIBOR shall be
determined as follows:

         (i)   LIBOR shall be based on the rates at approximately 11:00 A.M.,
               London time, on such Interest Determination Date, at which
               three-month U.S. dollar deposits are offered to prime banks in
               the London interbank market by four major banks in the London
               interbank market (selected by the Calculation Agent after
               consulting with the Company) for the period commencing two London
               banking days immediately following such date and in a principal
               amount equal to an amount not less than $1,000,000 that is
               representative for a single transaction in such market at that
               time;

         (ii)  The Calculation Agent shall request the principal London office
               of each of the four banks mentioned above to provide a quotation
               of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR
               shall equal the average of such quotations;

         (iii) If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR shall equal the
               average of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York
               time, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in
               New York, New York (selected by the Calculation Agent after
               consulting with the Company). The rates shall be for U.S. dollar
               loans to leading banks having a three-month maturity commencing
               two London banking days immediately following such date and in a
               principal amount equal to an amount not less than $1,000,000 that
               is representative for a single transaction in such market at that
               time; and

         (iv)  If fewer than three quotations are provided pursuant to paragraph
               (iii), the Rate of Interest in effect for the applicable period
               shall be the same as the

                                        2

<PAGE>

               Rate of Interest determined on the immediately preceding Interest
               Determination Date.

         So long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the Company shall
maintain under appointment a calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent") to
calculate the Rate of Interest payable on the Notes in respect of each Interest
Period, other than the initial Interest Period. If the Calculation Agent fails
to establish the Rate of Interest for any Interest Period, or if the Company
removes the Calculation Agent, the Company shall appoint another commercial or
investment bank to act as the Calculation Agent. The Company may appoint a
successor Calculation Agent at any time at the Company's discretion and without
notice.

         The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 A.M.,
London time, on each Interest Determination Date, determine the Rate of Interest
and calculate the amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the "Interest Amount"). The Interest Amount shall be calculated
by applying the Rate of Interest to the principal amount of each Note
outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such
amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by
360. The determination of the Rate of Interest and the Interest Amount by the
Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith or
manifest error) be final and binding on all parties. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Rate of Interest on the Notes shall in no event be
higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be
modified by United States law of general application. The Rate of Interest for
the initial Interest Period shall be 1.62625%.

         The Calculation Agent shall, upon the request of the Holder of any
note, provide the Rate of Interest then in effect. All certificates,
communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions
given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions relating
to the payment and calculation of the Rate of Interest on the Notes by the
Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith or
manifest error) be final and binding on the Company, the Calculation Agent and
all of the Holders and owners of beneficial interests in the Notes, and no
liability shall (in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence)
attach to the Calculation Agent in connection with the exercise by it of its
powers, duties and discretions.

         The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, issue
additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity
and other terms as the Notes, except for the issue price and issue date. Any
additional notes having such similar terms, together with the Notes, shall
constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. No additional notes may
be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to the Notes.

         The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the
entire principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the
Company with certain conditions set forth therein.

         If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in
Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur
and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25%
in principal amount of the Notes of this series

                                        3

<PAGE>

then Outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the Notes of this
series due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) occurs with respect
to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then
outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable in the
manner with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or
other act by the Trustee or any Holder.

         The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at
any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in
aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each
series issued under the Indenture to be affected thereby. The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time Outstanding, on
behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance
by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series.
Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any
Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange or in lieu
hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at
the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the
Indenture prescribed.

         As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Note shall be registered on the Security
Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office or agency of the Company to be maintained for that
purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at any other
office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, duly endorsed by,
or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of
authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be
issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

         The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture
and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for
a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a like tenor and of a different
authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

                                       4

owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all
other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company,
such Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

         Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect
to Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee
money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on all Notes, as provided in the Indenture.

         The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to a
