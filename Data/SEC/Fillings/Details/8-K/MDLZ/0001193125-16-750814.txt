Arrangement of a Registrant. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;28, 2016, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (&#147;MIHNBV&#148;), a wholly-owned Dutch
subsidiary of Mondel&#275;z International, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2019 (the &#147;2019 Floating Rate Notes&#148;), $1,750 million aggregate principal amount of
its 1.625% Fixed Rate Notes due 2019 (the &#147;2019 Fixed Rate Notes&#148;) and $1,500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.000% Fixed Rate Notes due 2021 (the &#147;2021 Fixed Rate Notes,&#148; and collectively with the 2019 Floating Rate
Notes and the 2019 Fixed Rate Notes, the &#147;Notes&#148;) in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated
as of October&nbsp;28, 2016 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), by and between MIHNBV, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, as supplemented and modified in respect of the Notes by an officers&#146;
certificate of MIHNBV under Section&nbsp;3.1 of the Indenture, dated as of October&nbsp;28, 2016 (the &#147;3.1 Certificate&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will be
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, on a senior unsecured basis. The Notes are not registered under the Securities Act, do not bear registration rights and are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MIHNBV will pay interest on the 2019 Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on January&nbsp;28,&nbsp;April&nbsp;28,&nbsp;July&nbsp;28 and October&nbsp;28 of
each year until maturity, beginning on January&nbsp;28, 2017. The 2019 Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.61%&nbsp;per annum. The 2019 Floating Rate Notes will mature on October 28, 2019.
MIHNBV will pay interest on the 2019 Fixed Rate Notes and the 2021 Fixed Rate Notes semi-annually in arrears on April&nbsp;28 and October&nbsp;28 of each year, beginning on April&nbsp;28, 2017. The 2019 Fixed Rate Notes will mature on
October&nbsp;28, 2019. The 2021 Fixed Rate Notes will mature on October&nbsp;28, 2021. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Indenture contains customary agreements and covenants
consistent with those contained in the Company&#146;s outstanding senior unsecured notes. These covenants limit the Company&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146; ability, subject to certain exceptions, (i) to incur debt secured by liens above a certain
threshold or (ii) to engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions above a certain threshold. These covenants also limit the Company&#146;s and MIHNBV&#146;s ability, subject to certain exceptions, to consolidate, merge, convey or transfer its
assets substantially as an entirety. If there occurs a change of control event with respect to the Company combined with a rating downgrade of any series of Notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc. and
Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services within a specified period, MIHNBV will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of repurchase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MIHNBV may redeem the 2019 Fixed Rate Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of their principal amount plus a &#147;make-whole&#148; premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. Prior to September&nbsp;28, 2021, MIHNBV may redeem the 2021 Fixed Rate Notes in whole or in part, at
its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a &#147;make-whole&#148; premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. On or after September&nbsp;28, 2021, MIHNBV may redeem
the 2021 Fixed Rate Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. </P>
