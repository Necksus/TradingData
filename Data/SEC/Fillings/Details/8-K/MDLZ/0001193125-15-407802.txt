Brearton&#146;s employment relationship with MG is ending, MG has offered Brearton benefits as set forth in this Agreement certain of which are benefits greater than what Brearton is entitled to otherwise receive, and Brearton has decided to accept
MG&#146;s offer. Therefore, Brearton and MG both agree and promise as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B></B>1. <B><U>Employment Termination</U></B>:
Brearton&#146;s last day of employment with MG is December&nbsp;31, 2015 (&#147;Last Day Worked&#148;). Brearton will be paid for any accrued, unused 2015 PTO days, less applicable deductions, at the next normal payday following his Last Day Worked.
After the Last Day Worked, Brearton will not represent herself as being an employee, officer attorney or agent representative of MG for any purpose unless the Company authorizes him to do so at its sole discretion.<B> </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B></B>2. <B><U>Sufficiency of Consideration</U></B>: Brearton understands, acknowledges and agrees that the payment of benefits described in
this Agreement, including payments and benefits described in Paragraph 3 herein, are conditioned upon his execution of this Agreement, and are, in significant and substantial part, in addition to those benefits to which he is otherwise entitled.
Brearton acknowledges and agrees that MG has&#151;apart from this Agreement &#150; paid him for all wages that were due to him.<B> </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B></B>3. <B><U>Consideration</U></B>: In exchange for the promises and releases in this Agreement, and provided Brearton does not revoke the
Agreement as permitted in Section&nbsp;12 below, MG will provide Brearton with the following benefits and payments:<B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">a) Brearton
will receive his full 2015 Management Incentive Plan (&#147;MIP&#148;), to be paid at target performance for the individual performance component and actual performance for the Company performance component. This payment, less applicable deductions,
will be made no later than March&nbsp;15, 2016 at the same time 2015 MIP awards are paid to employees generally. Brearton will not be eligible to receive any other MIP payments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">b) For stock option purposes, Brearton will be considered early retirement eligible and, therefore, will be treated as an early retiree.
Brearton will have until the original expiration date to exercise outstanding vested and unexercised stock options. Any unvested stock options granted prior to January&nbsp;1, 2016 will continue to vest per the normal vesting schedule. With respect
to any restricted stock (or deferred stock units), Brearton&#146;s entire 2013 restricted stock (or deferred stock units) award and two thirds (2/3)&nbsp;of Brearton&#146;s 2014 restricted </P>

stock (or deferred stock units) award will vest on the Last Day Worked. Applicable tax withholding (and any other withholding payroll taxes) will be satisfied by deducting the number of shares
equal in value to the amount of the withholding requirements from Brearton&#146;s stock awards; therefore, the number of shares deposited into Brearton&#146;s account on the vesting date will be net of the shares used to satisfy applicable

2015-2017 performance cycle (the &#147;2015 PSUs&#148;). If such performance share units satisfy the minimum performance thresholds for an award, then Brearton will receive shares, less required deductions, based on the number of full months of
participation from the beginning of the performance cycle for the 2014 PSUs and 2015 PSUs through the Last Day Worked, at the actual business rating as determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Such
