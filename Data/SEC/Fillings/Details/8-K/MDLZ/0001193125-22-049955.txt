each Lender shall take all reasonable actions to avoid the imposition of, or reduce the amounts of, such increased costs; <U>provided</U> that such actions, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender and, to the extent possible, each Lender will calculate such increased costs based upon the capital requirements for its Advances and unused Commitment hereunder and not upon the average or general capital requirements imposed upon such
