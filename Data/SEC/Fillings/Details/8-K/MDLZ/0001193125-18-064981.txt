we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the &#147;Revolving Credit Agreement&#148;) for a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">364-day</FONT> senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5&nbsp;billion with the
lenders named in the Revolving Credit Agreement; J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, HSBC Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated as joint lead
arrangers and joint bookrunners; and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, we and certain of our
subsidiaries that we may designate may borrow up to the aggregate amount of the unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate on February&nbsp;27, 2019 (the &#147;Termination Date&#148;). We
may extend the maturity of any loans outstanding on the Termination Date to February&nbsp;26, 2020, subject to delivery of prior notice and satisfaction of other conditions. We also have the right, subject to certain conditions, to terminate in
whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective commitments of the lenders. All committed pro rata borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR or base rate, at our
election, plus an applicable margin (as determined pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement). The applicable margin will be determined by reference to the rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum shareholders&#146; equity of not less than $24.6&nbsp;billion. The Revolving Credit
Agreement&#146;s definition of minimum shareholder equity excludes accumulated other comprehensive income or losses, the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles, and any income or losses recognized in connection with the ongoing
application of any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;mark-to-market&#148;</FONT></FONT> accounting adopted in respect of pension and other retirement plans. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains customary
representations, covenants and events of default. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to use the Revolving Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes, including for working
capital purposes, and to support our commercial paper program. Some of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with us and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services,
including cash management, investment banking and trust services. In addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange and other derivatives arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. </P>
