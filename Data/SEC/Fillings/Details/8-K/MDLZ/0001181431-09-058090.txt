		Exhibit 3.1<p><p>AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS<p>of<p>KRAFT FOODS INC.<p>(Effective as of January 1, 2010)<p>ARTICLE I<p>Meetings of Shareholders<p>Section 1. Annual Meetings. - The annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, and any postponement or adjournment thereof, shall be held on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors may in its discretion determine. <p>Section 2. Special Meetings. - (a) A majority of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board may call special meetings of the shareholders. Special meetings shall be held solely for the purposes specified in the notice of meeting. (b) The Board of Directors shall call a special meeting of shareholders after the Secretary receives a valid request or requests for a special meeting of shareholders from the record holders of shares representing at least twenty percent (the "Requisite Percentage") of the combined voting power o
f the then outstanding shares of all classes of the Corporation's capital stock entitled to vote on the matter(s) proposed to be voted on at such meeting. To be valid, the request or requests must (i) be written, (ii) be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive office (the date on which the Corporate Secretary receives the request is the "Delivery Date"), (iii) include [1] the specific purpose(s) of the special meeting of shareholders and the matter(s) proposed to be voted on at the meeting, [2] the information specified in the third paragraph of Article I, Section 6 of these By-laws, and [3] documentary evidence that the requesting record holders own the Requisite Percentage at the time the Secretary receives the request and (iv) be signed and dated by the record holder(s). If the requesting record holder(s) are not the beneficial owners of the shares representing the Requisite Percentage, then to be valid, the written request must also include documentary evidence that the benefi
cial owners on whose behalf the request(s) are made (collectively, the "Requesting Holders") beneficially own the Requisite Percentage on the Delivery Date. Any shareholder who submitted a written request for a special meeting of shareholders may revoke that written request at any time by delivering a written revocation to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices. In addition, any Requesting Holder's failure to appear at the special meeting of shareholders or to send the Requesting Holder's qualified representative to the special meeting of shareholders to present such matter(s) to be voted on at the special meeting of shareholders also constitutes a revocation of such request.<p>The Corporation is not required to call a special meeting of shareholders pursuant to this Section 2(b) with respect to any matter if (x) an identical or substantially similar matter was included on the agenda of any annual or special meeting of shareholders held within 60 days prior to the Delivery Date or wil
