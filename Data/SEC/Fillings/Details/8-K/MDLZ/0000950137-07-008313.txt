<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;24, 2007, Kraft Foods Inc. (&#147;Kraft&#148;) entered into a senior unsecured 364-day revolving
credit agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
Citibank N.A., as administrative agents. The Agreement provides for borrowings by Kraft and
certain subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5&nbsp;billion. Under the Agreement,
Kraft guarantees the obligations of each subsidiary borrower. Interest on borrowings will be based
on prevailing interest rates as described in the Agreement. The Agreement has an expiration date
of May&nbsp;22, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, Kraft and the subsidiary borrowers may
borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts at any time during the term of the Agreement. The commitments
of the lenders under the Agreement will be reduced by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds
received by Kraft from certain debt or equity offerings having a maturity of greater than one year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Kraft will use the Agreement, in addition to its existing $4.5 Billion 5-Year Revolving Credit
Agreement dated as of April&nbsp;15, 2005, for general corporate purposes and to support its commercial
paper issuances. Some of the lenders under the Agreement and their affiliates have various
relationships with Kraft and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services,
including cash management, investment banking and trust services. In addition, Kraft and certain
of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange and other derivative arrangements with
certain of the lenders and their affiliates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
