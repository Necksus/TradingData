                            KRAFT FOODS INC. REPORTS
                           2001 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS

                   Pro Forma Diluted E.P.S. Up 25.0% to $0.30
                 Pro Forma Net Earnings Up 24.3% to $522 Million

Highlights:

-        Pro forma worldwide volume up 3.0%, with Kraft Foods North America up
         2.5% and Kraft Foods International up 4.4%.

-        Pro forma operating companies income up 9.8% to $1.5 billion.

-        Pro forma diluted earnings per share up 25.0% to $0.30.

-        Pro forma net earnings up 24.3% to $522 million.

-        Pro forma cash earnings per share, which exclude amortization of
         goodwill, increased 15.8% to $0.44.

-        Reported worldwide volume increased 34.6% and reported operating
         companies income increased 17.5%. However, due to the impact of the
         Nabisco acquisition on interest expense and goodwill amortization,
         reported net earnings were down 8.2% to $503 million and reported
         diluted earnings per share were down 23.7% to $0.29.

         Pro Forma results assume Kraft owned Nabisco for all of 2000, rather
         than from the actual acquisition date of December 11, 2000. In
         addition, pro forma results assume common shares outstanding of 1.735
         billion based on the assumption that shares issued immediately
         following the recent Kraft initial public offering (IPO) were
         outstanding during all periods presented and that, effective January 1,
         2000, the net proceeds of the IPO were used to retire indebtedness
         incurred to finance the Nabisco acquisition. These results also adjust
         for certain items as detailed on the last page of this release,
         including results from operations divested since the beginning of 2000.

         Reported results include the operating results of Nabisco in 2001, but
         not in 2000. Reported results also reflect average shares of common
         stock outstanding during 2001 and assume an average of 1.455 billion
         shares outstanding during 2000.

         Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for business results in
         the third quarter of 2001 versus the third quarter of 2000.

                            KRAFT FOODS INC. REPORTS
                           2001 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS

                   Pro Forma Diluted E.P.S. Up 25.0% to $0.30
                 Pro Forma Net Earnings Up 24.3% to $522 Million

         NORTHFIELD, IL - October 16, 2001 -- Kraft Foods Inc. (NYSE: KFT), a
global leader in branded foods and beverages, announced today strong results for
the third quarter, with pro forma diluted earnings per share increasing 25.0% to
$0.30 and net earnings increasing 24.3% to $522 million. Pro forma cash earnings
per share, which exclude amortization of goodwill, increased 15.8% to $0.44.

         "Kraft's continued strong performance was driven by a balance of three
factors - higher volume from new products and in developing markets, cost
savings from productivity and synergies, and lower interest expense," said Roger
K. Deromedi, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Kraft Foods.

         "Our results in the quarter are on target and keep us in line with our
full-year 2001 projections," said Betsy D. Holden, Co-Chief Executive Officer of
Kraft Foods. "For this year we continue to expect pro forma diluted earnings per
share in the range of $1.18 to $1.21 based on 1.735 billion shares outstanding.
On a pro forma diluted cash basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of
$1.74 to $1.77." The impact of currency, as well as other factors described
<PAGE>
in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release, are
risks to these projections.

         During the quarter, Kraft declared its first regular quarterly dividend
of $0.13 per common share.


Nabisco Integration

         "Around the world, the integration of Nabisco is proceeding smoothly
and meeting expectations," Deromedi said. "We're starting to see the power of
joint promotions and cross-branding initiatives," Holden added, "and we're on
track to capture $100 million in net cost synergy savings this year."


Reported Results

         On a reported basis, worldwide volume increased 34.6%; operating
revenues increased 29.6% to $8.1 billion; and operating companies income
increased 17.5% to $1.5 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Nabisco. Net
earnings decreased 8.2% to $503 million and diluted earnings per share decreased
23.7% to $0.29 as a result of higher interest expense and goodwill amortization
from the Nabisco acquisition. Included in reported results for the third quarter
are $37 million of costs to consolidate production lines in the U.S. These costs
are part of the previously communicated $200-$300 million in estimated charges
for Kraft site closures, reconfigurations and other consolidation programs
associated with integrating Kraft and Nabisco.


Pro Forma Results

         Pro forma worldwide volume increased 3.0%; operating revenues decreased
0.7%, as the favorable impact of volume growth was more than offset by the
adverse effect of currency, lower coffee prices and product mix. Operating
companies income increased 9.8%; net earnings increased 24.3% due to growth in
operating companies income and reduced interest expense; diluted earnings per
share increased 25.0%; and diluted cash earnings per share increased 15.8%.
Excluding unfavorable currency impacts, operating revenues would have increased
1.3% and operating companies income would have been up 10.8%.

To allow for a more meaningful comparison of business results for the third
quarter of 2001 versus the third quarter of 2000, the following discussion is on
a pro forma basis.

                                      -2-

                            KRAFT FOODS NORTH AMERICA

         Volume for Kraft Foods North America (KFNA) increased 2.5%, due
primarily to strong results in the Beverages, Desserts and Cereals segment and
the Oscar Mayer and Pizza segment, as well as contributions from successful new
products. Operating revenues increased 0.5% as the favorable impact of stronger
volume was partially offset by the adverse impact of currency in Canada, lower
coffee pricing due to declines in coffee commodity costs and product mix.
Operating companies income improved a strong 10.2%, driven by volume growth and
productivity and Nabisco cost synergy savings, partially offset by higher dairy
commodity costs.

         Following are results by segment for KFNA:

         Cheese, Meals and Enhancers volume was 0.9% below prior year due to the
company's decision to exit lower-margin, non-branded businesses in both cheese
and U.S. Foodservice. Excluding these initiatives, volume increased 0.5%.
Operating companies income increased 3.6% for this segment with gains in Meals,
Enhancers, Canada and Foodservice, partially offset by the adverse impact of
higher dairy commodity costs in the Cheese business. Meals recorded strong
volume gains in Kraft macaroni and cheese dinners. Shipments in Canada also
increased, driven by continued momentum from new products, including Kraft
Delissio frozen pizza.

         Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery volume was down 0.3%. Operating
companies income increased a strong 26.4%, due primarily to productivity and
synergy savings. Biscuits recorded volume gains, led by continued momentum in
crackers and pet snacks and the successful introduction of Chocolate Creme
Oreos. In salty snacks, volume declined as a result of lower shipments of
Planters nuts to non-grocery channels. Shipments were also lower in the
Confectionery business versus a strong year-ago period.

         Beverages, Desserts and Cereals volume increased 9.6%, driven by
continued momentum in ready-to-drink beverages. Operating companies income
improved by 11.0% driven by the increase in volume. Double-digit volume gains in
ready-to-drink beverages resulted from the continued success of new products,
including Capri Sun Big Pouch and Crystal Light in bottles. Shipments of
Kool-Aid and Country Time powdered soft drinks also increased, due to strong
merchandising programs. In Desserts, volume was down in Jell-O dry packaged
desserts, partially offset by gains in ready-to-eat desserts, aided by the
launch of Jell-O Oreo pudding. Post cereal volume declined due primarily to
increased competition in the ready-to-eat cereal category.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
         Oscar Mayer and Pizza volume increased 3.2% with gains across all major
categories. Operating companies income increased 7.5%, resulting from volume
gains, partially offset by higher meat and cheese costs. The processed meats
business recorded volume gains in luncheon meats, hot dogs, Lunchables and Boca
meat alternatives. Shipments of frozen pizza also increased, aided by the
successful introduction of DiGiorno stuffed crust pizza and Tombstone
Mexican-style pizza.

                            KRAFT FOODS INTERNATIONAL

         Volume for Kraft Foods International (KFI) increased 4.4%, benefiting
from gains across most key sectors and driven by a 12.1% growth in the
developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia
Pacific. Operating companies income increased 8.2%, driven by volume growth,
continued productivity savings and Nabisco cost synergies. Excluding an
unfavorable currency impact of $11 million, operating companies income would
have increased 12.5%. Operating revenues decreased 4.1%. Excluding the negative
currency impact, revenues increased 2.7% with the impact of higher volume
moderated by lower coffee pricing due to declining commodity costs.

         Following are results by segment for KFI:

         Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) volume was in-line with prior
year, as double-digit gains in the developing markets of Central and Eastern
Europe and growth in Austria, Greece, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United
Kingdom were offset by lower volumes in Germany and Italy. Operating companies
income increased 0.5% including an unfavorable currency impact of $7.0 million.
Excluding negative currency, operating companies income would have increased
4.0%.

         Snacks volume increased, driven by favorable confectionery and salty
snacks performance. Confectionery volume was above last year, reflecting growth
of Milka in Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain and the Ukraine; Cote d'Or in
Belgium and Italy; Marabou in Sweden and Korona in the Ukraine. Successful new
product introductions included the Milka 100-year anniversary praline box in
Germany; Terry's chocolate orange mini segments in a tub in the United Kingdom
and Milka line extensions across Europe. Germany volume was lower, due to
increased price competition and trade inventory reductions. Double-digit volume
growth in salty snacks was driven by successful Estrella

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
promotions in Lithuania and the strong performance of Lux and Estrella brands in
the Ukraine.

         Volume growth in beverages was driven by favorable performance in both
coffee and refreshment beverages. Coffee volume increases were led by Hag in
Austria and Italy; Jacobs in Poland, Lithuania and the Ukraine; Kenco Rappor and
Maxwell House in the United Kingdom as well as recent coffee acquisitions in
Bulgaria, Romania and Morocco. In Germany, coffee volume declined reflecting
continued trade inventory reductions. Refreshment beverages volume grew, driven
by higher Tang shipments to the Middle East and Africa.

         Cheese volume was lower, as favorable Philadelphia cream cheese
performance in Belgium, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Away from Home
markets was more than offset by lower volume in Germany, reflecting increased
price competition.

         In Convenient Meals, volume was down as lower canned meats volume in
Italy was partly offset by the continued momentum of new Dairylea Lunchables
products in the United Kingdom.

         During the quarter, KFI announced its agreement to purchase the Central
and Eastern European confectionery business of Stollwerck AG. This acquisition
is subject to regulatory approvals in the respective countries.

         Latin America and Asia Pacific (LAAP) volume increased 10.7%, driven by
gains in Australia, Brazil, China, Peru and the Philippines, partially offset by
a decline in Argentina due to economic weakness. Operating companies income
increased 34.5%, driven by higher volume, productivity and Nabisco synergies.

         In snacks, volume was higher, driven by successful marketing programs
for Club Social crackers and line extensions of Trakinas cookies in Brazil,
higher sales of Chips Ahoy!, Trakinas and Marbu cookies in China and gains in
Club Social crackers and Oreo cookies in Peru.

         Double-digit volume growth in beverages was driven by the strong
performance of Tang, Fresh and Clight powdered soft drinks and Maguary juice
concentrate in Brazil, as well as successful marketing programs and improved
distribution of Tang in the Philippines.

         Cheese volume also grew strongly, driven by higher Philadelphia cream
cheese shipments in Australia and successful marketing programs for Kraft Cheez
Whiz and Eden process cheese in the Philippines.

</TABLE>

* Relates to sales of products that would normally have occurred in January
2000, but were made in 1999 in order for the Company's customers to avoid
potential problems related to the Century Date Change. These sales were
previously excluded from the underlying 1999 fourth quarter results.

In addition, operating results of businesses sold since the beginning of 2000
are excluded from underlying operating revenues and operating companies income
(but not from underlying net earnings or earnings per share). Several
international food and domestic food operations were divested since the
beginning of 2000. No assumptions were made as to the application of proceeds
from the sales of any operations.


Operating revenues and operating companies income for all periods presented were
restated to reflect the transfer of management responsibility for Mexico and
Puerto Rico from the international food business to the North American food
business.
