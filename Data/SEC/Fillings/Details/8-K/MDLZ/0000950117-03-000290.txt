                 December 31, 2002 and 2001 and for Each of the

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
                        ---------------------------------



To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
     Kraft Foods Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Kraft
Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1,
2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

                        KRAFT FOODS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               ------------------

Note 1. Background and Basis of Presentation:
- ---------------------------------------------

  Background:
     Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of
      Virginia. Following Kraft's formation, Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip
      Morris Companies Inc.), transferred to Kraft its ownership interest in
      Kraft Foods North America, Inc. ("KFNA"), a Delaware corporation, through
      a capital contribution. In addition, during 2000, a subsidiary of Altria
      Group, Inc., transferred management responsibility for its food businesses
      in Latin America to KFNA and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kraft Foods
      International, Inc. ("KFI"). Kraft, through its subsidiaries (Kraft and
      its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), is engaged
      in the manufacture and sale of branded foods and beverages in the United
      States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Middle East and
      Africa.

     On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
      Nabisco Holdings Corp. ("Nabisco") for $55 per share in cash. See Note 5.
      Acquisitions for a complete discussion of this transaction.

     Prior to June 13, 2001, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria
      Group, Inc. On June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public
      offering ("IPO") of 280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a
      price of $31.00 per share. The IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting
      discount and expenses, of $8.4 billion were used to retire a portion of an
      $11.0 billion long-term note payable to Altria Group, Inc., incurred in
      connection with the acquisition of Nabisco. After the IPO, Altria Group,
      Inc. owned approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's
      capital stock through its ownership of 49.5% of the Company's Class A
      common stock and 100% of the Company's Class B common stock. The Company's
      Class A common stock has one vote per share, while the Company's Class B
      common stock has ten votes per share. At December 31, 2002, Altria Group,
      Inc. held 97.8% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding
      capital stock and owned approximately 84.2% of the outstanding shares of
      the Company's capital stock.

  Basis of presentation:
     The consolidated financial statements include Kraft and its subsidiaries.
      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
      management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
      amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
      liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported
      amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
      Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension
      and benefit plan assumptions and income taxes. Actual results could differ
      from those estimates. The Company's operating subsidiaries report year-end
      results as of the Saturday closest to the end of each year. This resulted
      in fifty-three weeks of operating results in the Company's consolidated
      statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
      current year's presentation, due primarily to the adoption of new
      accounting rules regarding revenues, as well as the disclosure of more
      detailed information on the consolidated statements of earnings and the
      consolidated statements of cash flows.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
- ---------------------------------------------------

  Cash and cash equivalents:
     Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid
      investments with original maturities of three months or less.

                               ------------------

  Depreciation, amortization and goodwill valuation:
     Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated
      by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
      Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20
      years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years.

     On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142,
      "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." As a result, the Company stopped
      recording the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible
      assets as a charge to earnings as of January 1, 2002. Net earnings and
      diluted earnings per share ("EPS") would have been as follows had the
      provisions of the new standards been applied as of January 1, 2000:

     In addition, the Company is required to conduct an annual review of
      goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment. In 2002, the
      Company completed its review and did not have to record a charge to
      earnings for an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.

     At December 31, 2002, goodwill by reportable segment was as follows (in
      millions):

                               ------------------

     Intangible assets as of December 31, 2002 were as follows:

     Non-amortizable intangible assets          $11,485
     Amortizable intangible assets                   54              $30

            Total intangible assets             $11,539              $30
                                                =======              ===
</TABLE>

     Non-amortizable intangible assets are substantially comprised of brand
      names purchased through the Nabisco acquisition. Amortizable intangible
      assets consist primarily of certain trademark licenses and non-compete
      agreements. Pre-tax amortization expense for intangible assets was $7
      million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Based upon the amortizable
      intangible assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at December
      31, 2002, amortization expense for each of the next five years is
      estimated to be $8 million or less.

     The increase in goodwill and other intangible assets, net, during the year
      ended December 31, 2002, of $463 million is primarily related to currency
      translation, partially offset by a $76 million decrease in goodwill
      relating to the favorable completion of severance and exit programs
      associated with the Nabisco acquisition.

  Environmental costs:
     The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection
      of the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with
      environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such
      amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are
      adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.

     While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of
      actions regarding environmental remediation and compliance efforts that
      the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management,
      environmental remediation and compliance costs, before taking into account
      any recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect
      on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or
      cash flows.

  Foreign currency translation:
     The Company translates the results of operations of its foreign
      subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas
      balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of
      each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component
      of shareholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in the
      consolidated statements of earnings and were not significant for any of
      the periods presented.

  Guarantees:
     In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
      Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
      for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others."
      Interpretation No. 45 requires the disclosure of certain guarantees
      existing at December 31, 2002. In addition, Interpretation No. 45 requires
      the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of
      qualifying guarantee activities that are initiated or modified after
      December 31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company will apply the recognition
      provisions of Interpretation No. 45

                               ------------------

      prospectively to guarantee activities initiated after December 31, 2002.
      See Note 17. Contingencies for a further discussion of guarantees.

  Hedging instruments:
     Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and its related
      amendment, SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments
      and Certain Hedging Activities" (collectively referred to as "SFAS No.
      133"). These standards require that all derivative financial instruments
      be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value as
      either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are
      recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive losses or
      in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective
      as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge
      transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in
      accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) are reclassified to the
      consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating
      results are affected by the hedged item. Cash flow hedging instruments are
      classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the
      consolidated statements of cash flows. As of January 1, 2001, the adoption
      of these new standards did not have a material effect on net earnings
      (less than $1 million) or accumulated other comprehensive losses (less
      than $1 million).

  Impairment of long-lived assets:
     The Company reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible
      assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
      fully recoverable. The Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow
      analyses to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is
      determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on
      fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are
      based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
      for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which replaces SFAS
      No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
      Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 144 provides updated
      guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss
      for certain types of long-lived assets, expands the scope of a
      discontinued operation to include a component of an entity and eliminates
      the exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to
      be temporary. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material
      impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of
      operations or cash flows.

  Income taxes:
     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
      "Accounting for Income Taxes." The accounts of the Company are included in
      the consolidated federal income tax return of Altria Group, Inc. Income
      taxes are generally computed on a separate company basis. To the extent
      that foreign tax credits, capital losses and other credits generated by
      the Company, which cannot be utilized on a separate company basis, are
      utilized in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return,
      the benefit is recognized in the calculation of the Company's provision
      for income taxes. The Company utilized tax benefits that it would
      otherwise not have been able to use of $193 million, $185 million and $139
      million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
      respectively. The Company makes payments to, or is reimbursed by, Altria
      Group, Inc., for the tax effects resulting from its inclusion in Altria
      Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return.

                   NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               ------------------

  Inventories:
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The last-in,
      first-out ("LIFO") method is used to cost substantially all domestic
      inventories. The cost of other inventories is principally determined by
      the average cost method.

  Marketing costs:
     The Company promotes its products with significant marketing activities,
      including advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions.
      Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade
      promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on
      amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a
      period, based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates.

  Revenue recognition:
     The Company recognizes revenues, net of sales incentives and including
      shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment of goods
      when title and risk of loss pass to customers. Shipping and handling costs
      are classified as part of cost of sales.

     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Emerging Issues Task
      Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives"
      and EITF Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of
      Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." Prior period
      consolidated statements of earnings have been reclassified to reflect the
      adoption. The adoption of these EITF Issues resulted in a reduction of
      revenues of approximately $4.6 billion and $3.6 billion in 2001 and 2000,
      respectively. In addition, the adoption reduced marketing, administration
      and research costs by $4.7 billion and $3.7 billion in 2001 and 2000,
      respectively, while cost of sales increased by an insignificant amount.
      The adoption of these EITF Issues had no impact on operating income, net
      earnings or basic and diluted EPS.

  Software costs:
     The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development
      costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer
      software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a
      straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
      do not exceed five years.

  Stock-based compensation:
     The Company accounts for employee stock compensation plans in accordance
      with the intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123,
      "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which did not result in
      compensation cost for stock options.

     At December 31, 2002, the Company had stock-based employee compensation
      plans, which are described more fully in Note 10. Stock Plans. The Company
      applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
      Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
      Employees," and related Interpretations in accounting for those plans. No
      compensation expense for employee stock options is reflected in net
      earnings as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price
      equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant.
      Net earnings, as reported, includes compensation expense related to

  New accounting pronouncements:
     In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
      Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires
      companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities
      when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit
      or disposal plan. Costs covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination
      costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a
      restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing or other exit or
      disposal activity. This statement is effective for exit or disposal
      activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Accordingly, the
      Company will apply the provisions of SFAS No. 146 prospectively to exit or
      disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

     In November 2002, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue
      Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," which addresses certain aspects
      of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform
      multiple revenue-generating activities. Specifically, EITF Issue No. 00-21
      addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
      deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting. EITF Issue No.
      00-21 is effective for the Company for revenue arrangements entered into
      beginning July 1, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF
      Issue No. 00-21 to have a material impact on its 2003 consolidated
      financial statements.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
      Variable Interest Entities." Interpretation No. 46 requires that the
      assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest
      entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that
      has the controlling financial interest. Interpretation No. 46 also
      provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity
      should be consolidated based on voting interests or significant financial
      support provided to it. Interpretation No. 46 will be effective for the
      Company on February 1, 2003 for variable interest entities created after
      January 31, 2003, and on July 1, 2003 for variable interest entities
      created prior to February 1, 2003. The Company does not expect the
      adoption of Interpretation No. 46 to have a material impact on its 2003
      consolidated financial statements.

      formal agreement with Altria Corporate Services, Inc., providing for a
      continuation of these services, the cost of which increased $91 million
      during 2001 as Altria Corporate Services, Inc., provided information
      technology and financial services, all of which were previously performed
      by the Company at approximately the same cost. Billings for these
      services, which were based on the cost to Altria Corporate Services, Inc.
      to provide such services and a management fee, were $327 million, $339
      million and $248 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
      2000, respectively. These costs were paid to Altria Corporate Services,
      Inc. monthly. Although the cost of these services cannot be quantified on
      a stand-alone basis, management believes that the billings are reasonable
      based on the level of support provided by Altria Corporate Services, Inc.,
      and that they reflect all services provided. The cost and nature of the
      services are reviewed annually by the Company's audit committee, which is
      comprised of independent directors. The effects of these transactions are
      included in operating cash flows in the Company's consolidated statements
      of cash flows.

     In addition, the Company's daily net cash or overdraft position is
      transferred to Altria Group, Inc., or its European subsidiary. The Company
      pays or receives interest based upon the applicable London Interbank
      Offered Rate, on the amounts payable to, or receivable from, Altria Group,
      Inc., or its European subsidiary.

     The Company also has long-term notes payable to Altria Group, Inc. and its

</TABLE>

     The 7.0% notes have no prepayment penalty. During 2002, the Company prepaid
      $3,850 million of the 7.0% long-term notes payable. In addition, at
      December 31, 2002, the Company has short-term debt totaling $2,305 million
      to Altria Group, Inc. Interest on these borrowings is based on the average
      one-month London Interbank Offered Rate. A portion of the debt, totaling
      $1,410 million, was reclassified on the consolidated balance sheet as
      long-term notes due to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates based upon the
      Company's ability and intention to refinance on a long-term basis.

     Based on interest rates available to the Company for issuances of debt with
      similar terms and remaining maturities, the aggregate fair value of the
      Company's long-term notes payable to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates, at
      December 31, 2002 and 2001, were $2,764 million and $5,325 million,
      respectively. The fair values of the Company's current amounts due to
      Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates approximate carrying amounts.

Note 4. Divestitures:
- ---------------------

     During 2002, the Company sold several small North American food businesses,
      some of which were previously classified as businesses held for sale. The
      net revenues and operating results of the businesses held for sale, which
      were not significant, were excluded from the Company's consolidated
      statements of earnings, and no gain or loss was recognized on these sales.
      In addition, the Company sold its Latin American yeast and industrial
      bakery ingredients business for approximately $110 million and recorded a
      pre-tax gain of $69 million. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of
      businesses were $219 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains
      of $80 million.

     During 2001, the Company sold several small food businesses. The aggregate
      proceeds received in these transactions were $21 million, on which the
      Company recorded pre-tax gains of $8 million.

     During 2000, the Company sold a French confectionery business for proceeds
      of $251 million, on which a pre-tax gain of $139 million was recorded.
      Several small international and North American food businesses were also
      sold in 2000. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses
      were $300 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $172
      million.

     The operating results of the businesses sold were not material to the
      Company's consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented.

Note 5. Acquisitions:
- ---------------------

     Nabisco

     On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
      Nabisco for $55 per share in cash. The purchase of the outstanding shares,
      retirement of employee stock options and other payments totaled
      approximately $15.2 billion. In addition, the acquisition included the
      assumption of approximately $4.0 billion of existing Nabisco debt. The
      Company financed the acquisition through the issuance of two long-term
      notes payable to Altria Group, Inc., totaling $15.0 billion, and
      short-term intercompany borrowings of $255 million. The acquisition has
      been accounted for as a purchase. Beginning January 1, 2001, Nabisco's
      earnings have been included in the consolidated operating results of the
      Company. The Company's interest cost associated with acquiring Nabisco has
      been included in interest and other debt expense, net, on the Company's
      consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2002,
      2001 and 2000.

     During 2001, the Company completed the allocation of excess purchase price
      relating to Nabisco. As a result, the Company recorded, among other
      things, the final valuations of property, plant and equipment and
      intangible assets, primarily trade names, amounts relating to the closure
      of Nabisco facilities and related deferred income taxes. The final
      allocation of excess purchase price at December 31, 2001 was as follows

                   NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               ------------------

     Goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2001 included
      approximately $11.7 billion related to trade names. The Company also
      recorded deferred federal income taxes of $3.9 billion related to trade
      names. During 2002, the Company decreased goodwill by $76 million due
      primarily to the favorable completion of the severance and exit programs.

     The closure of a number of Nabisco domestic and international facilities
      resulted in severance and other exit costs of $379 million, which are
      included in the above adjustments for the allocation of the Nabisco
      purchase price. The closures will result in the termination of
      approximately 7,500 employees and will require total cash payments of $373
      million, of which approximately $190 million has been spent through
      December 31, 2002. Substantially all of the closures were completed as of
      December 31, 2002, and the remaining payments relate to salary
      continuation payments for severed employees and lease payments.

     The integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company has also
      resulted in the closure or reconfiguration of several of the Company's
      existing facilities. The aggregate charges to the Company's consolidated
      statement of earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and integrate
      Nabisco were originally estimated to be in the range of $200 million to
      $300 million. During 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax integration
      related charges of $115 million to consolidate production lines, close
      facilities and for other consolidation programs. In addition, during 2001,
      the Company incurred pre-tax integration costs of $53 million for site
      reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the United States.
      The integration related charges of $168 million included $27 million
      relating to severance, $117 million relating to asset write-offs and $24
      million relating to other cash exit costs. Cash payments relating to these
      charges will approximate $51 million, of which $21 million has been paid
      through December 31, 2002. In addition, during 2002, approximately 700
      salaried employees elected to retire or terminate employment under
      voluntary retirement programs. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax
      charge of $142 million related to these programs. As of December 31, 2002,
      the aggregate pre-tax charges to close or reconfigure the Company's
      facilities, including charges for early retirement programs, were $310
      million, slightly above the original estimate. No additional pre-tax
      charges are expected to be recorded for these programs.

     During 2001, certain small Nabisco businesses were reclassified to
      businesses held for sale, including their estimated results of operations
      through anticipated sale dates. These businesses have subsequently been
      sold, with the exception of one business that had been held for sale since
      the acquisition of Nabisco. This business, which is no longer held for
      sale has been included in 2002 consolidated operating results.

     Assuming the acquisition of Nabisco occurred at the beginning of 2000, pro
      forma net revenues would have been approximately $30 billion and pro forma
      net earnings would have been $1.4 billion in 2000; while 2000 basic and
      diluted EPS would have been $0.96. These pro forma results, which are
      unaudited, do not give effect to any synergies expected to result from the
      merger of Nabisco's operations with those of the Company, nor do they give
      effect to the reduction of interest expense from the repayment of
      borrowings with the proceeds from the IPO. The pro forma results also do
      not reflect the effects of SFAS No. 141 and 142 on the amortization of
      goodwill or other intangible assets. The pro forma results are not
      necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred if the
      acquisition had been consummated and the IPO completed at the beginning of
      2000, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated operating
      results.

     Other Acquisitions

     During 2002, the Company acquired a snacks business in Turkey and a
      biscuits business in Australia. The total cost of these and other smaller
      acquisitions was $122 million.

     During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco
      and Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in Russia and
      Poland. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $194
      million.

     During 2000, the Company purchased Balance Bar Co. and Boca Burger, Inc.
      The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $365 million.

     The effects of these acquisitions were not material to the Company's
      consolidated financial position or results of operations in any of the
      periods presented.

Note 6. Inventories:
- --------------------

     The cost of approximately 49% and 54% of inventories in 2002 and 2001,
      respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The stated LIFO
      amounts of inventories were approximately $215 million and $150 million
      higher than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
      respectively.

Note 7. Short-Term Borrowings and Borrowing Arrangements:
- ---------------------------------------------------------

     At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had short-term borrowings of
      $1,621 million and $2,681 million, respectively, consisting principally of
      commercial paper borrowings with an average year-end interest rate of 1.3%
      and 1.9%, respectively. Of these amounts, the Company reclassified $1,401
      million and $2,000 million, respectively, of the commercial paper
      borrowings to long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to
      refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis.

     The fair values of the Company's short-term borrowings at December 31, 2002
      and 2001, based upon current market interest rates, approximate the
      amounts disclosed above.

     The Company has a $2.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility maturing in
      July 2006 and a $3.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility maturing in
      July 2003. The Company intends to use these credit facilities to support
      commercial paper borrowings, the proceeds of which will be used for
      general corporate purposes. None of these facilities were drawn at
      December 31, 2002. These facilities require the maintenance of a minimum
      net worth. The Company met this covenant at December 31, 2002. In
      addition, the Company maintains credit lines with a number of lending
      institutions amounting to approximately $577 million. The Company
      maintains these credit lines primarily to meet the short-term working
      capital needs of its international businesses. The foregoing revolving
      credit facilities do not include any other financial tests, any credit
      rating triggers or any provisions that could require the posting of
      collateral.

      where options to purchase the Company's Class A common stock are granted.

      Class A common shares and all of the Class B common shares at December 31,
      2002. There are no preferred shares issued and outstanding. Class A common
      shares are entitled to one vote each, while Class B common shares are
      entitled to ten votes each. Therefore, Altria Group, Inc. holds 97.8% of

      subsidiaries received a one-time grant of options to purchase shares of
      the Company's Class A common stock held by Altria Group, Inc. at the IPO
      price of $31.00 per share. In order to completely satisfy this obligation
      and maintain its current percentage ownership of the Company, Altria
      Group, Inc. purchased 1.6 million shares of the Company's Class A common
      stock in open market transactions during 2002.

Note 10. Stock Plans:
- ---------------------

     The Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2001 Kraft Performance
      Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which was established concurrently with the
      IPO. Under the Plan, the Company may grant stock options, stock
      appreciation rights, restricted stock, reload options and other awards
      based on the Company's Class A common stock, as well as performance-based
      annual and long-term incentive awards. A maximum of 75 million shares of
      the Company's Class A common stock may be issued under the Plan. The
      Company's Board of Directors granted options for 21,029,777 shares of
      Class A common stock concurrent with the closing date of the IPO (June 13,
      2001) at an exercise price equal to the IPO price of $31.00 per share. A
      portion of the shares granted (18,904,637) becomes exercisable on January
      31, 2003, and will expire ten years from the date of the grant. The
      remainder of the shares granted (2,125,140) may become exercisable on a
      schedule based on total shareholder return for the Company's Class A
      common stock during the three years following the date of the grant, or
      will become exercisable five years from the date of the grant. These
      options will also expire ten years from the date of the grant. Shares
      available to be granted under the Plan at December 31, 2002 were
      56,135,543.

     The Company's Board of Directors has also adopted the Kraft Director Plan.
      Under the Kraft Director Plan, awards are granted only to members of the
      Board of Directors who are not full-time employees of the Company or
      Altria Group, Inc., or their subsidiaries. Up to 500,000 shares of Class A
      common stock may be awarded under the Kraft Director Plan. During 2002 and
      2001, 6,840 and 8,945 stock options were granted under the Kraft Director
      Plan, respectively. Shares available to be granted under the Kraft
      Director Plan at December 31, 2002 were 484,215.

      currently intend to issue additional Altria Group, Inc. stock compensation
      to the Company's employees, except for reloads of previously issued
      options. Altria Group, Inc. accounts for its plans in accordance with the
      intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
      Stock-Based Compensation," which did not result in compensation cost for
      stock options.

     The Company's employees held options to purchase the following number of

     Had compensation cost for stock option awards under the Kraft plans and
      Altria Group, Inc. plans been determined by using the fair value at the

      was determined using a modified Black-Scholes methodology and the
      following assumptions:

     In addition, certain of the Company's employees held shares of Altria
      Group, Inc. restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock, giving
      these employees in most instances all of the rights of shareholders,
      except that they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such
      shares and rights. These shares and rights are subject to forfeiture if
      certain employment conditions are not met. During 2001 and 2000, Altria
      Group, Inc. granted to certain of the Company's U.S. employees restricted
      stock of 279,120 shares and 2,113,570 shares, respectively. Altria Group,
      Inc. also issued to certain of the Company's non-U.S. employees rights to
      receive 31,310 and 683,790 equivalent shares during 2001 and 2000,
      respectively. At December 31, 2002, restrictions on the stock, net of
      forfeitures, lapse as follows: 2003--84,000 shares. The fair value of the
      restricted shares and rights at the date of grant is amortized to expense
      ratably over the restriction period through a charge from Altria Group,
      Inc. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded compensation expense
      related to restricted stock awards of $4 million, $39 million and $23
      million, respectively.

Note 13. Segment Reporting:
- ---------------------------

     The Company manufactures and markets packaged retail food products,
      consisting principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals and
      various packaged grocery products through KFNA and KFI. Reportable
      segments for KFNA are organized and managed principally by product
      category. KFNA's segments are Cheese, Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits,
      Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages, Desserts and Cereals; and Oscar Mayer
      and Pizza. KFNA's food service business within the United States and its
      businesses in Canada and Mexico are reported through the Cheese, Meals and
      Enhancers segment. KFI's operations are organized and managed by
      geographic location. KFI's segments are Europe, Middle East and Africa;
      and Latin America and Asia Pacific.

     The Company's management reviews operating companies income to evaluate
      segment performance and allocate resources. Operating companies income
      excludes general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.
      Interest and other debt expense, net, and provision for income taxes are
      centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented by
      segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability
      reviewed by management. The Company's assets, which are principally in the
      United States and Europe, are managed geographically. The accounting
      policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of
      Significant Accounting Policies.

Note 14. Benefit Plans:
- -----------------------

     The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
      substantially all U.S. employees. Pension coverage for employees of
      Kraft's non-U.S. subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed
      appropriate, through separate plans, many of which are governed by local
      statutory requirements. In addition, Kraft's U.S. and Canadian
      subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to substantially all
      retired employees. Health care benefits for retirees outside the United
      States and Canada are generally covered through local government plans.

     During 2002, certain salaried employees in the United States left the
      Company under a voluntary early retirement program instituted in 2001.
      This resulted in special termination benefits and curtailment and
      settlement losses of $109 million in 2002. In addition, retiring employees
      elected lump-sum payments, resulting in settlement losses of $21 million
      in 2002 and settlement gains of $12 million and $34 million in 2001 and
      2000, respectively.

      balance sheets at December 31, 2002 and 2001, as prepaid pension assets of
      $2,814 million and $2,675 million, respectively, for those plans in which
      plan assets exceeded their accumulated benefit obligations and as other
      liabilities of $1,123 million and $879 million at December 31, 2002 and
      2001, respectively, for plans in which the accumulated benefit obligations
      exceeded their plan assets.

     At December 31, 2002 and 2001, certain of the Company's U.S. plans were
      under funded, with projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit
      obligations and the fair value of plan assets of $269 million, $217
      million and $45 million, respectively, in 2002 and $213 million, $164
      million and $15 million, respectively, in 2001. For certain non-U.S.
      plans, which have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan
      assets, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
      and fair value of plan assets were $1,375 million, $1,250 million and $424
      million, respectively, as of December 31, 2002 and $1,165 million, $1,073
      million and $416 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2001.

     SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," permits the delayed
      recognition of pension fund gains and losses in ratable periods of up to
      five years. The Company uses a four-year period wherein pension fund gains
      and losses are reflected in the pension calculation at 25% per year,
      beginning the year after the gains or losses occur. Recent stock market
      declines have resulted in deferred losses. The amortization of these
      deferred losses will result in higher pension cost in future periods.

     Kraft and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor employee savings plans, to
      which the Company contributes. These plans cover certain salaried,
      non-union and union employees. The Company's contributions and costs are
      determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the
      plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled
      $64 million, $63 million and $43 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
      respectively.

     During 2002, certain salaried employees in the United States left the

</TABLE>

     The current portion of the Company's accrued postretirement health care
      costs of $172 million and $175 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
      respectively, are included in other accrued liabilities on the
      consolidated balance sheets.

     The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
      postretirement benefit obligation for U.S. plans was 6.8% in 2001, 6.2% in
      2002 and 8.0% in 2003, gradually declining to 5.0% by the year 2006 and
      remaining at that level thereafter. For Canadian plans, the assumed health
      care cost trend rate was 9.0% in 2001, 8.0% in 2002 and 7.0% in 2003,
      gradually declining to 4.0% by the year 2006 and remaining at that level
      thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care
      cost trend rates for each year would increase the accumulated
      postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2002, and
      postretirement health care cost (service cost and interest cost) for the
      year then ended by approximately 8.8% and 11.9%, respectively. A
      one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates
      for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit
      obligation as of December 31, 2002, and postretirement health care cost
      (service cost and interest cost) for the year then ended by approximately
      7.3% and 10.0%, respectively.

     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligations for U.S. plans at
      December 31, 2002 and 2001 were determined using an assumed discount rate
      of 6.5% and 7.0%, respectively. The accumulated postretirement benefit
      obligations for Canadian plans at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were
      determined using an assumed discount rate of 6.75%.

     Assumption changes of $193 million at December 31, 2002 relate primarily to
      lowering the discount rate from 7.0% to 6.5% and to increasing the medical
      trend rate for the years 2003 through 2005 in consideration of current
      medical inflation trends. Assumption changes of $180 million at December
      31, 2001 relate primarily to lowering the discount rate from 7.75% to
      7.0%.

Postemployment Benefit Plans

     Kraft and certain of its affiliates sponsor postemployment benefit plans

     The accumulated benefit obligation was determined using an assumed ultimate
      annual turnover rate of 0.3% in 2002 and 2001, assumed compensation cost
      increases of 4.0% in 2002 and 4.5% in 2001, and assumed benefits as
      defined in the respective plans. Postemployment costs arising from actions
      that offer employees benefits in excess of those specified in the
      respective plans are charged to expense when incurred.

Note 16. Financial Instruments:
- -------------------------------

     Derivative financial instruments

     The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in
      various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial
      instruments to manage its foreign currency and commodity exposures, which
      primarily relate to forecasted transactions. Derivative financial
      instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposures to
      market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
      commodity prices by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a
      party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use financial
      instruments for speculative purposes. Financial instruments qualifying for
      hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between
      the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and
      throughout the hedged period. The Company formally documents the nature of
      and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as
      well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the
      various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness.
      Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant
      characteristics and expected terms of a forecasted transaction must be
      specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted
      transaction will occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted
      transaction will not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in
      earnings currently.

                        KRAFT FOODS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               ------------------

     Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are
      effective as hedges under SFAS No. 133. The fair value of all derivative
      financial instruments has been calculated based on market quotes.

     The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency
      options to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
      rates from third-party and intercompany forecasted transactions. The
      primary currencies to which the Company is exposed include the Euro,
      British pound and Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
      Company had option and forward foreign exchange contracts with aggregate
      notional amounts of $575 million and $431 million, respectively, which are
      comprised of contracts for the purchase and sale of foreign currencies.
      The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with
      forward contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other
      comprehensive earnings (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions
      are reported on the Company's consolidated statement of earnings.

     The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of
      certain commodities used as raw materials by the Company's businesses.
      Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward contracts, as cash flow
      hedges, primarily for coffee, cocoa, milk and cheese. Commodity futures
      and options are also used to hedge the price of certain commodities,
      including milk, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn, sugar and soybean oil. In
      general, commodity forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase
      exception under SFAS No. 133 and are, therefore, not subject to the
      provisions of SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had
      net long commodity positions of $544 million and $589 million,
      respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on net commodity positions were
      immaterial at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The effective portion of
      unrealized gains and losses on commodity futures and option contracts is
      deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings
      (losses) and is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the
      Company's consolidated statement of earnings when the related inventory is
      sold.

     Derivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive
      earnings (losses) are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers
      of these gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive earnings
      (losses) to earnings are offset by corresponding gains or losses on the
      underlying hedged items. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and
      2001, ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges was not material. At
      December 31, 2002, the Company is hedging forecasted transactions for
      periods not exceeding fifteen months and expects substantially all amounts
      reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to be
      reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings within the next
      twelve months.

     Credit exposure and credit risk

     The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
      counterparties. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance,
      and such exposure was not material at December 31, 2002.

     Fair value

     The aggregate fair value, based on market quotes, of the Company's
      third-party debt at December 31, 2002 was $11,764 million as compared with
      its carrying value of $10,988 million. The aggregate fair value of the
      Company's third-party debt at December 31, 2001 was $9,360 million as
      compared with its carrying value of $9,355 million. Based on interest
      rates available to the Company for issuances of debt with similar terms
      and remaining maturities, the aggregate fair value and carrying value of
      the Company's long-term notes payable to Altria Group, Inc. and its
      affiliates were $2,764 million and $2,560 million, respectively, at
      December 31, 2002 and $5,325 million and $5,000 million, respectively, at
      December 31, 2001.

     See Notes 3, 7 and 8 for additional disclosures of fair value for
      short-term borrowings and long-term debt.

Note 17. Contingencies:
- -----------------------

     The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal
      proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including a few
      cases in which substantial amounts of damages are sought. While the
      results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management
      believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a
      material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position
      or results of operations.

     Guarantees

     At December 31, 2002, the Company's third-party guarantees, which are
      primarily derived from acquisition and divestiture activities,
      approximated $36 million. Substantially all of these guarantees expire
      through 2012, with $12 million expiring in 2003. The Company is required
      to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third-party fails to
      make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. The Company has
      recorded a liability of $21 million at December 31, 2002 relating to these
      guarantees.
