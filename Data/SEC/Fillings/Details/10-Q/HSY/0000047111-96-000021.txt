NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial
     statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its
     subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
     transactions.  These statements reflect all adjustments which are,
     in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
     the information contained herein.  All such adjustments were of a
     normal and recurring nature.

2.   Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

                                          For the Nine Months Ended
                                     September 29, 1996  October 1, 1995
                                            (in thousands of dollars)

     Interest expense                    $41,073            $33,857      
     Interest income                      (2,944)            (2,090)     
     Capitalized interest                 (1,490)            (1,350)     
                                                                    
        Interest expense, net            $36,639            $30,417      
                                                                    


3.   In August 1996, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split
     of the Corporation's Common Stock and Class B Common Stock effective
     September 13, 1996 to stockholders of record August 23, 1996.  The
     split was effected as a stock dividend by distributing one additional
     share for each share held.  Unless otherwise indicated, all shares
     and per share information have been restated to reflect the stock
     split.

4.   Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average
     number of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
     outstanding during the period.  Average shares outstanding during the
     third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 1996 were
     153,712,298 and 154,209,159 respectively, and were 161,261,218 and
     169,346,386 for the respective periods in 1995.  There were no shares
     of Preferred Stock outstanding during the periods presented.

     A total of 8,797,770 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased
     under share repurchase programs which began in 1993.  Of the total
     shares repurchased, 528,000 shares were retired and the remainder
     were held as Treasury Stock as of September 29, 1996.  In addition,
     in August 1995, the Corporation purchased 18,099,546 shares
     (9,049,773 shares on a pre-split basis) of its Common Stock from
     Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey
     School.  A total of 26,369,316 shares were held as Treasury Stock as
     of September 29, 1996.

5.   The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out
     (LIFO) method.  The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
     first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.  Inventories were as
     follows:
                                     September 29, 1996  December 31, 1995
                                          (in thousands of dollars)

     Raw materials                       $207,641            $189,371
     Goods in process                      37,226              28,201
     Finished goods                       330,066             249,106 
                                                                     
        Inventories at FIFO               574,933             466,678

        Total inventories                $491,761            $397,570

 6.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax
     restructuring charge of $106.1 million following a comprehensive
     review of domestic and international operations designed to enhance
     performance of operating assets by lowering operating and
     administrative costs, eliminating underperforming assets and
     streamlining the overall decision-making process.  The restructuring
     program was essentially complete as of June 30, 1996.

 7.  In June 1995, the Corporation completed the sale of the outstanding
     shares of Overspecht B.V. (OZF Jamin) to a management buyout group
     at OZF Jamin, as part of the restructuring program announced by the
     Corporation in late 1994.  The Corporation purchased the outstanding
     shares of OZF Jamin in October 1993 for approximately $20.2 million.

 8.  In January 1996, the Corporation completed the sale of the assets of
     Hershey Canada, Inc.'s PLANTERS nut (Planters) and LIFE SAVERS and
     BREATH SAVERS hard candy, and BEECH-NUT cough drop (Life Savers)
     businesses to Johnvince Foods Group and Beta Brands Inc.,
     respectively.  Both transactions were part of the Corporation's
     restructuring program.

 9.  In December 1995, the Corporation completed the acquisition of the
     outstanding shares of the confectionery company Henry Heide,
     Incorporated (Henry Heide), for approximately $12.5 million.  Henry
     Heide's manufacturing facility is located in New Brunswick, N.J.,
     where it manufactures a variety of non-chocolate confectionery
     products including JUJYFRUITS candies and WUNDERBEANS jellybeans.

     The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and,
     accordingly, results subsequent to the date of acquisition are
     included in the consolidated financial statements.  Had the results
     of the Henry Heide acquisition been included in consolidated results
     for the full corresponding nine-month period of 1995, the effect
     would not have been material.

10.  In October 1995, the Corporation issued $200 million of 6.7% Notes
     due 2005 (Notes) under Form S-3 Registration Statements which were
     declared effective in June 1990 and November 1993.  The proceeds from
     issuance of the Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 8
11.  The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
     equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term
     debt approximated fair value as of September 29, 1996 and
     December 31, 1995, because of the relatively short maturity of these
     instruments.  The carrying value of long-term debt, including the
     current portion, also approximated fair value as of September 29,
     1996 and December 31, 1995, based upon quoted market prices, as of
     those dates, for the same or similar debt issues.

     As of September 29, 1996, the Corporation had foreign exchange
     forward contracts maturing in 1996 and 1997 to purchase $23.8 million
     in foreign currency, primarily British sterling and German marks, and
     to sell $28.6 million in foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars
     and Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.

     As of December 31, 1995, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
     contracts maturing in 1996 and 1997 to purchase $54.7 million in
     foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars, British sterling and
     Swiss francs, and to sell $26.4 million in foreign currency,
     primarily Italian lira, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at
     contracted forward rates.  Additionally, as of December 31, 1995, the
     Corporation had purchased foreign exchange options of $11.5 million
     and written foreign exchange options of $8.9 million, principally
     related to British sterling.  Such options expired or were settled
     in the first quarter of 1996.

     The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
     obtaining  quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted
     where necessary for maturity differences, and the fair value of
     foreign exchange options is estimated using active market quotations. 
     As of September 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995, the fair value of
     foreign exchange forward and options contracts approximated carrying
     value.  The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments
     for trading purposes.

     In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
     exposure, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements
     in the fourth quarter of 1995 to effectively convert a portion of its
     floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.  As of September 29, 1996, the
     Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional
     amount of $200.0 million with maturities through 1997.  As of
     September 29, 1996, interest rates payable were at a weighted average
     fixed rate of 5.6% and interest rates receivable were floating based
     on 30-day commercial paper composite rates.  Any interest rate
     differential on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment
     to interest expense during the period.  The Corporation's risk
     related to swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such
     agreements at current market rates.

12.  Reference is made to the Registrant's 1995 Annual Report on Form 10-K
     for more detailed financial statements and footnotes.

               Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - Third Quarter 1996 vs. Third Quarter 1995

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter rose from $981.1
million in 1995 to $1,072.3 million in 1996, an increase of 9% from
the prior year.  The higher sales primarily reflected incremental
sales from new confectionery and grocery products, confectionery
selling price increases in the United States, increased sales
volume for existing international and domestic confectionery brands
and incremental sales from the acquisition of Henry Heide.  These
increases were offset somewhat by lower sales resulting from the
divestiture of Hershey Canada Inc.'s Planters and Life Savers
businesses in January 1996.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 41.7% in 1995 to 42.7%
in 1996.  The increase was primarily the result of confectionery
price increases, increased manufacturing efficiencies and improved
profitability related to new product introductions and certain
international businesses.  These favorable variances were partially
offset by higher costs for certain major raw materials, primarily
cocoa beans and milk.  Selling, marketing and administrative
expenses increased by 10%, due to increased advertising and
promotion expenses principally associated with the introduction of
new products, offset somewhat by reduced spending for existing
brands, and higher selling expenses related primarily to
international sales volume increases.

Net interest expense in the third quarter of 1996 was in line with
the comparable period of 1995 as higher fixed interest expense was
offset by reduced short-term interest expense.  The higher fixed
interest expense related to the issuance in October 1995 of $200
million of 6.7% Notes due 2005 (Notes).  The proceeds from the
issuance of the Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings
required to fund capital additions, payment of cash dividends,
share repurchases and working capital requirements. 

The third quarter effective income tax rate increased from 38.5% in
1995 to 40.1% in 1996.  The lower rate in 1995 was due primarily to
the tax benefit associated with the partial reversal of 1994
accrued restructuring reserves related to foreign entities and the
1995 restructuring charge for a voluntary retirement program
recorded in the third quarter of last year.

Results of Operations - First Nine Months 1996 vs. First Nine
Months 1995

Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 1996 increased
by $229.4 million or 9% as a result of incremental sales from new
confectionery and grocery products, confectionery selling price
increases in the United States, increased confectionery sales
volume primarily in various international markets, and incremental
sales from the acquisition of Henry Heide.  These increases were
offset somewhat as a result of the divestitures of OZF Jamin in the
second quarter of 1995 and Hershey Canada Inc.'s Planters and Life
Savers businesses in January 1996.

The consolidated gross margin remained at 41.7% in 1995 and 1996.
Confectionery price increases, improved profitability associated
with the introduction of new products and the favorable impact of
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 10
the OZF Jamin divestiture were offset by higher costs for certain
major raw materials, primarily cocoa beans, milk, and durum
semolina and increased manufacturing costs attributable to
production start-up and manufacturing of new products, and adverse
weather conditions in the first quarter.  Selling, marketing and
administrative expenses increased by 7%, primarily due to increased
advertising and promotion expenses associated with the introduction
of new products and higher selling expenses primarily related to
international sales volume increases and new product introductions.

Net interest expense was $6.2 million above prior year, primarily
reflecting higher fixed interest expense resulting from the
issuance of $200 million of Notes in October 1995.

The effective income tax rate increased from 39.3% in 1995 to 40.1%
in 1996.  The lower rate in 1995 was due primarily to the tax
benefit associated with the reversal of 1994 accrued restructuring
reserves related to foreign entities and the 1995 restructuring
charge for a voluntary retirement program in the third quarter of
1995.

Financial Condition

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
cash generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital
needs, which typically peak during the summer, generally have been
met by issuing commercial paper.  During the first nine months of
1996, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents increased by
$27.6 million.  Cash provided from operations, the divestiture of
Hershey Canada Inc.'s Planters and Life Savers businesses and
short-term borrowings was sufficient to finance capital additions
of $108.5 million, pay cash dividends of $84.7 million and fund
share repurchases of $35.7 million.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 as of
September 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995.  The Corporation's
capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a
percent of stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was
42% as of September 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995.

In December 1995, the Corporation entered into committed credit
facility agreements with a syndicate of banks under which it could
borrow up to $600 million as of September 29, 1996, with options to
increase borrowings by $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the
banks.  Of the total committed credit facility, $200 million is for
a renewable 364-day term and $400 million is effective for a five-
year term.  The credit facilities may be used to fund general
corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and,
in certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions.  In
addition, as of September 29, 1996 and October 1, 1995, the
Corporation had lines of credit with domestic and international
commercial banks in the amount of approximately $100 million and
$1.0 billion, respectively, which could be borrowed directly or
used to support the issuance of commercial paper.

In October 1995, the Corporation issued $200 million of Notes under
Form S-3 Registration Statements which were declared effective in
June 1990 and November 1993.  As of September 29, 1996, $300
million of debt securities remained available for issuance under
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 11
the November 1993 Registration Statement.  Proceeds from any
offering of the $300 million of debt securities available under the
shelf registration may be used for general corporate requirements,
including reducing existing commercial paper borrowings, financing
capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.

In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Corporation entered into
interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of
its floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.  As of September 29,
1996, the Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate
notional amount of $200.0 million, with maturities through 1997. 
Any interest rate differential on interest rate swaps is recognized
as an adjustment to interest expense during the period.

As of September 29, 1996, the Corporation's principal capital
commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion and
modernization.  The Corporation anticipates that capital
expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $225 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of capacity
expansion to support new products and line extensions and continued
modernization of existing facilities.

Subsequent Event

In October 1996, the Corporation announced that it had reached
preliminary agreements with Huhtamaki Oy, the international foods
company based in Finland, to acquire Huhtamaki's Leaf North America
confectionery operations for a purchase price of US $440 million
plus a royalty for the license of Leaf's North American
confectionery brands from Huhtamaki.  Correspondingly, Huhtamaki
will acquire the Corporation's European confectionery interests,
the German praline manufacturer Gubor and the Italian sugar
confectionery company Sperlari, for a purchase price of US $110
million.  The transaction is expected to be completed by year-end,
subject to approval by both companies' boards and by appropriate
regulatory authorities.
