                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         The accompanying  unaudited  consolidated  financial statements include
         the accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries  after elimination
         of intercompany  accounts and transactions.  These statements have been
         prepared in accordance  with the  instructions  to Form 10-Q and do not
         include all of the  information  and  footnotes  required by  generally
         accepted accounting  principles for complete financial  statements.  In
         the opinion of management,  all adjustments  (consisting only of normal
         recurring accruals)  considered  necessary for a fair presentation have
         been included.  Certain  reclassifications have been made to prior year
         amounts to conform to the 1999 presentation.  Operating results for the
         three months and  year-to-date  ended July 4, 1999, are not necessarily
         indicative  of the  results  that may be  expected  for the year ending
         December  31, 1999.  For more  information,  refer to the  consolidated
         financial  statements and footnotes  included in the Corporation's 1998
         Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998.

4.       INVENTORIES

         (LIFO)  method.  The remaining  inventories  are stated at the lower of
         first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. Inventories were as follows:

5.       LONG-TERM DEBT

         In August 1997, the Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement
         under which it could offer,  on a delayed or  continuous  basis,  up to
         $500 million of additional  debt  securities.  As of July 4, 1999, $250
         million of debt  securities  remained  available for issuance under the
         August 1997 Registration Statement.

6.       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         The carrying amounts of financial  instruments  including cash and cash
         equivalents,  accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
         approximated  fair  value as of July 4,  1999 and  December  31,  1998,
         because of the  relatively  short  maturity of these  instruments.  The
         carrying value of long-term debt,  including the current  portion,  was
         $880.8  million as of July 4, 1999,  compared to a fair value of $903.8
         million,  based on quoted  market  prices for the same or similar  debt
         issues.

         As of July 4,  1999,  the  Corporation  had  foreign  exchange  forward
         contracts  maturing  in 1999  and 2000 to  purchase  $20.9  million  in
         foreign currency, primarily British sterling, and to sell $11.7 million
         in foreign  currency,  primarily  Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at
         contracted forward rates.

         The fair value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts is estimated by
         obtaining  quotes for future  contracts  with similar  terms,  adjusted
         where necessary for maturity differences.  As of July 4, 1999, the fair
         value of foreign exchange forward  contracts  approximated the contract
         value. The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for
         trading purposes.

         In order to minimize its  financing  costs and to manage  interest rate
         exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
         swap  agreements to effectively  convert a portion of its floating rate
         debt to fixed  rate  debt.  As of July 4,  1999,  the  Corporation  had
         agreements  outstanding  with an  aggregate  notional  amount  of $75.0
         million  maturing in 1999. As of July 4, 1999,  interest  rates payable
         were at a weighted  average fixed rate of 6.3%,  and the interest rates
         receivable were floating based on the 30-day commercial paper composite
         rate which was approximately 5.0% as of July 4, 1999. Any interest rate
         differential  on interest  rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment to
         interest  expense over the term of each agreement.  As of July 4, 1999,
         the fair  value of  interest  rate  swap  agreements  approximated  the
         contract value.  The  Corporation's  risk related to swap agreements is
         limited to the cost of replacing such  agreements at prevailing  market
         rates.

7.       DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

         In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
         of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative
         Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities  (SFAS  No.  133).  SFAS No.  133
         establishes  accounting  and reporting  standards  requiring that every
         derivative  instrument  be recorded  in the balance  sheet as either an
         asset or  liability  measured at its fair value.  SFAS No. 133 requires
         that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized  currently in
         earnings unless  specific hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Special
         accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses
         to offset related  results on the hedged item in the income  statement,
         and requires  that a company must  formally  document,  designate,  and
         assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

         The  effective  date for SFAS No. 133 has been deferred to fiscal years
         beginning  after  June  15,  2000,  but  may be  implemented  as of the
         beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance.

                                       10
<PAGE>

         Retroactive  application is not  permitted.  SFAS No. 133 must be
         applied to (a) derivative  instruments and (b) certain derivative
         instruments embedded in hybrid  contracts that were issued,  acquired,
         or  substantively  modified after December 31, 1997. Changes in
         accounting methods will be required for derivative instruments utilized
         by the  Corporation  to hedge  commodity price,  foreign  currency
         exchange  rate and  interest  rate  risks.  Such derivatives include
         commodity futures and options contracts, foreign exchange forward and
         options contracts and interest rate swaps.

         The Corporation  anticipates the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January
         1, 2001.  As of July 4, 1999,  net deferred  losses on  derivatives  of
         approximately  $33.3  million  after tax would have been  reported as a
         component of other  comprehensive  loss and  classified as  accumulated
         other  comprehensive  loss  on the  consolidated  balance  sheets  upon
         adoption of SFAS No. 133.

8.       SHARE REPURCHASES

         A total of 1,963,089  shares of Common Stock was  purchased  during the
         first quarter of 1999 under the share repurchase program begun in 1996,
         completing   the  $200  million   program.   In  February   1999,   the
         Corporation's   Board  of  Directors   approved  an  additional   share
         repurchase program  authorizing the repurchase of up to $230 million of
         the Corporation's Common Stock. Under this new program, the Corporation
         purchased  1,579,779  shares of its  Common  Stock from  Hershey  Trust
         Company,  as trustee  for the benefit of Milton  Hershey  School and an
         additional 694,811 shares through open market  transactions  during the
         first half of 1999.  As of July 4, 1999, a total of  40,443,176  shares
         were held as Treasury  Stock and $90.5 million  remained  available for
         repurchases  of Common Stock under the repurchase  program  approved in
         February.

Item 2.       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
              Financial Condition

Results of Operations - Second Quarter 1999 vs. Second Quarter 1998
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated  net sales for the second  quarter fell from $880.4 million in 1998
to $853.2  million in 1999,  a  decrease  of 3% from the prior  year.  The sales
decline resulting from the divestiture of the  Corporation's  pasta business was
partially offset by incremental sales from the introduction of new confectionery
products,  an increase in sales of core  confectionery  and grocery products and
higher  export  sales in various  international  markets.  The  increase in core
confectionery and grocery sales was partly  attributable to a controlled advance
purchase program in June intended to reduce  disruptions  during the final phase
of the implementation of an enterprise-wide information system in early July.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 40.6% in 1998 to 39.9% in 1999. The
decrease reflected lower  profitability  resulting from the mix of confectionery
items  sold in the  second  quarter  of 1999  compared  with sales in the second
quarter of 1998 and higher freight and distribution  costs. These cost increases
were offset partially by reduced costs for packaging and raw materials.

Selling,  marketing  and  administrative  expenses  decreased  by 7%,  primarily
reflecting  lower expenses  related to the  divestiture  of the pasta  business,
partially  offset by increased  marketing  expenditures  for core  confectionery
brands, international exports and the introduction of new products.

Net interest  expense in the second  quarter of 1999 was $3.7 million  below the
comparable  period of 1998,  primarily as a result of lower short-term  interest
expense as a portion of the  proceeds  from the sale of the pasta  business  was
used to reduce short-term borrowings.

The second quarter effective income tax rate was 39.0% in 1999 and 1998.

Results of Operations - First Six Months 1999 vs. First Six Months 1998
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated  net sales for the first  six  months of 1999  decreased  by $180.1
million or 9%,  primarily as a result of the  divestiture  of the  Corporation's
pasta  business  and a decrease in sales of core  confectionery  products in the
first quarter.  These sales declines were partially offset by incremental  sales
from the introduction of new confectionery  products,  increased sales resulting
from the controlled  advance purchase program in June and increased export sales
in international markets.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 40.6% in 1998 to 40.2% in 1999. The
decrease reflected lower  profitability  resulting from the mix of confectionery
items sold in 1999  compared  with sales during the  comparable  period of 1998,
primarily  related to lower sales of the more profitable  standard bars.  Higher
freight and distribution costs also contributed to the lower gross margin in the
first half of 1999.  These cost  increases  were offset  partially  by decreased
costs for  packaging  materials  and raw  materials,  a  one-time  benefit  from
revisions to the Corporation's  retiree medical plan and improved  manufacturing
efficiencies.

Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased by 9%, reflecting lower
expenses  resulting  from the  divestiture  of the pasta  business  and  reduced
marketing expenses for existing products.  These decreases were offset partially
by increased spending associated with international exports and the introduction
of new products.

Net  interest  expense was $8.0  million  below the  comparable  period of 1998,
primarily as a result of lower  short-term  interest expense as a portion of the
proceeds  from the sale of the  pasta  business  was used to  reduce  short-term
borrowings.

                                       12
<PAGE>



Excluding the provision for income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of
the pasta business, the effective income tax rate was 39.0% in 1999 and 1998.

In January  1999,  the  Corporation  recorded a gain of $243.8  million,  $165.0
million  or $1.16  per  share -  diluted  after  tax,  on the sale of its  pasta
business. Excluding the after-tax gain on the sale, net income for the first six
months of 1999 of $109.7  million  was 11%  below the  comparable  period of the
prior year and net income per share - diluted  excluding the after-tax  gain was
$.77 per share or $.08 per share below 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

Historically,  the  Corporation's  major  source  of  financing  has  been  cash
generated from  operations.  Domestic  seasonal  working  capital  needs,  which
typically peak during the summer,  generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper.  During the first six  months of 1999,  the  Corporation's  cash and cash
equivalents  decreased by $7.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents on hand at the
beginning of the period and proceeds from the  divestiture of the pasta business
were  sufficient to repay $74.1 million of short-term  debt,  repurchase  $252.0
million of the  Corporation's  Common Stock,  finance capital  expenditures  and
capitalized  software additions of $73.1 million and pay cash dividends of $66.1
million.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.7:1 as of July 4, 1999,
and 1.4:1 as of December 31, 1998. The Corporation's capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders'  equity,  short-term
and long-term debt) was 53% as of July 4, 1999, and 54% as of December 31, 1998.

As of July 4, 1999,  the  Corporation  maintained  a committed  credit  facility
agreement  with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $576.8 million which could
be borrowed  directly or used to support the issuance of commercial  paper.  The
Corporation  has the option to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with
the  concurrence  of the banks.  The  Corporation  also had lines of credit with
domestic and international commercial banks in the amount of approximately $23.0
million as of July 4, 1999 and December 31, 1998.

In March  1997,  the  Corporation  issued  $150  million of 6.95%  Notes under a
November 1993  Registration  Statement.  In August 1997, the Corporation  issued
$150 million of Notes and $250 million of Debentures under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration  Statements.  As of April 4, 1999, $250 million of debt
securities  remained  available for issuance under the August 1997  Registration
Statement.  Proceeds  from any offering of the $250  million of debt  securities
available  under  the  shelf  registration  may be used  for  general  corporate
requirements,  which include  reducing  existing  commercial  paper  borrowings,
financing  capital  additions,  and funding  future  business  acquisitions  and
working capital requirements.

As of July 4, 1999, the  Corporation's  principal capital  commitments  included
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization.  The Corporation anticipates
that capital  expenditures  will be in the range of $150 million to $170 million
per annum during the next several  years as a result of continued  modernization
of existing  facilities and capacity  expansion to support new products and line
extensions.   Such  expenditures  will  be  financed  with  cash  provided  from
operations and short-term borrowings.

Year 2000 Issues
- ----------------

Year 2000 issues associated with information systems relate to the way dates are
recorded and  computed in many  computer  systems.  These year 2000 issues could
have an impact upon the  Corporation's  information  technology  (IT) and non-IT
systems.  Non-IT systems include

                                       13
<PAGE>



embedded  technology such as  microcontrollers
which  are  integral  to  the  operation  of  most   machinery  and   equipment.
Additionally,  year 2000 issues could have a similar impact on the Corporation's
major business partners, including both customers and suppliers. While it is not
currently  possible  to  estimate  the total  impact of a failure  of either the
Corporation or its major  business  partners or suppliers to complete their year
2000  remediation in a timely manner,  the  Corporation  has determined  that it
could suffer  significant  adverse  financial  consequences  as a result of such
failure.

Awareness  and  assessment  of  year  2000  issues   regarding   major  business
applications  software and other  significant IT systems began in 1990. A formal
program to address year 2000 issues  associated  with IT systems was established
in late 1995. In early 1998, a team was established  with  representatives  from
all  major   functional   areas  of  the   Corporation   which  assumed  overall
responsibility  for ensuring that remediation of both IT and non-IT systems will
be  completed  in  time  to  prevent  material   adverse   consequences  to  the
Corporation's  business,  operations  or financial  condition.  The  Corporation
expects that  remediation of these systems will be essentially  completed during
the third quarter of 1999.

In late 1996, the Corporation approved a project to implement an enterprise-wide
integrated  information  system to improve  process  efficiencies  in all of the
major functional  areas of the Corporation,  enabling the Corporation to provide
better  service  to  its  customers.  This  system  will  replace  most  of  the
transaction systems and applications  supporting  operations of the Corporation.
In addition to improving  efficiency and customer  service,  another  benefit of
this system is that it is year 2000  compliant and will address year 2000 issues
for approximately 80% of the Corporation's business applications software. As of
July 4, 1999,  approximately $75.0 million of capitalized  software and hardware
and $8.5 million of expenses have been incurred for this project.  As of July 4,
1999, spending for implementation of this system was approximately 75% complete,
with full  implementation  expected  during  the third  quarter  of 1999.  Total
commitments  for  this  system  and  subsequently  identified  enhancements  are
expected to be  approximately  $112  million  which will be  financed  with cash
provided from operations and short-term borrowings.

The  Corporation's  mainframe,  network and desktop  hardware and software  have
recently  been  upgraded  and  are  substantially   year  2000  compliant.   The
Corporation  is in the  process  of  remediating  year  2000  compliance  issues
associated with legacy information  systems not being replaced by the integrated
information system project,  including process automation and factory management
systems.  During late 1998, the Corporation undertook an extensive review of its
year 2000 remediation  program.  As a result of this review, the Corporation has
undertaken  additional  testing  to  confirm  its year 2000  compliance,  but is
otherwise  maintaining its current  program of remediation.  As of July 4, 1999,
remediation  of both IT and  non-IT  systems  was  approximately  90%  complete,
reflecting the latest estimate of testing and work requirements to be performed.
The total cost of remediation of IT and non-IT systems not being replaced by the
integrated  information  system  project is  expected to be in the range of $6.0
million to $8.0 million.

The Corporation is also in the process of assessing year 2000 remediation issues
relating  to  its  major  business  partners.  All of  the  Corporation's  major
customers have been  contacted  regarding year 2000 issues related to electronic
data interchange. The Corporation is also in the process of contacting its major
suppliers  of  ingredients,   packaging,  facilities,  logistics  and  financial
services  with  regard  to  year  2000  issues.  Because  of  the  uncertainties
associated with assessing the ability of major business partners to complete the
remediation of their systems in time to prevent  operational  difficulties,  the
Corporation  will continue to contact and/or visit major customers and suppliers
to gain assurances that no significant  adverse  consequences will result due to
their failure to complete remediation of their systems.

Year 2000 remediation,  conversion,  validation and implementation is continuing
and,  at  the  present  time,  it is  expected  that  remediation  to  both  the
Corporation's IT and non-IT systems and

                                       14
<PAGE>


those of major business  partners will be completed in time to prevent  material
adverse  consequences  to the  Corporation's  business,  operations or financial
condition.  However,  contingency plans are being developed,  including possible
increases  in  raw  material  and  finished  goods  inventory  levels,  and  the
identification   of  alternate   vendors  and  suppliers.   The  Corporation  is
participating in industry-wide  efforts to develop  contingency  plans which, to
the extent  feasible,  may be relied  upon to  resolve  any  potential  failures
resulting from year 2000 issues.  Operational and incident specific  contingency
plans are being developed within the context of an overall  business  continuity
contingency plan for all major functional areas of the Corporation.


Subsequent Events
- -----------------

In early July, the Corporation implemented the final phase of an enterprise-wide
integrated   information  system.  This  implementation   includes   substantial
revisions to the order taking and distribution  administrative  processes which,
if problems occur, could adversely impact sales and earnings for future periods.
While the Corporation is experiencing some start-up difficulties,  it is not yet
possible to determine what impact, if any, they will have on financial results.

Also in July, the  Corporation  entered into an operating lease agreement for an
amount not to exceed $65 million for the purpose of financing construction costs
of  a  warehouse  and  distribution  facility  located  on  land  owned  by  the
Corporation near Hershey, Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor pays for
the  construction  costs and thereafter  leases the facility to the Corporation.
The lease term is six  years.  The lease  provides  for a  substantial  residual
guarantee and includes an option to purchase the facility at original  cost. The
first  phase of the  distribution  center  is  scheduled  to open in the  second
quarter of 2000.

Forward Looking Information
- ---------------------------

The  nature of the  Corporation's  operations  and the  environment  in which it
operates  subject  it  to  changing   economic,   competitive,   regulatory  and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties.  In connection with the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the
Corporation notes the following factors which, among others,  could cause future
results to differ materially from the forward-looking  statements,  expectations
and  assumptions  expressed  or  implied  herein.  Many of the  forward  looking
statements  contained  in  this  document  may  be  identified  by  the  use  of
forward-looking  words  such as  "believe,"  "expect,"  "anticipate,"  "should,"
"planned,"  "estimated," and "potential" among others. Factors which could cause
results to differ include,  but are not limited to: changes in the confectionery
and grocery business  environment,  including actions of competitors and changes
in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws and regulations, including
income  taxes;  market  demand for new and existing  products;  and raw material
pricing.


Item 3.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

The  potential  loss in fair value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  and
interest rate swaps  resulting from a hypothetical  near-term  adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not material as of July 4, 1999. The market risk
resulting  from a  hypothetical  adverse  market  price  movement of ten percent
associated  with the  estimated  average fair value of net  commodity  positions
increased from $7.6 million as of December 31, 1998, to $11.7 million as of July
4, 1999.  Market risk represents 10% of the estimated  average fair value of net
commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period.

                          PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Items 2 through 4 have been omitted as not applicable.


Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

In  January  1999,  the  Corporation  received a Notice of  Proposed  Deficiency
(Notice)  from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  related to the years 1989
through 1996. The most  significant  issue pertains to the Corporate  Owned Life
Insurance  (COLI) program which was  implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The
IRS proposed the disallowance of interest expense deductions associated with the
underlying life insurance policies.  The Corporation  believes that it has fully
complied  with the tax law as it relates to its COLI  program.  The  Corporation
filed a protest of the proposed  deficiency  with the Appeals section of the IRS
in April 1999 and intends to vigorously defend its position on this matter.

In June 1999, the Pennsylvania  Supreme Court determined that the  manufacturing
exemption for Capital Stock - Franchise Tax purposes is facially  discriminatory
under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution,  and remanded for a
determination  whether the tax on foreign  corporations is a valid  compensatory
tax.  The court  further  suggested  that the  result  might be that the  entire
exemption  would  be ruled  unconstitutional.  If such a  ruling  is  eventually
sustained,  the  Corporation  may be subject to  additional  Pennsylvania  state
income tax liability.

The  Corporation  has no other material  pending legal  proceedings,  other than
ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.


Item 5.  Other Information

In early July, the Corporation implemented the final phase of an enterprise-wide
integrated   information  system.  This  implementation   includes   substantial

While the Corporation is experiencing some start-up difficulties,  it is not yet
possible to determine what impact, if any, they will have on financial results.

Also in July, the  Corporation  entered into an operating lease agreement for an
