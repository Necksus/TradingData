NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements
    include the accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after
    elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.  These statements
    reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,
    necessary for a fair presentation of the information contained herein. 
    All such adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

2.  Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

                                           For the Nine Months Ended
                                      October 2, 1994    October 3, 1993  
                                           (in thousands of dollars)

    Interest expense                     $ 30,019            $ 26,105 
    Interest income                        (1,154)             (2,593)
    Capitalized interest                   (2,527)             (3,414)
                                                                      
       Interest expense, net             $ 26,338            $ 20,098 
                                                                      

3.  Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average number
    of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock outstanding
    during the period.  Average shares outstanding during the third quarter
    and nine months ended October 2, 1994 were 86,807,945 and 87,108,115,
    respectively, and were 90,124,472 and 90,165,939, respectively, for the
    comparable periods of 1993.  There were no shares of Preferred Stock
    outstanding during the periods presented.

    During the second quarter of 1993, the Corporation's Board of Directors
    approved a share repurchase program to acquire from time to time through
    open market or privately negotiated transactions up to $200 million of
    Common Stock.  A total of 3,431,539 shares have been repurchased under
    the program of which 3,167,539 shares were held as Treasury Stock as of
    October 2, 1994.

4.  The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out
    (LIFO) method.  The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
    first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.  Inventories were as follows:

                                      October 2, 1994    December 31, 1993
                                            (in thousands of dollars)

    Raw materials                         $295,038            $209,570
    Goods in process                        33,529              37,261
    Finished goods                         305,683             265,616

       Total inventories                  $581,738            $453,442 
                                                                      








 5. In March 1993, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of $80.6 million
    on the sale of its 18.6% interest in Freia Marabou a.s.  This gain had
    the effect of increasing net income in the first quarter of 1993 by
    $40.6 million.  Gross proceeds received from the sale were $259.7 million.

 6. In March 1993, the Corporation purchased certain assets of the Cleveland
    area Ideal Macaroni and Mrs. Weiss Noodle companies for approximately
    $14.6 million.

    In September 1993, the Corporation completed the acquisition of the
    Italian confectionery business of Heinz Italia S.p.A. for approximately
    $130.0 million.  The business is the leader in the Italian non-chocolate
    confectionery market and manufactures and distributes a wide range of
    confectionery products, including sugar candies and traditional products
    for special occasions such as nougat and gift boxes.
      
    In October 1993, the Corporation completed the purchase of the
    outstanding shares of Overspecht B.V. (OZF Jamin) for approximately
    $20.2 million plus the assumption of approximately $13.4 million in
    debt.  OZF Jamin manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery
    products, cookies, biscuits and ice cream for distribution primarily to
    customers in the Netherlands and Belgium.

    In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase
    prices for the above acquisitions have been allocated to the underlying
    assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition based on their
    estimated respective fair values.  These allocations and estimated fair
    values may be revised at a later date.  Results subsequent to the dates
    of acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements. 
    Had the results of the acquisitions been included in consolidated
    financial results for each period presented, the effect would not have
    been material.

 7. During the first half of 1993, the Corporation completed the early
    repayment of $95.2 million of long-term debt.

 8. Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statements of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Post-
    retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and No. 109 "Accounting for
    Income Taxes" by means of catch-up adjustments.  The net charge
    associated with these changes in accounting had the effect of decreasing
    net income by approximately $103.9 million, or $1.15 per share.

                      Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - Third Quarter 1994 vs. Third Quarter 1993

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter rose from $935.7 million in 1993
to $966.5 million in 1994, an increase of 3%.  The increase was mainly
attributable to international businesses acquired in late 1993, new
confectionery products, and price increases on pasta products.  Sales of
existing confectionery brands were comparable to those achieved in the third
quarter of 1993 which had the benefit of strong sales gains as a result of
the HERSHEY'S HUGS chocolates and HERSHEY'S HUGS WITH ALMONDS chocolates
introductions.  

The consolidated gross margin increased slightly from 41.8% in 1993 to 41.9%
in 1994.  The increase reflected manufacturing efficiencies and pasta selling
price increases, largely offset by generally lower margins associated with
the recently acquired international businesses, higher depreciation expenses,
and increased costs for certain major raw materials, particularly semolina.
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million or 1%
primarily as a result of expenses associated with 1993 business acquisitions,
offset substantially by lower advertising expenses associated with existing
confectionery brands.  

Net interest expense increased by $4.0 million in the third quarter of 1994
compared with 1993, primarily as a result of higher short-term interest
expense and lower capitalized interest, slightly offset by lower fixed
interest expense.  The 1994 increase in short-term interest expense reflected
higher average short-term borrowing levels to finance acquisitions and the
share repurchase program, and increased short-term borrowing rates.  Fixed
interest expense was less than prior year due to lower long-term borrowing
balances and capitalized interest was below prior year primarily as a result
of the completion of various long-term construction projects in the first
half of 1994. 

The third quarter effective income tax rate decreased from 41.9% in 1993 to
39.8% in 1994.  The higher 1993 effective income tax rate primarily reflected
the impact of the retroactive increase in the Federal statutory income tax
rate enacted as part of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 recorded in
the third quarter of 1993.  The effective income tax rate in 1994 also
reflected the favorable impact of changes in the mix of the Corporation's
income among various tax jurisdictions.

Results of Operations - First Nine Months 1994 vs. First Nine Months 1993

Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 1994 increased by $74.5
million or 3%, primarily as a result of new confectionery products,
international businesses acquired in late 1993 and pasta price increases. 
These increases were significantly offset by lower sales for existing
confectionery and grocery brands caused by weak market conditions which began
late in the first quarter of 1993 and continued into the first half of 1994,
adverse weather and an earlier Easter in 1994, and the timing of certain
year-end promotions which shifted some domestic confectionery sales into the
fourth quarter of 1993.







The consolidated gross margin decreased from 42.1% in 1993 to 41.0% in 1994. 
The decrease was primarily the result of higher costs for certain major raw
materials, particularly semolina, lower margins associated with the
international businesses acquired in late 1993, and higher expenses for
depreciation and shipping, partially offset by lower costs resulting from
manufacturing efficiency improvements, and pasta selling price increases. 
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased by $7.3 million or
1%, primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses associated 



<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 9

with the 1993 business acquisitions and increased advertising and promotion
expenses related to the introduction of new products.  These increases were
substantially offset by reduced levels of advertising and promotions for
existing confectionery brands.

In March 1993, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of $80.6 million on
the sale of its 18.6% investment interest in Freia Marabou a.s (Freia) which
increased net income by $40.6 million.

Net interest expense was $6.2 million above prior year as higher short-term
interest expense and reduced interest income and capitalized interest were
only partially offset by lower fixed interest expense.  Short-term interest
expense was above prior year as a result of increased borrowings to finance
1993 acquisitions and the share repurchase program, and increased short-term
borrowing rates.  Fixed interest expense was less than prior year due to the
retirement of long-term debt in 1993 and capitalized interest was below prior
year reflecting the completion of significant long-term construction
projects.  Investment income was below prior year due to lower investment
balances slightly offset by an increase in average investment income rates.

The effective income tax rate decreased from 42.6% in 1993 to 39.8% in 1994. 
The higher rate in 1993 was due primarily to the relatively high income taxes
associated with the gain on the sale of the Freia investment.  The lower
effective income tax rate in 1994 reflected the impact of changes in the mix
of the Corporation's income among various tax jurisdictions.
 
Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" and No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" by
means of catch-up adjustments.  The net charge associated with these changes
in accounting had the effect of decreasing 1993 net income for the first nine
months by approximately $103.9 million, or $1.15 per share.


Financial Condition

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing
commercial paper.  During the first nine months of 1994, the Corporation's
cash and cash equivalents increased by $18.7 million.  Cash provided from
operations and short-term borrowings were sufficient to finance capital
additions of $109.2 million, pay cash dividends of $79.2 million, fund share
repurchases of $38.8 million and repay $14.1 million of long-term debt.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 as of October 2,
1994 and December 31, 1993.  The Corporation's capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders' equity, short-
term and long-term debt) was 32% as of October 2, 1994, and 27% as of
December 31, 1993.  The increase primarily reflects higher levels of short-
term borrowings to finance seasonal working capital needs and the share
repurchase program.  As of October 2, 1994, the Corporation had $34.7 million
of cash and cash equivalents, $6.7 million of current portion of long-term
debt and $526.0 million of short-term debt.  Additionally, the Corporation
had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks in the
amount of approximately $725 million which could be borrowed directly or used
to support the issuance of commercial paper.  




As of October 2, 1994, $100 million of debt securities remained available for
issuance under a Form S-3 Registration Statement which was declared effective
in June 1990 and an additional $400 million of debt securities under a Form
S-3 Registration Statement declared effective in November 1993.  Proceeds 



<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 10

from any offering of the $500 million of debt securities available under
these shelf registrations may be used to reduce existing commercial paper
borrowings, finance capital additions, and fund the share repurchase program
and future business acquisitions.

As of October 2, 1994, the Corporation's principal capital commitments
included manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization.  The Corporation
anticipates that capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 to $200
million per annum during the next several years as a result of the expansion
of facilities to support new products and continued modernization of existing
facilities.  

During the second quarter of 1993, the Corporation's Board of Directors
approved a share repurchase program to acquire from time to time through open
market or privately negotiated transactions up to $200 million of Common
Stock.  A total of 3,431,539 shares have been repurchased under the program
of which 3,167,539 shares were held as Treasury Stock as of October 2, 1994.

Subsequent Event

In November 1994, the Corporation announced that it will take a restructuring
charge in the fourth quarter.  The restructuring plan will be implemented
over the next 12 to 15 months and will result in a fourth quarter charge of
approximately $120 million to $130 million before tax.  This equates to an
after-tax charge of $97 million to $105 million, or $1.12 to $1.21 per share
in 1994.  Annual pre-tax savings of approximately $15 million to $20 million
are expected starting in 1996.

The charge is the result of a comprehensive review of domestic and
international operations designed to enhance performance of operating assets
by lowering operating and administrative costs, eliminating underperforming
assets and streamlining the overall decision-making process.  The
restructuring will include corporate-wide overhead reductions, disposal of
underperforming assets and a realignment of chocolate and confectionery
manufacturing operations in North America.  As a result of the restructuring,
approximately 400 positions are being eliminated in the manufacturing,
technical and administrative areas.  The Corporation is providing appropriate
severance and benefit packages, as well as outplacement assistance.

                    Hershey Foods Takes Restructuring Charge


HERSHEY, Pa. - Hershey Foods Corporation announced today that it will take a
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 1994.  The charge is the result
of a comprehensive review of domestic and international operations designed
to enhance performance of operating assets by lowering operating and
administrative costs, eliminating underperforming assets and streamlining the
overall decision-making process.  The restructuring will include corporate-
wide overhead reductions, disposal of underperforming assets and a
realignment of chocolate and confectionery manufacturing operations in North
America.  As a result of the restructuring, approximately 400 positions are
being eliminated in the manufacturing, technical and administrative areas. 
The Corporation is providing appropriate severance and benefit packages, as
well as outplacement assistance.

The restructuring plan will be implemented over the next 12 to 15 months and
will result in a fourth quarter charge of approximately $120 million to $130
million before tax.  This equates to an after-tax charge of $97 million to
$105 million, or $1.12 to $1.21 per share in 1994.  Annual pre-tax savings of
approximately $15 million to $20 million are expected starting in 1996.

"As we assess the constantly changing market environment, we have adjusted
our strategic plan to emphasize that our mission is to be a focused food
company in North America and selected international markets," said Kenneth L.
Wolfe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "In view of NAFTA, our strategy
in North America is to enhance our number one position in chocolate and
confectionery.  For this reason we are realigning our North American
chocolate and confectionery operations (U.S.A., Canada, and Mexico) into a
consolidated unit to be called Hershey Chocolate North America.  In doing so,
we hope to capitalize on Hershey Chocolate U.S.A.'s strengths to improve our
competitive positions in the Canadian and Mexican markets and enhance our
overall returns.  As announced previously, Hershey Chocolate North America
will be under the leadership of Michael F. Pasquale, currently President of
Hershey Chocolate U.S.A., and remain headquartered in Hershey, PA.

"At the same time, we have reassessed our overall approach to international
investments and are focusing our attention on markets where we can gain
important market positions while generating returns more in line with our
other operations.  In addition, all activities within the Corporation have
been examined to ensure the most productive use of our assets.  The
restructuring charge encompasses the major impact of this program, however,
continuous productivity improvement is an ongoing objective.

"This program is being undertaken at a time when our financial picture is
strong and our business is on track to record another fine year.  It is our
belief that these steps will improve our ability to provide consumers with
quality products at the lowest possible cost," Wolfe concluded.

Hershey Foods Corporation, which is celebrating its centennial in 1994, is a
leading North American producer of chocolate and confectionery products, a
major U.S. producer of dry pasta products, and has international interests in
Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium, and the Far East.
