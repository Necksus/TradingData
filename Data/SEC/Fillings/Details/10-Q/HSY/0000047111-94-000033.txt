NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements 
     include the accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after 
     elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.  These statements 
     reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary 
     for a fair presentation of the information contained herein.  All such
     adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

2.   Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

                                             For the Six Months Ended
                                        July 3, 1994           July 4, 1993 
                                            (in thousands of dollars)

        Interest expense                   $ 18,848              $ 18,257  
        Interest income                        (851)               (2,036)   
        Capitalized interest                 (1,968)               (2,468)   
                                                                                
           Interest expense, net           $ 16,029              $ 13,753  
                                                                                

3.   Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average number 
     of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock outstanding 
     during the period.  Average shares outstanding during the second quarter 
     and six months ended July 3, 1994 were 87,095,985 and 87,256,569, 
     respectively, and were 90,186,336 for all periods in 1993.  There were no 
     shares of Preferred Stock outstanding during the periods presented.

     During the second quarter of 1993, the Corporation's Board of Directors 
     approved a share repurchase program to acquire from time to time through 
     open market or privately negotiated transactions up to $200 million of 
     Common Stock.  A total of 3,254,639 shares have been repurchased under 
     the program of which 2,990,639 shares were held as Treasury Stock as of 
     July 3, 1994.

4.   The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) 
     method.  The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, 
     first-out (FIFO) cost or market. Inventories were as follows:

                                         July 3, 1994      December 31, 1993
                                              (in thousands of dollars)

        Raw materials                        $337,000           $209,570
        Goods in process                       39,647             37,261
        Finished goods                        310,672            265,616

            Total inventories                $615,652           $453,442 
                                                                    

 5.  In March 1993, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of $80.6 million 
     on the sale of its 18.6% interest in Freia Marabou a.s.  This gain had 
     the effect of increasing net income in the first quarter of 1993 by 
     $40.6 million.  Gross proceeds received from the sale were $259.7 
     million.

6.   In March 1993, the Corporation purchased certain assets of the Cleveland 
     area Ideal Macaroni and Mrs. Weiss Noodle companies for approximately 
     $14.6 million.

     In September 1993, the Corporation completed the acquisition of the 
     Italian confectionery business of Heinz Italia S.p.A. for approximately 
     $130.0 million.  The business is the leader in the Italian non-chocolate 
     confectionery market and manufactures and distributes a wide range of 
     confectionery products, including sugar candies and traditional products 
     for special occasions such as nougat and gift boxes.
      
     In October 1993, the Corporation completed the purchase of the outstanding 
     shares of Overspecht B.V. (OZF Jamin) for approximately $20.2 million plus 
     the assumption of approximately $13.4 million in debt.  OZF Jamin 
     manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products, cookies,
     biscuits and ice cream for distribution primarily to customers in the 
     Netherlands and Belgium.

     In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase prices 
     for the above acquisitions have been allocated to the underlying assets 
     and liabilities at the date of acquisition based on their estimated 
     respective fair values.  These allocations and estimated fair values may 
     be revised at a later date.  Results subsequent to the dates of 
     acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements.  Had
     the results of the acquisitions been included in consolidated financial 
     results for each period presented, the effect would not have been material.

 7.  During the first half of 1993, the Corporation completed the early 
     repayment of $95.2 million of long-term debt.

 8.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statements of Financial 
     Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement 
     Benefits Other Than Pensions" and No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" 
     by means of catch-up adjustments.  The net charge associated with these 
     changes in accounting had the effect of decreasing net income by
     approximately $103.9 million, or $1.15 per share.

 9.  Reference is made to the Registrant's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
     more detailed financial statements and footnotes.

                Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - Second Quarter 1994 vs. Second Quarter 1993


Consolidated net sales for the second quarter rose from $618.4 million in 1993 
to $676.0 million in 1994, an increase of 9%.  The increase was mainly 
attributable to new confectionery products, international businesses acquired 
in the second half of 1993 and price increases on pasta products.  Sales of 
existing confectionery and grocery brands were approximately even with those 
achieved during the comparable 1993 period.  

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.2% in 1993 to 40.4% in 1994.  
The decrease was primarily the result of higher costs for certain major raw 
materials, particularly semolina, the generally lower margins associated with 
the recently acquired international businesses and higher depreciation 
expenses, partially offset by pasta selling price increases.  Selling, 
marketing and administrative expenses increased $16.5 million or 8% due to
expenses associated with 1993 business acquisitions and promotion expenses 
related to new product introductions.  

Net interest expense increased by $2.3 million in the second quarter of 1994 
compared with 1993, primarily as a result of higher short-term interest 
expense and lower interest income, partially offset by lower fixed interest 
expense.  The 1994 increase in short-term interest expense reflected higher 
average short-term borrowing levels to finance 1993 acquisitions and the 
share repurchase program.  Fixed interest expense was less than prior year 
due to the retirement of debt in 1993 and investment income was below prior
year due to lower investment balances. 

The second quarter effective income tax rate increased from 39.3% in 1993 to 
39.8% in 1994.  The higher rate in 1994 reflected the increase in the Federal 
statutory income tax rate as provided for in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 
1993, partially offset by changes in the mix of the Corporation's income among 
various tax jurisdictions.



Results of Operations - First Six Months 1994 vs. First Six Months 1993


Consolidated net sales for the first six months of 1994 increased by $43.7 
million or 3%, primarily as a result of new confectionery products, 
international businesses acquired in the second half of 1993 and pasta price 
increases.  These increases were significantly offset by lower sales for 
existing confectionery and grocery brands caused by weak market conditions 
which began late in the first quarter of 1993 and continued into the first half 
of 1994, adverse weather and an earlier Easter in 1994, and the timing of 
certain year-end promotions which shifted some domestic confectionery sales
into the fourth quarter of 1993.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 42.3% in 1993 to 40.4% in 1994.  
The decrease was primarily the result of higher costs for certain major raw 
materials, including semolina, lower margins associated with the recently 
acquired international businesses, and higher expenses for depreciation and 
shipping, partially offset by pasta selling price increases.  Selling, 
marketing and administrative expenses increased by 1%, primarily due to higher
selling and administrative expenses associated with the 1993 business 
acquisitions and promotion expenses related to the introduction of new 
products.  These increases were substantially offset by reduced levels of 
promotions and advertising for existing confectionery brands.

In March 1993, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of $80.6 million on the 
sale of its 18.6% investment interest in Freia Marabou a.s (Freia) which 
increased net income by $40.6 million.


<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 9

Net interest expense was $2.3 million above prior year as higher short-term 
interest expense and reduced interest income and capitalized interest were 
only partially offset by lower fixed interest expense.  Short-term interest 
expense was above prior year as a result of increased borrowings to finance 
1993 acquisitions and the share repurchase program.  Fixed interest expense 
was less than prior year due to the retirement of long-term debt in 1993 and
capitalized interest was below prior year reflecting the completion of 
significant long-term construction projects.  Investment income was below 
prior year due to lower investment balances slightly offset by an increase 
in average investment income rates.


The effective income tax rate decreased from 42.9% in 1993 to 39.8% in 1994.  
The higher rate in 1993 was due primarily to the relatively high income taxes 
associated with the gain on the sale of the Freia investment.  The 1994 
effective income tax rate reflected the increase in the Federal statutory 
income tax rate as provided for in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993.
 

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statements of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions" and No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" by 
means of catch-up adjustments.  The net charge associated with these changes 
in accounting had the effect of decreasing 1993 net income for the first six 
months by approximately $103.9 million, or $1.15 per share.


Financial Condition


Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash 
generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which 
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing 
commercial paper.  During the first six months of 1994, the Corporation's 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by $.3 million.  Cash provided from 
operations and short-term borrowings were largely sufficient to finance 
capital additions of $79.4 million, pay cash dividends of $51.5 million and 
fund share repurchases of $31.3 million.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 as of July 3, 1994 
and December 31, 1993.  The Corporation's capitalization ratio (total short-
term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders' equity, short-term 
and long-term debt) was 32% as of July 3, 1994, and 27% as of 
December 31, 1993. The increase primarily reflects higher levels of short-
term borrowings to finance seasonal working capital needs and the share 
repurchase program.  As of July 3, 1994, the Corporation had $15.7 million of
cash and cash equivalents, $18.4 million of current portion of long-term debt
and $485.3 million of short-term debt.  Additionally, the Corporation had lines
of credit with domestic and international commercial banks in the amount of
approximately $600 million which could be borrowed directly or used to support
the issuance of commercial paper.  

As of July 3, 1994, $100 million of debt securities remained available for 
issuance under a Form S-3 Registration Statement which was declared effective 
in June 1990 and an additional $400 million of debt securities under a Form S-3 
Registration Statement declared effective in November 1993.  Proceeds from any 
offering of the $500 million of debt securities available under these shelf
registrations may be used to reduce existing commercial paper borrowings, 
finance capital additions, and fund the share repurchase program and future 
business acquisitions.

As of July 3, 1994, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included 
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization.  The Corporation 
anticipates that capital expenditures will be in the range of $150 to $200 
million per annum during the next several years as a result of the expansion 
of facilities to support new products and continued modernization of existing 
facilities.

During the second quarter of 1993, the Corporation's Board of Directors 
approved a share repurchase program to acquire from time to time through open
market or privately negotiated transactions up to $200 million of Common 
Stock.  A total of 3,254,639 shares have been repurchased under the program 
of which 2,990,639 shares were held as Treasury Stock as of July 3, 1994.
