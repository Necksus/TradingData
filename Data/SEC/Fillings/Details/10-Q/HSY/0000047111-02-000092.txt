The  accompanying   unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the
accounts   of   Hershey   Foods    Corporation   and   its   subsidiaries   (the
&#147;Corporation&#148;)   after   elimination  of  intercompany   accounts  and
transactions.  These  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with the
instructions  to  Form  10-Q  and do not  include  all  of the  information  and
footnotes  required by accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United
States for complete  financial  statements.  In the opinion of  management,  all
adjustments  (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the six months
ended June 30, 2002, are not  necessarily  indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2002,  because of the seasonal effects
of  the  Corporation&#146;s  business.  For  more  information,   refer  to  the
consolidated  financial statements and notes included in the  Corporation&#146;s
2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K.<BR><BR>

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the
2002 presentation.  In accordance with final consensuses reached on various EITF
Issues regarding the reporting of certain sales incentives, costs totaling $82.2
million  and $174.9  million for the three  months and six months  ended July 1,
2001, respectively, previously reported in selling, marketing and administrative
expense,  have been  reclassified  as a  reduction  to net sales.  In  addition,
certain  freight  billings  totaling  $.6 million and $1.1 million for the three
months and six months ended July 1, 2001,  respectively,  previously reported in
cost of sales have been reclassified as an increase to net sales.<BR><BR>

<B><LI> BUSINESS REALIGNMENT INITIATIVES</B>
<BR><BR>
In late October 2001, the Corporation&#146;s  Board of Directors approved a plan
to  improve  the  efficiency  and   profitability   of  the   Corporation&#146;s
operations.  The plan  included  asset  management  improvements,  product  line
rationalization,  supply chain  efficiency  improvements,  and a voluntary  work
force  reduction   program   (collectively,   &#147;the   business   realignment
initiatives&#148;).  The major  components  of the plan will be completed by the
fourth  quarter  of  2002.  For more  information  on the  business  realignment
initiatives  recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001,  refer to the  consolidated
financial  statements and notes included in the  Corporation&#146;s  2001 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.<BR><BR>

During  the  first  quarter  of 2002,  a charge  to cost of sales  and  business
realignment charges were recorded totaling $9.0 million before tax ($5.7 million
after-tax  or $.04 per  share-diluted).  The total  included a charge to cost of
sales of $.2 million  associated with the relocation of manufacturing  equipment
and a  business  realignment  charge  of $8.8  million.  Components  of the $8.8
million pre-tax charge for these  initiatives  included $.1 million  relating to
product line  rationalization,  $.1 million  relating to supply chain efficiency
improvements,  and $8.6 million relating to pension  settlement costs associated
with the voluntary work force reduction program (&#147;VWRP&#148;).<BR><BR>

During the second  quarter of 2002,  a charge to cost of sales and net  business
realignment charges were recorded totaling $2.5 million before tax ($1.6 million
after-tax  or $.01 per  share-diluted).  The total  included a charge to cost of
sales of $.5 million  associated with the relocation of manufacturing  equipment
and a net business  realignment  charge of $2.0  million.  Components of the net
$2.0 million pre-tax charge for these initiatives included a $6.4 million charge
relating to pension settlement costs associated with the VWRP,  partially offset
by a $4.4  million  favorable  adjustment  relating  to the  sale of a group  of
Hershey&#146;s  non-chocolate  confectionery  candy brands to Farley&#146;s  and
Sathers Candy Company, Inc. (the &#147;Farley&#146;s and Sathers sale&#148;) for
$12.0 million in cash.  Additional charges totaling  approximately $23.8 million
before tax, or $.11 per share-diluted, are expected to be recorded, as incurred,
by the end of 2002,  primarily  related to additional  pension  settlement costs
resulting  from  the  VWRP  and  expenses  associated  with  the  relocation  of
manufacturing equipment.<BR><BR>

initiatives.<BR><BR>

During the second  quarter of 2002,  cash  payments  totaling  $1.4  million for
equipment removal relating to outsourcing the manufacture of certain ingredients
were    recorded    against   the    liability    for    business    realignment

realignment  initiatives.  In addition, a net pre-tax charge of $8.6 million was
credited  to  pension  benefit  liabilities  during  the first  quarter  of 2002
relating  to  pension  settlement  costs  associated  with  departing  employees
electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefit under the early  retirement

lives of  intangible  assets  acquired on or before June 30, 2001 was  completed
during the first  quarter  of 2002.  Amortization  of  goodwill  resulting  from
business  acquisitions of $388.7 million was discontinued as of January 1, 2002.
Other  intangible  assets totaling $40.4 million as of January 1, 2002 primarily
consisted of trademarks and patents obtained through business acquisitions.  The
useful lives of trademarks  were  determined to be  indefinite  and,  therefore,
amortization  of these assets was  discontinued  as of January 1, 2002.  Patents
valued at a total of $9.0 million are being amortized over their remaining legal
lives of approximately eighteen years.</font></p>

Reclassification  adjustments from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income to
income, for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives,  were reflected in
cost of sales. Pre-tax gains on cash flow hedging derivatives recognized in cost
of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately $.6 million and
$1.1  million  for the  three  months  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2002,
respectively.  Pre-tax net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives recognized in
cost of sales  as a  result  of hedge  ineffectiveness  were  approximately  $.9
million and $.2 million for the three  months and six months ended July 1, 2001,
respectively.  No  gains  or  losses  on  cash  flow  hedging  derivatives  were
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income as a
result of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged
forecasted  transaction  would not occur.  There were no  components of gains or
losses on cash flow hedging  derivatives  that were recognized in income because
such    components    were    excluded    from   the    assessment    of   hedge
effectiveness.<BR><BR>

The

As
of June 30, 2002, the amount of net after-tax gains on cash flow hedging
derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap
agreements and commodities futures contracts, expected to be reclassified into
earnings in the next twelve months were approximately $20.3 million, compared to
net after-tax losses on cash flow hedging derivatives to be reclassified into
earnings in the next twelve months of $15.1 million as of July 1, 2001.<BR><BR>

The
increase in raw material inventories as of June 30, 2002 reflected the seasonal
timing of deliveries to support manufacturing requirements. Raw material
inventories were $240.1 million as of June 30, 2002 compared to $318.0 million
as of July 1, 2001.<BR><BR>


<B><LI>   LONG-TERM DEBT</B>
<BR><BR>
In
August 1997, the Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement under which
it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $500 million of
additional debt securities. As of June 30, 2002, $250 million of debt securities
remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration Statement.<BR><BR>


<B><LI>  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</B>
<br><br>
The
carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximated fair
value as of June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, because of the relatively short
maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt, including
the current portion, was

<p align=center><font size=2>-11-</font></p>
<hr size=2 noshade>
<BR><BR>
$869.0 million as of June 30, 2002, compared to a fair
value of $949.7 million, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar
debt issues.<BR><BR>

As
of June 30, 2002, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward contracts
maturing in 2002 and 2003 to purchase $40.0 million in foreign currency,
primarily British sterling, and to sell $21.8 million in foreign currency,
primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.<BR><BR>

The
fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by obtaining
quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for
maturity differences. As of June 30, 2002, the fair value of foreign exchange
forward contracts approximated the contract value. The Corporation does not hold
or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.<BR><BR>

In
order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, the
Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. In
February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements that
effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental payments on certain
operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%. Any interest rate
differential on interest rate swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to
interest expense over the term of each agreement. The fair value of interest
rate swap agreements was a liability of $4.1 million and $2.7 million as of
June&#160;30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. The Corporation&#146;s
risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of
replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates.<BR><BR>


<B><LI>  SHARE REPURCHASES</B>
<BR><BR>
In
October 1999, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors approved a share
repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of the
Corporation&#146;s Common Stock. Under this program, a total of 2,388,586 shares
of Common Stock was purchased through June 30, 2002. As of June 30, 2002, a
total of 43,325,880 shares were held as Treasury Stock and $84.2 million
remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under the repurchase program</font>.

<p><B>Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition</B></P>

<B><U>Results of Operations - Second Quarter 2002 vs. Second Quarter 2001</U></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Consolidated net sales for
the second quarter increased from $817.3 million in 2001 to $823.5 million in
2002. The increase over the prior year primarily reflected higher sales
resulting from: increases in sales of key confectionery brands in the United
States, including new products and line extensions, and selected confectionery
selling price increases. These increases were substantially offset by lower
sales resulting from higher returns, discounts and allowances, and the
rationalization of certain under-performing brands, including the discontinuance
of the Corporation&#146;s aseptically packaged drink products in the United
States and the divestiture of the <I>Luden&#146;s</I> throat drop business in
September 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The consolidated gross
margin increased from 36.7% in 2001 to 38.1% in 2002. The increase reflected
decreased costs for certain major raw materials, primarily milk and peanuts, a
more profitable sales mix and selected confectionery selling price increases.
The impact of these items was partially offset by higher returns, discounts, and
allowances, which were higher as a percentage of sales compared to the prior
year. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased by 2% in 2002,
primarily reflecting the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002. Excluding
the impact of goodwill amortization in 2001, selling, marketing and
administrative expenses in 2002 were flat compared to 2001. Lower salary expense
associated with reduced staffing resulting from the Corporation&#146;s early
retirement program was offset by the cost of studies related to developing
marketing strategies and cost efficiencies and expenses resulting from the work
stoppage of union employees during the second quarter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net interest expense in the
second quarter of 2002 was $1.1 million less than the comparable period of 2001,
primarily reflecting a decrease in short-term interest expense due to a decrease
in the average short-term borrowing rates and reduced average short-term
borrowings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net income for the second
quarter increased $10.7 million, or 20%, from 2001 to 2002, and net income per
share - diluted increased $.08, or 21%. Excluding the after-tax effect of the
business realignment initiatives recorded in 2002, as well as the after-tax
effect of goodwill amortization in 2001, net income for the second quarter
increased $9.3 million, or 17%, from 2001 to 2002, and net income per share -
diluted increased $.07, or 18%. </FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<p><B><U>Results of Operations - First Six Months 2002 vs. First Six Months 2001</U></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Consolidated net sales for
the first six months increased from $1,805.3 million in 2001 to $1,812.0 million
in 2002. The sales increase primarily reflected increases in sales of key
confectionery brands in the United States, including new products and line
extensions, selected confectionery selling price increases, and incremental
sales from Visagis, the Brazilian chocolate and confectionery business acquired
in July 2001. These sales increases were substantially offset by lower sales
resulting from higher promotion allowances and returns, discounts, and
allowances, the rationalization of certain under-performing brands, including
the divestiture of the <I>Luden&#146;s</I> throat drop business in September
2001, and the timing of the acquisition of the Nabisco Inc. gum and mint
business which resulted in incremental sales in the first six months of 2001
compared to the same period of 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><font SIZE=3>The consolidated gross
margin increased from 36.0% in 2001 to 37.4% in 2002. The increase in gross
margin primarily reflected decreased costs for certain major raw materials,
primarily milk and cocoa, higher profitability resulting from the mix of
confectionery items sold in 2002 compared with sales in 2001 and selected
confectionery selling price increases. These increases in gross margin were
partially offset by higher promotion allowances and returns, discounts, and
allowances, both of which were higher as a percentage of sales compared to the
prior year. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased by 2% in
2002, primarily reflecting the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002.
Excluding the impact of goodwill amortization in 2001, selling, marketing, and
administrative expenses in 2002 were flat compared to 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net interest expense in the
first six months of 2002 was $2.9 million less than the comparable period of
2001, primarily reflecting a decrease in short-term interest expense due to a
decrease in average short-term borrowing rates and reduced average short-term
borrowings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net income for the first
six months of 2002 was $150.2 million compared to $131.3 million in 2001 and net
income per share-diluted was $1.09 per share compared to $ .95 per share in the
prior year. Excluding the after-tax effect of the business realignment
initiatives recorded in 2002, as well as the after-tax effect of goodwill
amortization in 2001, net

income for the first six months increased $19.9

$.14, or 14%. </FONT></P>

<p ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3><B><U>Business Realignment Initiatives</U></B></FONT></p

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In late October 2001, the
Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors approved a plan to improve the efficiency

improvements and a voluntary work force reduction program (&#147;VWRP&#148;). As
of June 30, 2002, the estimated costs for the business realignment initiatives
are expected to be slightly higher than planned, as higher pension settlement
costs associated with the VWRP which are recorded as incurred, are expected to
more than offset the impact of the greater than expected proceeds from the
Farley&#146;s and Sathers sale. A favorable adjustment of $4.4 million resulting
from the greater than expected proceeds was recorded during the second quarter
and included in the net business realignment charge. As of June 30, 2002, there
have been no significant changes to the estimated savings for the business
realignment initiatives. The major components of these initiatives remain on
schedule for completion by the fourth quarter of 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Asset management
improvements included the decision to outsource the manufacture of certain
ingredients and the related removal and disposal of machinery and equipment
related to the manufacture of these ingredients. As a result of this
outsourcing, the Corporation was able to significantly reduce raw material
inventories, primarily cocoa beans and cocoa butter, in the fourth quarter of
2001. The remaining portion of the project was substantially completed during
the first quarter of 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Product line
rationalization plans included the sale or exit of certain businesses, the
discontinuance of certain non-chocolate confectionery products and the
realignment of the Corporation&#146;s sales organizations. Costs associated with
the realignment of the sales organizations related primarily to sales office
closings and terminating the use of certain sales brokers. During the first and
second quarters of 2002, sales offices were closed as planned and the use of
certain sales brokers was discontinued. During the second quarter, the sale of a
group of Hershey&#146;s non-chocolate confectionery candy brands to
Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers Candy Company, Inc. was completed. Included in the
transaction were the HEIDE<SUP>&#174;</SUP>, JUJYFRUITS<SUP>&#174;</SUP>,
WUNDERBEANS<SUP>&#174;</SUP> and AMAZIN&#146; FRUIT<SUP>&#174;</SUP> trademarked
confectionery brands, as well as the rights to sell CHUCKLES<SUP>&#174;</SUP>
branded products, under license. Also, during the second quarter the Corporation
discontinued the sale of its aseptically packaged drink products in the United
States. Sales associated with these brands during the first and second quarters
are included in Note 2. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>To improve supply chain
efficiency and profitability, three manufacturing facilities, a distribution
center and certain other facilities were planned to be closed. These included
manufacturing facilities in Denver, Colorado; Pennsburg, Pennsylvania; and
Palmyra, Pennsylvania and a distribution center and certain minor facilities
located in Oakdale, California. During the first quarter of 2002, the
manufacturing facility in Palmyra, Pennsylvania was closed and additional costs
were recorded, as incurred, relating to retention payments. In addition, asset
disposals relating to the closure of the three manufacturing plants were begun.
During the second quarter, operations utilizing the distribution center in
Oakdale, California ceased and asset write-offs relating to the closure of the
three manufacturing plants continued. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT  SIZE=3>In  October 2001, the  Corporation  offered the VWRP to certain
eligible  employees  in the United  States,  Canada and Puerto  Rico in order to
reduce staffing levels and improve profitability. The VWRP consisted of an early
retirement program which provided enhanced pension,  post&nbsp;-&nbsp;retirement
and certain  supplemental  benefits and an enhanced  mutual  separation  program
which provided increased  severance and temporary medical benefits.  A reduction
of approximately 500 employees occurred during the first six months of 2002 as a
result of the VWRP. Additional pension settlement costs of $8.6 million and $6.4
million  before  tax were  recorded  in the first and second  quarters  of 2002,
respectively, principally associated with lump sum payments of pension benefits.

<p ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3><B><U>Liquidity and Capital Resources</U></B></FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Historically, the
Corporation&#146;s major source of financing has been cash generated from
operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which typically peak during
the summer months, generally have been met by issuing commercial paper. During
the first six months of 2002, the Corporation&#146;s cash and cash equivalents
increased by $50.6 million. Also during the period, the Corporation contributed
$129.7 million to its domestic pension plans. Cash provided from operations was
sufficient to fund dividend payments of $80.9 million and capital expenditures
and capitalized software additions totaling $54.0 million. Cash used by other
assets and liabilities of $51.5 million, primarily reflected pension plan
contributions, partially offset by commodities transactions. Cash provided from
other assets and liabilities in the second quarter of 2001 of $19.0 million was
principally the result of commodities transactions, partially offset by a
pension plan contribution and lower accrued liabilities associated with
marketing programs. </FONT></P>

<p align=center><font size=2>-14-</font></p>
<hr size=2 noshade>
<BR><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In order to improve the
funded status of the Corporation&#146;s domestic pension plans, a contribution
of $75.0 million was made in February 2001. Additional contributions of $95.0
million, $75.0 million and $54.7 million were made in December 2001 and in March
and June 2002, respectively, to fund payments related to the early retirement
program and to improve the funded status. These contributions were funded by
cash from operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The ratio of current assets
to current liabilities was 2.4:1 as of June 30, 2002, and 1.9:1 as of
December&#160;31, 2001. The Corporation&#146;s capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders&#146; equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 40% as of June 30, 2002, and 44% as of
December 31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<p><FONT SIZE=3><B><U>Other Matters</U></B></FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>A collective bargaining
agreement covering approximately 3,000 employees at two of the
Corporation&#146;s principal plants in Hershey, Pennsylvania expired in November
2001. On February 27, 2002, the employees voted not to ratify a new contract
offer, despite recommendations by their union negotiating committee and
executive board to approve the new contract. On April 17, 2002, the employees
voted again not to ratify an amended contract offer following the rejection of
that offer by the union negotiating committee. The Corporation and union
representatives continued negotiations with the assistance of a federal
mediator, but no settlement was reached and the employees went on strike
beginning April 26, 2002. The strike ended on June 6, 2002, when the employees
voted to ratify a new contract, with employees returning to work beginning on
June 8, 2002. The work stoppage did not have a material impact on the
Corporation&#146;s results of operations for the second quarter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>On July 25, 2002, the
Corporation confirmed that the Milton Hershey School Trust, which controls 77%
of the voting power of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock, has informed the
Corporation that is has decided to diversify its holdings and in this regard
wants Hershey Foods to explore a sale of the entire Corporation. There can be no
assurance that any transaction will be agreed upon or, if agreed upon, that it
will be consummated. </FONT></P>
