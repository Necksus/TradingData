<B><LI>DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES</B><BR><BR>

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, <I>&#147;&nbsp;Accounting
     for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp; (SFAS No.
     133). Subsequently, the FASB issued Statement No. 137, <I>&#147;&nbsp;Accounting for
     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective
     Date of FASB Statement No. 133, an amendment of FASB Statement No.
     133&#148;</I>&nbsp; and Statement No. 138, <I>&#147;&nbsp;Accounting for Certain Derivative
     Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement
     No. 133.&#148;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and
     reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded
     in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair
     value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be
     recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
     are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's
     gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income
     statement, to the extent effective, and requires that a company must
     formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions
     that receive hedge accounting.<BR><BR>

     The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001. The adoption of
     SFAS  No.  133  is  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on the
     Corporation's  results of operations and financial  position.  However,  as
     discussed  in  the  following  paragraphs,  SFAS  No.  133  could  increase
     volatility in other comprehensive income and involve certain changes in the
     Corporation's business practices.<BR><BR>

     SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of the gain
     or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow
     hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income
     and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during
     which the transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the
     derivative instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings.
     All derivative instruments currently utilized by the Corporation are
     designated as cash flow hedges.<BR><BR>


  <B>Objectives, Strategies and Accounting Policies Associated with Derivative Instruments</B><BR><BR>

     The Corporation utilizes certain derivative instruments, including interest
     rate swap agreements, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
     commodity futures contracts, to manage variability in cash flows associated
     with interest rate, currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk
     exposures. The interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are
     entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and
     do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. Commodity
     futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are intended and
     effective as hedges of market price risks associated with the purchase of
     raw materials for anticipated manufacturing requirements. If it is probable
     that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur either by the end of the
     originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period
     of time, derivative gains and losses reported in Accumulated Other
     Comprehensive Loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are immediately
     reclassified into earnings. Gains and losses on terminated derivatives
     designated as hedges are accounted for as part of the
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>- 7 -</FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<BR><BR>
     originally hedged transaction. Gains and losses on derivatives
     designated as hedges of items that mature or are sold or terminated, are
     recognized in income in the same period as the originally hedged
     transaction was anticipated to affect earnings. The Corporation utilizes
     derivative instruments as cash flow hedges and does not hold or issue
     derivative instruments for trading purposes. In entering into these
     contracts, the Corporation has assumed the risk that might arise from the
     possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.
     The Corporation does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty
     defaults.<BR><BR>


      <B>Interest Rate Swap Agreements</B><BR><BR>

     In order to  minimize  its  financing  costs  and to manage  interest  rate
     exposure,  the  Corporation,  from time to time,  enters into interest rate
     swap  agreements.  In February 2001, the Corporation  entered into interest
     rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
     payments  on certain  operating  leases  from a variable  to a fixed  rate.
     Rental  payments on  operating  leases  associated  with the  financing  of
     construction  of  a  warehouse  and  distribution  facility  near  Hershey,
     Pennsylvania  for $61.7  million  and the  financing  of the  purchase of a
     warehouse and distribution facility near Atlanta, Georgia for $18.2 million
     are  variable  based on the London  Interbank  Offered Rate  (LIBOR).  Such
     contingent  operating lease rental payments are forecasted  transactions as
     defined by SFAS No. 133,  as amended.  The  interest  rate swap  agreements
     effectively  convert the  interest-rate-contingent  rental  payments on the
     operating leases from LIBOR to a fixed rate of 6.1%. The interest rate swap
     agreements  qualify as cash flow hedges and the notional amounts,  interest
     rates and terms of the swap  agreements are consistent  with the underlying
     operating lease agreements they are intended to hedge and, therefore, there
     is no hedge  ineffectiveness.  Gains or  losses on the  interest  rate swap
     agreements are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in
     cost of sales as part of  shipping  and  distribution  expense  in the same
     period as the hedged rental payments affect earnings.<BR><BR>

     The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was determined based
     upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments
     and was included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Other Assets, with
     the offset reflected in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of income
     taxes. The Corporation's risk related to the interest rate swap
     agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing
     market rates<BR><BR>

     <B>Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts</B><BR><BR>

     The Corporation enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge
     transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase equipment,
     certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies,
     and to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-domestic
     subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate
     movements. Foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods
     from 3 to 24 months.<BR><BR>

     Foreign exchange forward contracts are intended and effective as hedges of
     firm, identifiable, foreign currency commitments. Since there is a direct
     relationship between the foreign currency derivatives and the foreign
     currency denomination of the transactions, foreign currency derivatives are
     highly effective in hedging cash flows related to transactions denominated
     in the corresponding foreign currencies. These contracts meet the criteria
     for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and, accordingly, gains or losses
     are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of
     sales or selling, marketing and administrative expense in the same period
     that the hedged items affect earnings.<BR><BR>

     The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was estimated by
     obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
     necessary for maturity differences, and was included on the Consolidated
     Balance Sheet as Accrued Liabilities with the offset reflected in
     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of income taxes.<BR><BR>

     <B>Commodities Futures Contracts</B><BR><BR>

     In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural
     gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements,
     the Corporation enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed
     appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. Commodity price
     risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. Commodities
     futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as cash
     flow hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses are included in other
     comprehensive income and are recognized ratably in cost of sales in the
     same period that the hedged raw material manufacturing requirements are
     recorded in cost of sales.<BR><BR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>- 8 -</FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<BR><BR>
     In  order  to  qualify  as a hedge  of  commodity  price  risk,  it must be
     demonstrated  that the  changes  in fair value of the  commodities  futures
     contracts  are highly  effective  in hedging  price risks  associated  with
     commodity purchases for manufacturing requirements. The assessment of hedge
     effectiveness for commodities  futures is performed on a quarterly basis by
     calculating  the  change  in switch  values  relative  to open  commodities
     futures  contracts being held and the number of futures contracts needed to
     price raw material  purchases for anticipated  manufacturing  requirements.
     Effectiveness is also monitored by tracking changes in basis  differentials
     as discussed below.  The prices of commodities  futures  contracts  reflect
     delivery to the same locations where the Corporation  takes delivery of the
     physical commodities and, therefore,  there is no ineffectiveness resulting
     from  differences  in location  between the derivative and the hedged item.
     Commodities  futures  contracts have been deemed to be highly  effective in
     hedging price risks associated with  corresponding  raw material  purchases
     for manufacturing requirements.<BR><BR>

     Because of the rollover strategy used for commodities futures contracts,
     which is required by futures market conditions, some ineffectiveness may
     result in hedging forecasted manufacturing requirements as futures
     contracts are switched from nearby contract positions to contract positions
     which are required to fix the price of raw material purchases for
     manufacturing requirements. Hedge ineffectiveness may also result from
     variability in basis differentials associated with the purchase of raw
     materials for manufacturing requirements. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured
     on a quarterly basis and the ineffective portion of gains or losses on
     commodities futures is recorded currently in cost of sales in accordance
     with SFAS No.133, as amended.<BR><BR>

     Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical
     forward purchase contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value
     of futures contracts are made on a daily basis and are included in
     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of income taxes, on the
     Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such cash transfers will be offset by higher or
     lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials and
     energy requirements in the future. Futures contracts being held in excess
     of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward
     contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated manufacturing requirements
     for each commodity. Physical commodity forward purchase contracts meet the
     SFAS No. 133 definition of &nbsp;&#147;normal purchases and sales&#148;&nbsp;
     and therefore are not considered derivative instruments.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>
     Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to
     income,  for  gains  or  losses  on cash  flow  hedging  derivatives,  were
     reflected  in cost  of  sales.  Losses  on cash  flow  hedging  derivatives
     recognized  in cost of  sales as a result  of  hedge  ineffectiveness  were
     approximately  $.9 million before tax in the second quarter with net losses
     of $.2 million recognized in cost of sales for the six months ended July 1,
     2001. No gains or losses were  reclassified  immediately  from  accumulated
     other comprehensive income into income as a result of the discontinuance of
     a hedge  because it became  probable that a hedged  forecasted  transaction
     would not occur.  There were no  components of gains or losses on cash flow
     hedging derivatives that were recognized immediately in income because such
     components     were    excluded    from    the    assessment    of    hedge
     effectiveness.<BR><BR>

     On the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet as of July 1, 2001,  Accumulated  Other
     Comprehensive  Loss of $77.6  million,  net of  income  taxes,  principally
     reflected  foreign  currency   translation   adjustments.   The  amount  of
     accumulated other  comprehensive  losses from cash flow hedging derivatives
     as of July 1&#130; 2001 was $20.7 million,  net of income taxes. As of July
     1&#130;  2001,  the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging  derivatives,
     including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements
     and  commodities  futures  contracts,  expected  to  be  reclassified  into
     earnings in the next twelve  months was  approximately  $15.1 million after

<B><LI>LONG-TERM DEBT</B><BR><BR>

     In August 1997, the Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement
     under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $500
     million of additional debt securities. As of July 1, 2001, $250 million of
     debt securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997
     Registration Statement.<BR><BR>

<B> <LI>  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</B><BR><BR>

     The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
     equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
     approximated fair value as of July 1, 2001 and December 31, 2000, because
     of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value
     of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $878.3 million as of
     July 1, 2001, compared to a fair value of $924.9 million, based on quoted
     market prices for the same or similar debt issues.<BR><BR>

     As of July 1, 2001, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward contracts
     maturing in 2001 and 2002 to purchase $49.8 million in foreign currency,
     primarily British sterling and euros, and to sell $7.0 million in foreign
     currency, primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.<BR><BR>

     The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
     obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
     necessary for maturity differences. As of July 1, 2001, the fair value of
     foreign exchange forward contracts approximated the contract value. The
     Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
     purposes.<BR><BR>

     In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
     exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
     swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest
     rate swap agreements that effectively convert interest-rate-contingent
     rental payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate
     of 6.1%.<BR><BR>

     Any interest rate differential on interest rate swap agreements is
     recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of each
     agreement. As of July 1, 2001, the fair value of interest rate swap
     agreements approximated the contract value. The Corporation's risk related
     to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such
     agreements at prevailing market rates.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>PENDING ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</B><BR><BR>

     The  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  (EITF) of the FASB  recently  addressed
     several issues related to the income  statement  classification  of certain
     sales incentives and marketing promotion  programs.  Consensuses reached on
     EITF Issue No. 00-14,  <I>&#147;&nbsp;Accounting  for Coupons,  Rebates and
     Discounts,&#148;</I>     &nbsp;&nbsp;and     EITF    Issue    No.    00-25,
     <I>&#147;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor    Income   Statement    Characterization    of
     Consideration  from a Vendor to a  Retailer,&#148;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;  require
     that certain consumer and trade promotion expenses, such as consumer coupon
     redemption   expense,   off-invoice   allowances   and  various   marketing
     performance   funds   currently   reported  in  selling,   marketing,   and
     administrative  expense be  recorded  as a  reduction  of net sales.  These
     reclassifications  are effective for the quarter  ending March 31, 2002. On
     an  annualized  basis,  these costs and  allowances  may range between $350
     million and $400 million.  These changes will not affect the  Corporation's
     financial position or net income. Upon adoption,  prior period amounts will
     be reclassified to conform with the new requirements.<BR><BR>

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statements of Financial  Accounting Standards
     No.                   141,                    <I>&#147;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business
     Combinations&#148;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;(SFAS    No.    141),    and   No.   142,
     <I>&#147;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill          and         Other         Intangible
     Assets&#148;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;(SFAS  No.  142).  SFAS  No.  141  changes  the
     accounting   for  business   combinations,   requiring  that  all  business
     combinations be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible
     assets be  recognized  as assets  apart  from  goodwill  if they arise from
     contractual  or other legal rights,  or if they are separable or capable of
     being separated from the acquired entity and sold,  transferred,  licensed,
     rented,  or  exchanged.   SFAS  No.  141  is  effective  for  all  business
     combinations  initiated  after June 30, 2001.  SFAS No. 142  specifies  the
     financial   accounting  and  reporting  for  acquired  goodwill  and  other
     intangible  assets.  Goodwill and  intangible  assets that have  indefinite
     useful  lives  will not be  amortized  but  rather  will be tested at least
     annually  for  impairment.  SFAS No.  142 is  effective  for  fiscal  years
     beginning after December 15, 2001.<BR><BR>

     SFAS No. 142 requires that the useful lives of intangible assets acquired
     on or before June 30, 2001 be reassessed and the remaining amortization
     periods adjusted accordingly. Previously recognized intangible assets
     deemed to have indefinite lives shall be tested for impairment. Goodwill
     recognized on or before June 30, 2001, shall be assigned to one or more
     reporting units and shall be tested for impairment as of the beginning of
     the fiscal year in which SFAS No. 142 is initially applied in its
     entirety.<BR><BR>

     The Corporation has not fully assessed the potential impact of the adoption
     of SFAS No. 142 which is  effective  for the  Corporation  as of January 1,
     2002. The  reassessment of intangible  assets must be completed  during the
     first quarter of 2002 and the  assignment  of goodwill to reporting  units,
     along with completion of the first step of the transitional
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>-11-</FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<BR><BR>
     goodwill impairment tests, must be completed during the first six months of
     2002.  The  Corporation  anticipates  that the  majority of the  intangible
     assets  and  goodwill  recognized  prior to July 1,  2001 will no longer be
     amortized  effective  January 1, 2002.  Total  amortization  of  intangible
     assets  and  goodwill  for the year  ended  December  31,  2000,  was $14.7
     million.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>SHARE REPURCHASES</B><BR><BR>

     In October 1999, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a share
     repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of the
     Corporation's Common Stock. Under this program, a total of 2,208,786 shares
     of Common Stock was purchased to date. As of July 1, 2001, a total of
     44,257,631 shares were held as Treasury Stock and $94.9 million remained
     available for repurchases of Common Stock under the repurchase
     program.</OL>

<B>Item 2.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Results of Operations  and
Financial Condition</B><BR><BR>

<B><U>Results of Operations - Second Quarter 2001 vs. Second Quarter 2000</U></B><BR>
<BR>

Consolidated net sales for the second quarter increased from $836.2 million in
2000 to $898.9 million in 2001, an increase of 7% from the prior year. The
higher sales primarily reflected incremental sales from the newly acquired mint
and gum business, increased international exports, and incremental sales from
the introduction of new confectionery products. These incremental sales were
offset partially by a decline in sales of base confectionery and grocery
products in the United States which resulted principally from: lower sales of
standard bars; a stock keeping unit (SKU) rationalization initiative begun in
2000, whereby the Corporation has discontinued selling many of its less
profitable products; and a reduction of inventories by the Corporation's
customers. The incremental sales were also offset in part by higher returns,
discounts, and allowances and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rates.<BR><BR>

The consolidated gross margin increased from 40.0% in 2000 to 42.5% in 2001. The
increase in gross margin primarily reflected decreased costs for freight,
distribution and warehousing, and lower costs for certain major raw materials,
primarily cocoa, as well as decreased costs for the disposal of aged inventory
and obsolete packaging. The profitability of the mint and gum business also
contributed to the higher gross margin in 2001. The impact of these items was
partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and returns, discounts, and
allowances, both of which were higher as a percentage of sales compared to the
prior year. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased by 13% in
2001, primarily reflecting selling, marketing and administrative expenditures
for the mint and gum business, increased administrative expenses primarily
reflecting higher staffing levels to support sales activity in North American
and international businesses, and increased marketing expenditures associated
with the introduction of new confectionery products.<BR><BR>

Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2001 was $.9 million less than the
comparable period of 2000, primarily reflecting a decrease in short-term
interest expense due to a decrease in the average short-term borrowing rates and
reduced average short-term borrowings.<BR><BR>

Net income for the second quarter was $52.4 million compared to $40.0 million
for the second quarter of 2000, and net income per share - diluted was $.38 per
share compared to $.29 per share in the prior year.<BR><BR>

<U><B>Results of Operations - First Six Months 2001 vs. First Six Months 2000</B></U><BR>
<BR>

Consolidated net sales for the first six months increased from $1,829.3 million
in 2000 to $1,979.1 million in 2001, an increase of 8% from the prior year. The
higher sales primarily reflected incremental sales from the newly acquired mint
and gum business and from the introduction of new confectionery products, as
well as increased international exports. These incremental sales were offset
partially by a decline in sales of base confectionery and grocery products in
the United States which resulted principally from: lower sales of standard bars;
the SKU rationalization initiative; and a reduction of inventories by the
Corporation's customers. The incremental sales were also offset, in part, by the
impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.<BR><BR>

The consolidated gross margin increased from 39.5% in 2000 to 41.7% in 2001. The
increase in gross margin primarily reflected decreased costs for freight,
distribution and warehousing, and certain major raw materials, primarily cocoa,
as well as decreased costs for the disposal of aged inventory and obsolete
packaging. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by the impact
of manufacturing costs, which were higher as a percentage of sales compared to
the prior year. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased by 15%
in 2001, primarily reflecting selling, marketing and administrative expenditures
for the mint and gum business, increased administrative expenses primarily
reflecting higher staffing levels to support sales activity in North American
and international businesses, and increased marketing expenditures associated
with the introduction of new confectionery products as well as base
confectionery and grocery brands. Selling, marketing and administrative costs in
2000 included a one-time gain of $7.3 million arising from the sale of certain
corporate aircraft.<BR><BR>

Net interest expense in the first six months of 2001 was $1.1 million less than
the comparable period of 2000, primarily reflecting a decrease in short-term
interest expense due to a decrease in average short-term borrowing rates and
reduced average short-term borrowings.<BR><BR>

Net income for the six months was $131.3 million compared to $111.2 million in
2000, and net income per share - diluted was $.95 per share compared to $.80 per
share in the prior year. Prior year net income included an after-tax gain of
$4.5 million, or $.03 per share - diluted, on the sale of certain corporate
aircraft.<BR><BR>

Capital Resources</U></FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Historically, the
Corporation&#146;s major source of financing has been cash generated from
operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which typically peak during
the summer months, generally have been met by issuing commercial paper. During
the first six months of 2001, the Corporation&#146;s cash and cash equivalents
decreased by $10.9 million. Cash provided from operating activities was
sufficient to fund a $75.0 million contribution to the Corporation&#146;s
domestic pension plans, finance capital additions and capitalized software
additions of $81.7 million, pay cash dividends of $74.5 million and finance the
repurchase of $29.6 million of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock. Changes in
cash flows provided from (used by) inventories and other assets and liabilities
exclude the impact of adjustments required by the adoption of SFAS No. 133. Cash
provided from other assets and liabilities of $39.9 million primarily reflected
commodities transactions and the contribution to the Corporation&#146;s domestic
pension plans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The ratio of current assets
to current liabilities was 1.6:1 as of July 1, 2001, and 1.7:1 as of

short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders&#146; equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 50% as of July 1, 2001, and 49% as of

The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and
interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse
change in market rates of ten percent was not material as of July 1, 2001. The
market risk resulting from a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten
percent associated with the estimated average fair value of net commodity
positions decreased from $3.0 million as of December 31, 2000, to ($.8) million
as of July 1, 2001. Market risk represents 10% of the estimated average fair
value of net commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period.</font>

Proceedings</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Corporation received
Notices of Proposed Deficiency (Notices) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
related to the years 1989 through 1998. The Notices pertained to the Corporate
Owned Life Insurance (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in
1989. The IRS disallowed the interest expense deductions associated with the
underlying life insurance policies. The total deficiency for years 1989 through
1996 of $61.2 million, inclusive of interest, was paid to the IRS in September
2000 to eliminate further accruing of interest. Assessments for federal taxes
and interest for 1997 and 1998 totaled $7.4 million. The Corporation is not
subject to any further assessments for federal taxes and interest, but may be
subject to additional assessments for state taxes and interest for 1989 through
1998. The Corporation believes that it has fully complied with tax law as it
relates to its COLI program, has filed for the refund of amounts paid and will
continue to seek favorable resolution of this matter. The Corporation has no
other material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation
incidental to its business. </FONT></P>
