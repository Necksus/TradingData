<B><LI>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</B><BR><BR>

     The accompanying  unaudited  consolidated  financial statements include the
     accounts  of  Hershey  Foods   Corporation   and  its   subsidiaries   (the
     &#147;Corporation&#148;)  after  elimination of  intercompany  accounts and
     transactions.  These  statements  have been prepared in accordance with the
     instructions  to Form 10-Q and do not  include all of the  information  and
     footnotes  required  by  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
     United  States  for  complete  financial  statements.  In  the  opinion  of
     management,  all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
     considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating
     results for the nine months ended  September 30, 2001, are not  necessarily
     indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
     31,  2001.  For  more  information,  refer  to the  consolidated  financial
     statements  and footnotes  included in the  Corporation&#146;s  2000 Annual
     Report on Form 10-K.<BR><BR>


<B><LI> BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE</B><BR><BR>

     In July  2001,  the  Corporation&#146;s  Brazilian  subsidiary,  Hershey do
     Brasil,  acquired the chocolate and  confectionery  business of Visagis for
     $17.1  million.  This  business had sales of  approximately  $20 million in
     2000.  Included in the acquisition are the  <I>IO-IO</I>  brand of hazelnut
     cr&egrave;me items and the chocolate and confectionery  products sold under
     the   <I>Visconti</I>   brand.   Also   included  in  the  purchase  are  a
     manufacturing   plant   and   confectionery   equipment   in   Sao   Roque,
     Brazil.<br><br>

     In   September   2001,   the   Corporation   completed   the  sale  of  the
     <I>Luden&#146;s&nbsp;</I>  throat  drops  business  to  Pharmacia  Consumer
     Healthcare,  a unit of Pharmacia Corporation.  Included in the sale are the
     trademarks and manufacturing equipment for the throat drops business. Under
     a  supply  agreement  with  Pharmacia,  the  Corporation  will  manufacture
     <I>Luden&#146;s</I>  throat  drops for up to 19  months.  Under a  separate
     services  agreement,  the Corporation will continue to sell,  warehouse and
     distribute  <I>Luden&#146;s</I>  throat drops  through  March 2002.  In the
     third  quarter of 2001,  the  Corporation  received  cash proceeds of $59.9
     million and recorded a gain of $19.2  million  before tax,  $1.1 million or
     $.01 per share - diluted  after  tax,  as a result  of the  transaction.  A
     higher gain for tax purposes  reflected  the low tax basis of the goodwill,
     property,  plant and  equipment,  and other  assets  included  in the sale,
     resulting in taxes on the gain of $18.1 million.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES</B><BR><BR>

     In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued
     Statement     of     Financial     Accounting     Standards     No.    133,
     <I>&#147;&nbsp;Accounting    for   Derivative   Instruments   and   Hedging
     Activities</I>&#148;&nbsp;  (SFAS No. 133).  Subsequently,  the FASB issued
     Statement  No. 137,  &#147;<I>Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and
     Hedging  Activities - Deferral of the Effective  Date of FASB Statement No.
     133, an amendment of FASB Statement No.  133</I>  &#148;  and Statement No.
     138,  <I>&#147;&nbsp;Accounting  for  Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and
     Certain   Hedging   Activities,   an  amendment  of  FASB   Statement   No.
     133.&#148;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting
     and  reporting  standards  requiring  that every  derivative  instrument be
     recorded in the balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at
     its fair value.  SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivatives fair
     value be recognized  currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting
     criteria  are  met.  Special  accounting  for  qualifying  hedges  allows a
     derivative's  gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item
     in the income  statement,  to the extent  effective,  and  requires  that a
     company must formally document,  designate, and assess the effectiveness of
     transactions that receive hedge accounting.
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2>-7-</FONT></P>
<hr size=2 noshade>
<br><Br>
     The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001. The adoption of
     &nbsp; SFAS  No.  133  is  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on the
     Corporation's  results of operations and financial  position.  However,  as
     discussed  in  the  following  paragraphs,  SFAS  No.  133  could  increase
     volatility in other comprehensive income and involve certain changes in the
     Corporation's business practices.<BR><BR>


     SFAS No. 133, as amended,  provides that the effective  portion of the gain
     or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow
     hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income
     and be  reclassified  into  earnings in the same  period or periods  during
     which the transaction  affects earnings.  The remaining gain or loss on the
     derivative  instrument,  if any, must be recognized  currently in earnings.
     All  derivative  instruments  currently  utilized  by the  Corporation  are
     designated as cash flow hedges.<BR><BR>

  <B>Objectives, Strategies and Accounting Policies Associated with Derivative Instruments</B>
<br><br>
     The Corporation utilizes certain derivative instruments, including interest
     rate swap  agreements,  foreign  currency  forward  exchange  contracts and
     commodity futures contracts, to manage variability in cash flows associated
     with interest rate,  currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk
     exposures.  The  interest  rate swaps and foreign  currency  contracts  are
     entered into for periods consistent with related  underlying  exposures and
     do not  constitute  positions  independent  of those  exposures.  Commodity
     futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are intended and
     effective as hedges of market price risks  associated  with the purchase of
     raw materials for anticipated manufacturing requirements. If it is probable
     that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur either by the end of the
     originally  specified time period or within an additional  two-month period
     of  time,  derivative  gains  and  losses  reported  in  Accumulated  Other
     Comprehensive  Loss  on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  are  immediately
     reclassified  into  earnings.  Gains and losses on  terminated  derivatives
     designated  as hedges are accounted  for as part of the  originally  hedged
     transaction.  Gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges of items
     that mature or are sold or terminated, are recognized in income in the same
     period as the  originally  hedged  transaction  was  anticipated  to affect
     earnings.  The  Corporation  utilizes  derivative  instruments as cash flow
     hedges  and  does  not hold or issue  derivative  instruments  for  trading
     purposes. In entering into these contracts, the Corporation has assumed the
     risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet
     the terms of their contracts. The Corporation does not expect any losses as
     a result of counterparty defaults.<BR><BR>

<BR>

   <B>Interest Rate Swap Agreements</B><br><br>

     In order to  minimize  its  financing  costs  and to manage  interest  rate
     exposure,  the  Corporation,  from time to time,  enters into interest rate
     swap  agreements.  In February 2001, the Corporation  entered into interest
     rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
     payments  on certain  operating  leases  from a variable  to a fixed  rate.
     Rental  payments on  operating  leases  associated  with the  financing  of
     construction  of  a  warehouse  and  distribution  facility  near  Hershey,
     Pennsylvania  for $61.7  million  and the  financing  of the  purchase of a
     warehouse and distribution facility near Atlanta, Georgia for $18.2 million
     are  variable  based on the London  Interbank  Offered Rate  (LIBOR).  Such
     contingent  operating lease rental payments are forecasted  transactions as
     defined by SFAS No. 133,  as amended.  The  interest  rate swap  agreements
     effectively  convert the  interest-rate-contingent  rental  payments on the
     operating leases from LIBOR to a fixed rate of 6.1%. The interest rate swap
     agreements  qualify as cash flow hedges and the notional amounts,  interest
     rates and terms of the swap  agreements are consistent  with the underlying
     operating lease agreements they are intended to hedge and, therefore, there
     is no hedge  ineffectiveness.  Gains or  losses on the  interest  rate swap
     agreements are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in
     cost of sales as part of  shipping  and  distribution  expense  in the same
     period as the hedged rental payments affect earnings.<BR><BR>

     The fair value of the interest rate swap  agreements was  determined  based
     upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial  instruments
     and was  included  on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet as Other  Long-term
     Liabilities,  with the offset reflected in Accumulated Other  Comprehensive
     Loss,  net of income  taxes.  The  Corporation&#146;s  risk  related to the
     interest  rate swap  agreements  is  limited to the cost of  replacing  the
     agreements at prevailing market rates.<BR><BR>

  <B>Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts</B><br><br>

     The Corporation  enters into foreign  exchange  forward  contracts to hedge
     transactions  primarily related to firm commitments to purchase  equipment,
     certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies,
     and to hedge payment of  intercompany  transactions  with its  non-domestic
     subsidiaries.  These  contracts  reduce  currency  risk from  exchange rate
     movements.  Foreign  currency price risks are hedged  generally for periods
     from 3 to 24 months.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2>-8-</FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE><br><BR>
     Foreign exchange forward  contracts are intended and effective as hedges of
     firm, identifiable,  foreign currency commitments.  Since there is a direct
     relationship  between  the  foreign  currency  derivatives  and the foreign
     currency denomination of the transactions, foreign currency derivatives are
     highly effective in hedging cash flows related to transactions  denominated
     in the corresponding foreign currencies.  These contracts meet the criteria
     for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and, accordingly,  gains or losses
     are included in other  comprehensive  income and are  recognized in cost of
     sales or selling,  marketing and administrative  expense in the same period
     that the hedged items affect earnings.<BR><BR>

     The fair value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  was  estimated  by
     obtaining  quotes for future  contracts with similar terms,  adjusted where
     necessary for maturity  differences,  and was included on the  Consolidated
     Balance  Sheet  as  Accrued   Liabilities  with  the  offset  reflected  in
     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of income taxes.<BR><BR>

   <B>Commodities Futures Contracts</B><BR><BR>

     In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural
     gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing  requirements,
     the  Corporation  enters  into  commodities  futures  contracts  as  deemed
     appropriate  to reduce the effect of price  fluctuations.  Commodity  price
     risks are hedged  generally  for periods  from 3 to 24 months.  Commodities
     futures  contracts  meet the hedge  criteria and are  accounted for as cash
     flow  hedges.   Accordingly,   gains  and  losses  are  included  in  other
     comprehensive  income  and are  recognized  ratably in cost of sales in the
     same period that the hedged raw  material  manufacturing  requirements  are
     recorded in cost of sales.<BR><BR>

     In  order  to  qualify  as a hedge  of  commodity  price  risk,  it must be
     demonstrated  that the  changes  in fair value of the  commodities  futures
     contracts  are highly  effective  in hedging  price risks  associated  with
     commodity purchases for manufacturing requirements. The assessment of hedge
     effectiveness for commodities  futures is performed on a quarterly basis by
     calculating  the  change  in switch  values  relative  to open  commodities
     futures  contracts being held and the number of futures contracts needed to
     price raw material  purchases for anticipated  manufacturing  requirements.
     Effectiveness is also monitored by tracking changes in basis  differentials
     as discussed below.  The prices of commodities  futures  contracts  reflect
     delivery to the same locations where the Corporation  takes delivery of the
     physical commodities and, therefore,  there is no ineffectiveness resulting
     from  differences  in location  between the derivative and the hedged item.
     Commodities  futures  contracts have been deemed to be highly  effective in
     hedging price risks associated with  corresponding  raw material  purchases
     for manufacturing requirements.<BR><BR>

     Because of the rollover  strategy used for commodities  futures  contracts,
     which is required by futures market conditions,  some  ineffectiveness  may
     result  in  hedging  forecasted   manufacturing   requirements  as  futures
     contracts are switched from nearby contract positions to contract positions
     which  are  required  to fix  the  price  of  raw  material  purchases  for
     manufacturing  requirements.  Hedge  ineffectiveness  may also  result from
     variability  in basis  differentials  associated  with the  purchase of raw
     materials for manufacturing requirements. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured
     on a  quarterly  basis and the  ineffective  portion  of gains or losses on
     commodities  futures is recorded  currently in cost of sales in  accordance
     with SFAS No.133, as amended.<BR><BR>

     Exchange  traded  futures  contracts  are used to fix the price of physical
     forward purchase contracts.  Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value
     of  futures  contracts  are  made on a daily  basis  and  are  included  in
     Accumulated  Other   Comprehensive  Loss,  net  of  income  taxes,  on  the
     Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such cash transfers will be offset by higher or
     lower cash  requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials and
     energy  requirements in the future.  Futures contracts being held in excess
     of the  amount  required  to fix the  price of  unpriced  physical  forward
     contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated manufacturing requirements
     for each commodity.  Physical commodity forward purchase contracts meet the
     SFAS   No.   133   definition   of&nbsp;    &#147;normal    purchases   and
     sales&#148;&nbsp;   and,   therefore,   are   not   considered   derivative
     instruments.

     Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to
     income,  for  gains  or  losses  on cash  flow  hedging  derivatives,  were
     reflected  in  cost  of  sales.  Gains  on cash  flow  hedging  derivatives
     recognized  in cost of  sales as a result  of  hedge  ineffectiveness  were
     approximately  $1.0 million  before tax in the third quarter with net gains
     of $.8  million  recognized  in cost of  sales  for the nine  months  ended
     September 30, 2001. No gains or losses were  reclassified  immediately from
     accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  into  income  as a result of the
     discontinuance  of a  hedge  because  it  became  probable  that  a  hedged
     forecasted  transaction would not occur.  There were no components of gains
     or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized immediately
     in income  because such  components  were excluded  from the  assessment of
     hedge effectiveness.<BR><BR>



     On the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet as of September  30, 2001,  Accumulated
     Other Comprehensive Loss of $74.1 million, net of income taxes, principally
     reflected  foreign  currency   translation   adjustments.   The  amount  of
     accumulated other  comprehensive  losses from cash flow hedging derivatives
     as of  September  30, 2001 was $7.0  million,  net of income  taxes.  As of
     September  30,  2001,  the  amount  of net  losses  on  cash  flow  hedging
     derivatives,  including foreign exchange forward  contracts,  interest rate
     swap  agreements  and  commodities   futures  contracts,   expected  to  be
     reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately $6.3
     million after tax.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>LONG-TERM DEBT</B><BR><BR>

     In August 1997, the  Corporation  filed a Form S-3  Registration  Statement
     under which it could offer,  on a delayed or continuous  basis,  up to $500
     million of  additional  debt  securities.  As of September  30, 2001,  $250
     million of debt securities remained available for issuance under the August
     1997 Registration Statement.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</B><BR><BR>

     The  carrying  amounts of  financial  instruments  including  cash and cash
     equivalents,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable and short-term  debt
     approximated  fair value as of  September  30, 2001 and  December 31, 2000,
     because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying
     value of long-term debt,  including the current portion, was $878.1 million
     as of September 30, 2001, compared to a fair value of $962.3 million, based
     on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues.<BR><BR>

     As of September 30, 2001,  the  Corporation  had foreign  exchange  forward
     contracts  maturing primarily in 2001 and 2002 to purchase $41.8 million in
     foreign  currency,  primarily  British sterling and euros, and to sell $8.6
     million in foreign currency,  primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward
     rates.<BR><BR>

     The fair  value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  is  estimated  by
     obtaining  quotes for future  contracts with similar terms,  adjusted where
     necessary  for maturity  differences.  As of September  30, 2001,  the fair
     value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  approximated  the  contract
     value.  The Corporation  does not hold or issue  financial  instruments for
     trading purposes.<BR><BR>

     In order to  minimize  its  financing  costs  and to manage  interest  rate
     exposure,  the  Corporation,  from time to time,  enters into interest rate
     swap  agreements.  In February 2001, the Corporation  entered into interest
     rate swap  agreements  that  effectively  convert  interest-rate-contingent
     rental payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate
     of 6.1%.<BR><BR>

     Any  interest  rate  differential  on  interest  rate  swap  agreements  is
     recognized  as an  adjustment  to  interest  expense  over the term of each
     agreement.  As of September 30, 2001,  the fair value of interest rate swap
     agreements  approximated the contract value. The Corporation's risk related
     to interest rate swap  agreements is limited to the cost of replacing  such
     agreements at prevailing market rates.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>PENDING ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</B><BR><BR>

     The  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  (EITF) of the FASB  recently  addressed
     several issues related to the income  statement  classification  of certain
     sales incentives and marketing promotion  programs.  Consensuses reached on
     EITF Issue No. 00-14,  &#147;<I>Accounting for Coupons,  Rebates and Discounts</I>,&#148;  and
     EITF  Issue  No.  00-25,  &#147; <I>Vendor  Income  Statement   Characterization  of
     Consideration  from a Vendor to a Retailer,</I>&#148;  require that certain  consumer
     and trade promotion  expenses,  such as consumer coupon redemption expense,
     off-invoice  allowances and various  marketing  performance funds currently
     reported in selling, marketing, and administrative expense be recorded as a
     reduction  of net sales.  These  reclassifications  are  effective  for the
     quarter  ending March 31, 2002.  On an  annualized  basis,  these costs and
     allowances  may range between $400 million and $425 million.  These changes
     will not affect the Corporation's<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2>-11-</FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<br><BR>
     financial position or net income. Upon adoption,  prior period amounts will
     be reclassified to conform with the new requirements.<BR><BR>

     In June 2001, the FASB issued Statements of Financial  Accounting Standards
     No. 141, "<I>Business Combinations</I>" (SFAS No. 141), and No. 142, "<I>Goodwill and
     Other  Intangible  Assets</I>"  (SFAS  No.  142).  SFAS  No.  141  changes  the
     accounting   for  business   combinations,   requiring  that  all  business
     combinations be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible
     assets be  recognized  as assets  apart  from  goodwill  if they arise from
     contractual  or other legal rights,  or if they are separable or capable of
     being separated from the acquired entity and sold,  transferred,  licensed,
     rented,  or  exchanged.   SFAS  No.  141  is  effective  for  all  business
     combinations  initiated  after June 30, 2001.  SFAS No. 142  specifies  the
     financial   accounting  and  reporting  for  acquired  goodwill  and  other
     intangible  assets.  Goodwill and  intangible  assets that have  indefinite
     useful  lives  will not be  amortized  but  rather  will be tested at least
     annually  for  impairment.  SFAS No.  142 is  effective  for  fiscal  years
     beginning after December 15, 2001.<BR><BR>

     SFAS No. 142 requires that the useful lives of intangible  assets  acquired
     on or before June 30, 2001 be  reassessed  and the  remaining  amortization
     periods  adjusted  accordingly.  Previously  recognized  intangible  assets
     deemed to have indefinite  lives shall be tested for  impairment.  Goodwill
     recognized  on or before  June 30,  2001,  shall be assigned to one or more
     reporting  units and shall be tested for  impairment as of the beginning of
     the fiscal year in which SFAS No.142 is initially applied in its entirety.<BR><BR>

     The Corporation has not fully assessed the potential impact of the adoption
     of SFAS No. 142 which is  effective  for the  Corporation  as of January 1,
     2002. The  reassessment of intangible  assets must be completed  during the
     first quarter of 2002 and the  assignment  of goodwill to reporting  units,
     along  with  completion  of the  first  step of the  transitional  goodwill
     impairment  tests,  must be completed  during the first six months of 2002.
     The Corporation  anticipates that the majority of the intangible assets and
     goodwill  recognized  prior to July 1, 2001  will no  longer  be  amortized
     effective  January 1, 2002.  Total  amortization  of intangible  assets and
     goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $14.7 million.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>SHARE REPURCHASES</B><BR><BR>

     In October  1999,  the  Corporation's  Board of Directors  approved a share
     repurchase program  authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of the
     Corporation's Common Stock. Under this program, a total of 2,388,586 shares
     of Common Stock was purchased to date. As of September 30, 2001, a total of
     44,420,608  shares were held as Treasury  Stock and $84.2 million  remained
     available for repurchases of Common Stock under the repurchase program.<BR><BR>

<B><LI>SUBSEQUENT EVENT</B><BR><BR>

     On October 24, 2001, the Corporation  announced  initiatives to enhance its
     future operating  performance by focusing on:  profitable,  organic growth;
     ongoing  margin  improvement;   superior  asset  management;   and  a  more
     streamlined,  results-driven organization.  Business realignment charges to
     support the initiatives totaling $275 million pre-tax, or $1.24 per share -
     diluted,  will be recorded in the fourth  quarter of 2001 and in 2002.  The
     charges  will  include  restructuring  charges of $218  million or $.99 per
     share - diluted  and  operating  charges of $57 million or $.25 per share -
     diluted. $1.08 per share - diluted is expected to be recorded in the fourth
     quarter of 2001 and $.16 per share - diluted is  expected to be recorded in
     2002. These business  realignment  initiatives will generate ongoing annual
     savings of $60 million to $65 million when fully implemented, which will be
     reinvested  to create  enhanced  marketing and selling  capabilities.  Cash
     flows  for the  business  will  immediately  increase  as a result of these
     initiatives.<BR><BR>

     The restructuring  charges will include costs related to the elimination of
     certain  non-strategic  brands,  the elimination of underutilized  capacity
     through the closure of three manufacturing  facilities and one distribution
     center,  realignment  of the  sales  organization,  a  voluntary  workforce
     reduction  program,  and  outsourcing  the production of cocoa powder.  The
     operating  charges will include  costs  related to selling off and reducing
     raw material  inventories,  principally  cocoa beans, no longer required to
     support  operations and write-downs of inventory  related to products to be
     discontinued.<BR><BR>

<B>Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition</B><BR><BR>

<B><U>Results of Operations - Third Quarter 2001 vs. Third Quarter 2000</U></B><BR><BR>

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter  increased from $1,196.8 million in
2000 to $1,304.2  million in 2001,  an  increase of 9% from the prior year.  The
higher sales primarily reflected  incremental sales from the newly acquired mint
and gum  business,  an  increase  in sales  of base  confectionery  and  grocery
products  in North  America,  incremental  sales  from the  introduction  of new
confectionery  products and selling price  increases on certain  packaged  candy
products.  These  incremental  sales  were  offset  partially  by the  impact of
unfavorable  foreign currency  exchange rates,  higher returns,  discounts,  and
allowances,  and the divestiture of the <I>Luden's</I>  throat drops business in
early September.<BR><BR>

The consolidated gross margin increased from 41.8% in 2000 to 42.3% in 2001. The
increase in gross margin was achieved  via  improved  supply chain  efficiencies
including  decreased  costs for the disposal of aged inventory and reduced costs
for freight, distribution and warehousing. The profitability of the mint and gum
business  also  contributed  to the higher gross  margin in 2001.  The impact of
these  items  was  partially  offset by higher  manufacturing  costs,  primarily
related to higher labor rates and employee  benefits  costs, as well as start-up
costs  associated with the  installation  of new  manufacturing  equipment,  and
higher returns, discounts, and allowances. Selling, marketing and administrative
expenses increased by 13% in 2001, primarily  reflecting selling,  marketing and
administrative   expenditures   for  the  mint  and  gum   business,   increased
administrative  expenses  primarily  resulting  from higher  staffing  levels to
support  sales  activity in North  American and  international  businesses,  and
increased  marketing  expenditures  associated  with  the  introduction  of  new
confectionery products.<BR><BR>

Net interest expense in the third quarter of 2001 was $3.0 million less than the
comparable period of 2000,  reflecting a decrease in short-term interest expense
due to a decrease in the average short-term  borrowing rates and reduced average
short-term borrowings.
<BR><BR>
Net income for the third quarter was $120.8  million  compared to $107.4 million
for the third  quarter of 2000,  and net income per share - diluted was $.88 per
share  compared  to $.78 per share in the prior year.  In  September  2001,  the
Corporation  recorded  a gain of  $19.2  million,  $1.1  million  or  $0.01  per
share-diluted after-tax, on the sale of its <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Results of Operations - First Nine Months 2001 vs. First Nine Months 2000</U></B>
<BR><BR>
Consolidated net sales for the first nine months increased from $3,026.1 million
in 2000 to $3,283.3  million in 2001, an increase of 9% from the prior year. The
higher sales primarily reflected  incremental sales from the newly acquired mint
and gum business and from the  introduction of new  confectionery  products,  as
well as an increase in sales of base confectionery and grocery products in North
America,  and increased  international  exports.  These  incremental  sales were
offset partially by the impact of unfavorable  foreign currency  exchange rates,
the  divestiture  of the  <I>Luden's</I>  throat  drops  business,  and higher  returns,
discounts, and allowances.<BR><BR>

The consolidated gross margin increased from 40.4% in 2000 to 41.9% in 2001. The
increase in gross margin resulted from decreased costs for freight, distribution
and  warehousing,  and certain major raw materials,  primarily cocoa, as well as
improved supply chain efficiencies including decreased costs for the disposal of
aged inventory and obsolete  packaging.  The  profitability  of the mint and gum
business  also  contributed  to the higher gross  margin in 2001.  The impact of
these  items  was  partially  offset by higher  manufacturing  costs,  primarily
related to higher labor rates and employee  benefits  costs, as well as start-up
costs associated with the installation of new manufacturing equipment.  Selling,
marketing  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by 14% in  2001,  primarily
reflecting selling,  marketing and administrative  expenditures for the mint and
gum business,  increased administrative expenses primarily resulting from higher
staffing  levels to support sales activity in North  American and  international
businesses,   and  increased   marketing   expenditures   associated   with  the
introduction   of   new   confectionery   products.   Selling,   marketing   and
administrative  costs in 2000 included a one-time  gain of $7.3 million  arising
from the sale of certain corporate aircraft.<BR><BR>

Net interest expense in the first nine months of 2001 was $4.2 million less than
the  comparable  period of 2000,  reflecting a decrease in  short-term  interest
expense  due to a decrease  in average  short-term  borrowing  rates and reduced
average short-term borrowings.<BR><BR>

Net income for the first nine  months  was  $252.1  million  compared  to $218.6
million in 2000, and net income per share - diluted was $1.83 per share compared
to $1.58  per  share in the prior  year.  In  September  2001,  the  Corporation
recorded  a

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2>-13-</FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<BR><BR>
gain of $19.2 million,  $1.1 million or $0.01 per share - diluted after-tax,  on
the sale of its  <I>Luden's</I>  throat  drops  business.  A higher gain for tax
purposes  reflected  the low tax  basis of the  goodwill,  property,  plant  and
equipment, and other assets included in the sale, resulting in taxes on the gain
of $18.1  million.  Prior year net income  included  an  after-tax  gain of $4.5
million, or $.03 per share - diluted, on the sale of certain corporate aircraft.
<BR><BR>
<B><U>Liquidity and Capital Resources</U></B><BR><BR>

Historically,  the  Corporation's  major  source  of  financing  has  been  cash
generated from  operations.  Domestic  seasonal  working  capital  needs,  which
typically  peak  during the summer  months,  generally  have been met by issuing
commercial paper.  During the first nine months of 2001, the Corporation's  cash
and cash  equivalents  increased by $17.2 million.  Cash provided from operating
activities was sufficient to finance capital additions and capitalized  software
additions of $120.6 million,  pay cash dividends of $114.6 million,  and finance
the repurchase of $40.3 million of the  Corporation's  Common Stock.  Changes in
cash flows provided from (used by)  inventories and other assets and liabilities
exclude the impact of adjustments required by the adoption of SFAS No. 133. Cash
provided from other assets and liabilities of $170.2 million primarily reflected
commodities  transactions  and  increases  in accrued  income  taxes and accrued
liabilities  for  payroll and  employee  benefits,  partially  offset by a $75.0
million contribution to the Corporation's domestic pension plans.<BR><BR>

Investing activities included capital additions,  a business acquisition,  and a
business  divestiture.  In July 2001, the  Corporation's  Brazilian  subsidiary,
Hershey do Brasil,  acquired the chocolate and confectionery business of Visagis
for $17.1 million.  In September 2001, the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business was sold
for $59.9 million in cash.<BR><BR>

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.7:1 as of&nbsp; September 30,
2001 and  December  31,  2000.  The  Corporation's  capitalization  ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders'  equity,  short-term
and long-term debt) was 47% as of&nbsp; September 30, 2001, and 49% as of&nbsp; December 31,
2000.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Subsequent Event</U></B><BR><BR>

On October 24, 2001, the Corporation announced initiatives to enhance its future
operating performance by focusing on: profitable, organic growth; ongoing margin
improvement;  superior asset management; and a more streamlined,  results-driven
organization.  Business  realignment charges to support the initiatives totaling
$275  million  pre-tax,  or $1.24 per share - diluted,  will be  recorded in the
fourth  quarter of 2001 and in 2002.  The  charges  will  include  restructuring
charges of $218 million or $.99 per share - diluted and operating charges of $57
million or $.25 per share - diluted. $1.08 per share - diluted is expected to be
recorded in the fourth  quarter of 2001 and $.16 per share - diluted is expected
to be recorded in 2002.  These business  realignment  initiatives  will generate
ongoing  annual  savings of $60 million to $65 million  when fully  implemented,
which will be reinvested to create enhanced marketing and selling  capabilities.
Cash  flows for the  business  will  immediately  increase  as a result of these
initiatives.<BR><BR>

The  restructuring  charges will include  costs  related to the  elimination  of
certain non-strategic brands, the elimination of underutilized  capacity through
the  closure of three  manufacturing  facilities  and one  distribution  center,
realignment of the sales organization,  a voluntary workforce reduction program,
and  outsourcing  the  production  of cocoa powder.  The operating  charges will
include  costs  related to selling off and reducing  raw  material  inventories,
principally   cocoa  beans,  no  longer  required  to  support   operations  and
write-downs of inventory related to products to be discontinued.<BR><BR>

<br><br>
<B>Item 1 - Legal Proceedings</B>
<br><br>
Effective  October 1, 2001, the  Corporation  negotiated  a  settlement  with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of  Notices of Proposed Deficiency  associated
with its Corporate Owned Life Insurance  (COLI) program. The resulting  Closing
Agreement  with the IRS limited the COLI  interest  expense  deductions  for all
applicable  tax years and resulted in the surrender of all  insurance  policies,
thereby ending the COLI program.  The settlement is a complete resolution of all
federal and state tax aspects of this program.  This  resolution will not impact
the  Corporation's  effective  income  tax rate.  The  Corporation  has no other
material  pending  legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine  litigation
incidental to its business.<BR><BR>
