NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial
     statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its
     subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
     transactions.  These statements reflect all adjustments which are,
     in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
     the information contained herein.  All such adjustments were of a
     normal and recurring nature.  Certain reclassifications have been
     made to prior year amounts to conform to the 1996 presentations.

2.   Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

                                          For the Six Months Ended
                                      June 30, 1996        July 2, 1995
                                                                       
                                         (in thousands of dollars)

     Interest expense                    $26,807            $19,318      
     Interest income                      (2,155)            (1,572)     
     Capitalized interest                 (1,470)              (753)     
                                                                    
        Interest expense, net            $23,182            $16,993      
                                                                    

3.   Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average
     number of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
     outstanding during the period.  Average shares outstanding during the
     second quarter and six months ended June 30, 1996 were 77,144,016 and
     77,228,795, respectively, and were 86,637,997 and 86,683,439 for the
     respective periods in 1995.  There were no shares of Preferred Stock
     outstanding during the periods presented.

     A total of 4,266,005 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased
     under share repurchase programs which began in 1993.  Of the total
     shares repurchased, 264,000 shares were retired and the remainder
     were held as Treasury Stock as of June 30, 1996.  In addition, in
     August 1995, the Corporation purchased 9,049,773 shares of its Common
     Stock from Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of
     Milton Hershey School.  A total of 13,051,778 shares were held as
     Treasury Stock as of June 30, 1996.

4.   The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out
     (LIFO) method.  The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
     first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.  Inventories were as
     follows:
                                        June 30, 1996    December 31, 1995
                                                                        
                                           (in thousands of dollars)

     Raw materials                        $249,837           $189,371
     Goods in process                       38,563             28,201
     Finished goods                        329,388            249,106 
                                                                     
        Inventories at FIFO                617,788            466,678
     Adjustment to LIFO                    (74,586)           (69,108)
                                                                     
        Total inventories                 $543,202           $397,570

 5.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax
     restructuring charge of $106.1 million following a comprehensive
     review of domestic and international operations designed to enhance
     performance of operating assets by lowering operating and
     administrative costs, eliminating underperforming assets and
     streamlining the overall decision-making process.  The restructuring
     program was essentially complete as of June 30, 1996.

 6.  In June 1995, the Corporation completed the sale of the outstanding
     shares of Overspecht B.V. (OZF Jamin) to a management buyout group
     at OZF Jamin, as part of the restructuring program announced by the
     Corporation in late 1994.  The Corporation purchased the outstanding
     shares of OZF Jamin in October 1993 for approximately $20.2 million.

 7.  In January 1996, the Corporation completed the sale of the assets of
     Hershey Canada, Inc.'s PLANTERS nut (Planters) and LIFE SAVERS and
     BREATH SAVERS hard candy, and BEECH-NUT cough drop (Life Savers)
     businesses to Johnvince Foods Group and Beta Brands Inc.,
     respectively.  Both transactions were part of the Corporation's
     restructuring program.

 8.  In December 1995, the Corporation completed the acquisition of the
     outstanding shares of the confectionery company Henry Heide,
     Incorporated (Henry Heide), for approximately $12.5 million.  Henry
     Heide's manufacturing facility is located in New Brunswick, N.J.,
     where it manufactures a variety of non-chocolate confectionery
     products including JUJYFRUITS candies and WUNDERBEANS jellybeans.

     The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and,
     accordingly, results subsequent to the date of acquisition are
     included in the consolidated financial statements.  Had the results
     of the Henry Heide acquisition been included in consolidated results
     for the full corresponding six-month period of 1995, the effect would
     not have been material.

 9.  In October 1995, the Corporation issued $200 million of 6.7% Notes
     due 2005 (Notes) under Form S-3 Registration Statements which were
     declared effective in June 1990 and November 1993.  The proceeds from
     issuance of the Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings. 

10.  The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
     equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term
     debt approximated fair value as of June 30, 1996 and December 31,
     1995, because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. 
     The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion,
     also approximated fair value as of June 30, 1996 and December 31,
     1995, based upon quoted market prices, as of those dates, for the
     same or similar debt issues.

     As of June 30, 1996, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
     contracts maturing in 1996 and 1997 to purchase $23.1 million in
     foreign currency, primarily British sterling, German marks, and Irish
     punt, and to sell $18.6 million in foreign currency, primarily
     Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.

     As of December 31, 1995, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
     contracts maturing in 1996 and 1997 to purchase $54.7 million in
     foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars, British sterling and
     Swiss francs, and to sell $26.4 million in foreign currency,
     
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 8     
     primarily Italian lira, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at
     contracted forward rates.  Additionally, as of December 31, 1995, the
     Corporation had purchased foreign exchange options of $11.5 million
     and written foreign exchange options of $8.9 million, principally
     related to British sterling.  Such options expired or were settled
     in the first quarter of 1996.

     The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
     obtaining  quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted
     where necessary for maturity differences, and the fair value of
     foreign exchange options is estimated using active market quotations. 
     As of June 30, 1996 and December 31, 1995, the fair value of foreign
     exchange forward and options contracts approximated carrying value. 
     The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for
     trading purposes.

     In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
     exposure, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements
     in the fourth quarter of 1995 to effectively convert a portion of its
     floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.  As of June 30, 1996, the
     Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional
     amount of $200.0 million with maturities through 1997.  As of June
     30, 1996, interest rates payable were at a weighted average fixed
     rate of 5.6% and interest rates receivable were floating based on 30-
     day commercial paper composite rates.  Any interest rate differential
     on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment to interest
     expense during the period.  The Corporation's risk related to swap
     agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at
     current market rates.

11.  Reference is made to the Registrant's 1995 Annual Report on Form 10-K
     for more detailed financial statements and footnotes.

               Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - Second Quarter 1996 vs. Second Quarter 1995

Consolidated net sales for the second quarter rose from $722.3
million in 1995 to $796.3 million in 1996, an increase of 10% from
the prior year.  The higher sales primarily reflected incremental
sales from new confectionery and grocery products, confectionery
selling price increases in the United States and incremental sales
from the acquisition of Henry Heide.  These increases were offset
somewhat by reduced sales volume for existing domestic
confectionery and pasta brands and lower sales resulting from the
divestitures of OZF Jamin in April 1995 and the Planters and Life
Savers businesses in January 1996.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.3% in 1995 to 41.0%
in 1996.  The decrease was primarily the result of higher costs for
certain major raw materials, particularly milk and cocoa beans, and
increased manufacturing costs primarily attributable to production
start-up and manufacturing of new products.  These cost increases
were partially offset by confectionery price increases.  Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses increased by 5%, due to
increased advertising and promotion expenses principally associated
with the introduction of new products.

Net interest expense in the second quarter of 1996 was $3.1 million
above the comparable period of 1995 primarily as a result of higher
fixed interest expense related to the issuance in October 1995 of
$200 million of 6.7% Notes due 2005 (Notes).  The proceeds from the
issuance of the Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings
required to fund capital additions, payment of cash dividends,
share repurchases and working capital requirements. 

The second quarter effective income tax rate increased from 39.3%
in 1995 to 40.1% in 1996.  The lower rate in 1995 was due primarily
to the impact of changes in Pennsylvania state tax regulations
which included a June 1995 reduction in the state income tax rate
which was retroactive to January 1, 1995.

Results of Operations - First Six Months 1996 vs. First Six Months
1995

Consolidated net sales for the first six months of 1996 increased
by $138.1 million or 9% as a result of incremental sales from new
confectionery and grocery products, confectionery selling price
increases in the  United States and incremental sales from the
acquisition of Henry Heide.  The increases were offset somewhat as
a result of the divestitures of OZF Jamin in the second quarter of
1995 and the Planters and Life Savers businesses in January 1996.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.7% in 1995 to 41.0%
in 1996.  The decrease was primarily the result of higher costs for
certain major raw materials, primarily cocoa beans, milk and durum
semolina, and increased manufacturing costs attributable to
production start-up and manufacturing of new products, along with
adverse weather conditions in the first quarter.  These cost
increases were partially offset by confectionery price increases
and the favorable impact of the OZF Jamin divestiture.  Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses increased by 6%, primarily
due to increased advertising and promotion expenses principally

<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 10

associated with the introduction of new products.

Net interest expense was $6.2 million above prior year, primarily
reflecting higher fixed interest expense resulting from the
issuance of $200 million of Notes in October 1995.

The effective income tax rate increased from 39.9% in 1995 to 40.1%
in 1996.  The higher rate in 1996 was due primarily to changes in
the mix of the Corporation's income among various tax
jurisdictions.

Financial Condition

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
cash generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital
needs, which typically peak during the summer, generally have been
met by issuing commercial paper.  During the first six months of
1996, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents increased by
$15.9 million.  Cash provided from operations, the divestiture of
the Planters and Life Savers businesses and short-term borrowings
was sufficient to finance capital additions of $70.2 million, pay
cash dividends of $54.6 million and fund share repurchases of $24.8
million.  The increase in cash provided from operations primarily
reflected favorable changes in accrued liabilities and
restructuring reserve balances and higher income compared to 1995,
partially offset by reduced cash resulting from increases in
accounts receivable balances versus the prior year.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 as of
June 30, 1996 and December 31, 1995.  The Corporation's
capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a
percent of stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was
42% as of June 30, 1996 and December 31, 1995.

In December 1995, the Corporation entered into committed credit
facility agreements with a syndicate of banks under which it could
borrow up to $600 million as of June 30, 1996, with options to
increase borrowings by $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the
banks.  Of the total committed credit facility, $200 million is for
a renewable 364-day term and $400 million is effective for a five-
year term.  The credit facilities may be used to fund general
corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and,
in certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions.  In
addition, as of June 30, 1996 and July 2, 1995, the Corporation had
lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks in
the amount of approximately $100 million and $470 million,
respectively, which could be borrowed directly or used to support
the issuance of commercial paper.

In October 1995, the Corporation issued $200 million of Notes under
Form S-3 Registration Statements which were declared effective in
June 1990 and November 1993.  As of June 30, 1996, $300 million of
debt securities remained available for issuance under the November
1993 Registration Statement.  Proceeds from any offering of the
$300 million of debt securities available under the shelf
registration may be used for general corporate requirements,
including reducing existing commercial paper borrowings, financing
capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.

In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Corporation entered into
interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of
its floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.  As of June 30, 1996,
the Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate
notional amount of $200.0 million, with maturities through 1997. 
Any interest rate differential on interest rate swaps is recognized
as an adjustment to interest expense during the period.

As of June 30, 1996, the Corporation's principal capital
commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion and
modernization.  The Corporation anticipates that capital
expenditures will be in the range of $150 million to $225 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of capacity
expansion to support new products and line extensions and continued
modernization of existing facilities.

Subsequent Event

On August 6, 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors declared a
two-for-one split of the Corporation's Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock to stockholders of record August 23, 1996.  The split
will be effected as a stock dividend by distributing one additional
share for each share currently held.  The additional stock
certificates will be mailed on September 13, 1996.

                Hershey Declares 2-for-1 Stock Split
                           Dividends Increased
                                    
                                    
                                    
HERSHEY, Pa. --- The Board of Directors of Hershey Foods
Corporation today declared a two-for-one split of the
Corporation s Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to
stockholders of record August 23, 1996.  The split will be
effected by distributing one additional share for each share
currently held.  The additional stock certificates will be mailed
on September 13, 1996.

The Board of Directors also increased the quarterly dividend on
the Common Stock on a pre-split basis, from $.36 to $.40 per
share or 11.1 percent.  In addition, the Board increased the
quarterly dividend on the Class B Common Stock on a pre-split
basis, from $.325 to $.36 per share or 10.8 percent. 
The dividends are payable September 13, 1996, to stockholders of
record August 23, 1996.

                                 - MORE -

<PAGE>
This is the 267th consecutive regular dividend and 22nd
consecutive annual increase on the Common Stock and the 48th
consecutive regular dividend and 12th consecutive annual increase
on the Class B Common Stock.

Stockholders are advised that the two-for-one split will increase
their number of shares in the Corporation, but will not change
their proportionate stockholder's interest.  The old certificates
now in stockholders' possession are valid and should not be
destroyed nor should they be returned to the Corporation.  They
continue to represent the number of shares shown on their face.

"This two-for-one stock split and increase in dividends reflects
our confidence in the future profitable growth of the
Corporation," said Kenneth L. Wolfe, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer.  "The stock split will place Hershey s stock in a more
popular price range and should enhance trading liquidity in our
stock.  The dividend increase reflects an understanding of our
stockholders' need for an adequate return on their investment, as
well as the cash requirements of our businesses."
