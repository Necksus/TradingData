 <P ALIGN=CENTER><Font size=3> <B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B></P>
<OL>
 <B> <LI>   BASIS OF PRESENTATION</B>
<BR><BR>
       The accompanying  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of Hershey Foods Corporation and its
       subsidiaries (the "Corporation") after elimination of intercompany  accounts and transactions.  These statements have been
       prepared  in  accordance  with the  instructions  to Form 10-Q and do not  include all of the  information  and  footnotes
       required by accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States for complete  financial  statements.  In the
       opinion of management,  all adjustments  (consisting only of normal recurring  accruals)  considered  necessary for a fair
       presentation  have been included.  Operating  results for the nine months ended  September 29, 2002,  are not  necessarily
       indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2002,  because of the seasonal  effects of
       the Corporation's  business.  For more information,  refer to the consolidated  financial statements and notes included in
       the Corporation's 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
<BR><BR>
       Certain  reclassifications  have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the 2002  presentation.  In accordance with
       final  consensuses  reached on various EITF Issues  regarding the reporting of certain sales  incentives,  costs  totaling
       $126.1  million  and  $301.0  million  for the three  months and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001,  respectively,
       previously  reported in selling,  marketing  and  administrative  expense,  have been  reclassified  as a reduction to net
       sales. In addition,  certain freight  billings  totaling $.8 million and $1.9 million for the three months and nine months
       ended  September 30, 2001,  respectively,  previously  reported in cost of sales have been  reclassified as an increase to
       net sales.

<B> <LI>   BUSINESS REALIGNMENT INITIATIVES</B>
<BR><BR>
       In late October 2001, the  Corporation's  Board of Directors  approved a plan to improve the efficiency and  profitability
       of the Corporation's  operations.  The plan included asset management improvements,  product line rationalization,  supply
       chain efficiency  improvements,  and a voluntary work force reduction  program  (collectively,  "the business  realignment
       initiatives").  The major  components  of the plan  will be  completed  by the end of 2002.  For more  information  on the
       business realignment  initiatives  recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, refer to the consolidated  financial statements
       and notes included in the Corporation's 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
<BR><BR>
       During  the  first six  months of 2002,  a charge to cost of sales and net  business  realignment  charges  were  recorded
       totaling  $11.5 million  before tax ($7.3 million  after-tax or $.05 per  share-diluted).  The total  included a charge to
       cost of sales of $.8 million  associated  with the relocation of  manufacturing  equipment and a net business  realignment
       charge of $10.7  million.  Components  of the net $10.7  million  pre-tax  charge for these  initiatives  included a $14.9
       million charge relating to pension  settlement costs associated with the voluntary work force reduction  program ("VWRP"),
       a $.1  million  charge  relating  to product  line  rationalization,  and a $.1 million  charge  relating to supply  chain
       efficiency  improvements,  partially  offset by a $4.4  million  favorable  adjustment  relating to the sale of a group of
       Hershey's  non-chocolate  confectionery  candy brands to Farley's and Sathers  Candy  Company,  Inc.  (the  "Farley's  and
       Sathers sale") for $12.0 million in cash.
<BR><BR>
       During the third quarter of 2002, a charge to cost of sales and business  realignment  charges were recorded  totaling $9.1
       million  before tax ($5.8 million  after-tax or $.04 per  share-diluted).  The total  included a charge to cost of sales of
       $.6 million  associated with the relocation of manufacturing  equipment and a business  realignment  charge of $8.5 million
       relating to pension settlement costs associated with the VWRP.
<BR><BR>
       Additional  charges  totaling  approximately  $15.0  million to $25.0 million  before tax, are expected to be recorded,  as
       incurred,  in the fourth quarter of 2002,  primarily related to additional pension settlement costs resulting from the VWRP
       and expenses  associated  with the relocation of  manufacturing  equipment.  Pension  settlement  costs will vary depending
       upon  pension  cost  factors,  such as  actuarial  assumptions,  returns on pension  plan  assets and  employee  retirement
       decisions.  Total costs  associated  with the business  realignment  initiatives  are expected to be in the range of $310.0
       million, as announced in January 2002, to $320.0 million.

<I>&#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.
142&#148;)<I> </I>as of January 1, 2002<I>.</I> The reassessment of the useful
lives of intangible assets acquired on or before June 30, 2001 was completed
during the first quarter of 2002. Amortization of goodwill resulting from
business acquisitions of $388.7 million was discontinued as of January 1, 2002.
Other intangible assets totaling $40.4 million as of January 1, 2002 primarily
consisted of trademarks and patents obtained through business acquisitions. The
useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and, therefore,
amortization of these assets was discontinued as of January 1, 2002. Patents
valued at a total of $9.0 million are being amortized over their remaining legal
lives of approximately eighteen years.

<BR><BR>


Goodwill
was assigned to reporting units and transitional impairment tests were performed
for goodwill and other intangible assets during the first quarter of 2002. No
impairment of assets was determined as a result of these tests. A reconciliation
of reported net income to net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the
discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2001 is as follows:</FONT>

Reclassification
adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to income, for gains or
losses on cash flow hedging derivatives, were reflected in cost of sales.
Pre-tax losses on cash flow hedging derivatives recognized in cost of sales as a
result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately $.7 million for the three
months September 29, 2002, with pre-tax gains of approximately $.4 million
recognized for the nine months ended September 29, 2002. Pre-tax net gains on
cash flow hedging derivatives recognized in cost of sales as a result of hedge
ineffectiveness were approximately $1.0 million and $.8 million for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2001, respectively. No gains or
losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) into income as a result of the discontinuance of a
hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not
occur. There were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging
derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

As
of September 29, 2002, the amount of net after-tax gains on cash flow hedging
derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap

earnings in the next twelve months were approximately $54.0 million, compared to
net after-tax losses on cash flow hedging derivatives to be reclassified into
earnings in the next twelve months of $6.3 million as of September 30, 2001.

The
increase in raw material inventories as of September 29, 2002, reflected the
seasonal timing of deliveries to support manufacturing requirements. Raw
material inventories were $196.0 million as of September 29, 2002 compared to
$284.8 million as of September 30, 2001, reflecting the impact of the
Corporation&#146;s business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth
quarter of 2001.
<BR><BR>

<B><LI>   LONG-TERM DEBT</B>
<BR><BR>

In
August 1997, the Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement under which
it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $500 million of
additional debt securities. As of September 29, 2002, $250 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration
Statement.</FONT>
<BR><BR>

<hr size=2 noshade>
<BR><BR>

<font size=3>
<B><LI>  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</B>
<BR><BR>
The
carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximated fair
value as of September 29, 2002 and December 31, 2001, because of the relatively
short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt,
including the current portion, was $868.8 million as of September 29, 2002,
compared to a fair value of $1,017.0 million, based on quoted market prices for
the same or similar debt issues.
<BR><BR>

As
of September 29, 2002, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward contracts
maturing in 2002, 2003 and 2004 to purchase $53.0 million in foreign currency,
primarily British sterling and euros, and to sell $23.8 million in foreign
currency, primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.

<BR><BR>

The
fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by obtaining
quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for
maturity differences. As of September 29, 2002, the fair value of foreign
exchange forward contracts approximated the contract value. The Corporation does
not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

<BR><br>

In
order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, the
Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. In
February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements that
effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental payments on certain
operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%. Any interest rate
differential on interest rate swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to
interest expense over the term of each agreement. The fair value of interest
rate swap agreements was a liability of $8.0 million and $2.7 million as of
September 29, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. The Corporation&#146;s
risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of
replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates.

<BR><BR>

<B><LI>  SHARE REPURCHASES</B>
<BR><BR>

In
October 1999, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors approved a share
repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of the
Corporation&#146;s Common Stock. Under this program, a total of 2,388,586 shares
of Common Stock was purchased through September 29, 2002. As of September 29,
2002, a total of 43,580,410 shares were held as Treasury Stock and $84.2 million
remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under the repurchase program.

<BR><BR>

<B><LI>  OTHER MATTERS</B>
<BR><BR>
On
July 25, 2002, the Corporation confirmed that the Milton Hershey School Trust,
which controls 77% of the combined voting power of the Corporation&#146;s Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock, had informed the Corporation that it had decided
to diversify its holdings and in this regard wanted Hershey Foods to explore a
sale of the entire Corporation. On September 17, 2002, the Milton Hershey School
Trust instructed the Corporation to terminate the sale process. Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses for the three months and nine months ended
September 29, 2002, included expenses of approximately $17.3 million associated
with the exploration of the sale of the Corporation.</FONT>

<P><font size=3><B>Item 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition</B></P>

<B><U>Results of Operations - Third Quarter 2002 vs. Third Quarter 2001</U></B></font>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Consolidated net sales for
the third quarter decreased from $1,178.9 million in 2001 to $1,152.3 million in
2002. The decrease from the prior year was a result of higher promotional
allowances, returns, discounts, and allowances as well as the rationalization of
certain under-performing brands, including the divestiture of <I>Heide</I>
brands in May 2002, the discontinuance and subsequent licensing of the
Corporation&#146;s aseptically packaged drink products in the United States, and
the divestiture of the <I>Luden&#146;s</I> throat drop business in September
2001. Sluggishness in several international markets, specifically Canada and
Brazil, also contributed to the lower sales in the quarter. These factors which
resulted in lower sales were partially offset by increased sales of key
confectionery brands in the United States, including new products and line
extensions, and selected confectionery selling price increases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The consolidated gross
margin increased from 36.1% in 2001 to 37.8% in 2002. The increase reflected
decreased costs for certain major raw materials, primarily cocoa and peanuts,
and packaging materials, a more profitable sales mix and selected confectionery
selling price increases. The impact of these items was partially offset by
higher promotional spending, and returns, discounts, and allowances, which were
higher as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Selling, marketing and
administrative expenses increased by 1% in 2002, primarily reflecting the impact
of $17.3 million of expenses related to the exploration of the sale of the
Corporation. Excluding the impact of these expenses in 2002 and goodwill
amortization in 2001, selling, marketing and administrative costs were 6% lower
in 2002. The reduction was due primarily to lower marketing spending as well as
lower salary expense associated with reduced staffing resulting from the
Corporation&#146;s voluntary work force reduction program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net interest expense in the
third quarter of 2002 was $4.0 million less than the comparable period of 2001,
primarily reflecting a decrease in short-term interest expense due to reduced
average short-term borrowings and lower average short-term borrowing rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net income for the third
quarter increased $2.3 million, or 2%, from 2001 to 2002, and net income per
share - diluted increased $.01, or 1%. Excluding the after-tax effect of the
business realignment initiatives and expenses related to the exploration of sale
recorded in 2002, as well as the after-tax effect of goodwill amortization and
the gain on the sale of the Luden&#146;s business in 2001, net income for the
third quarter increased $16.5 million, or 13%, from 2001 to 2002, and net income
per share - diluted increased $.11, or 12%. </FONT></P>

<p><FONT SIZE=3><B><U>Results of
Operations - First Nine Months 2002 vs. First Nine Months 2001</U></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Consolidated net sales for
the first nine months decreased from $2,984.2 million in 2001 to $2,964.3
million in 2002. The sales decrease primarily reflected higher promotion
allowances and returns, discounts, and allowances, the rationalization of
certain under-performing brands, including the divestitures of the <I>Heide</I>
brands in May 2002 and the <I>Luden&#146;s</I> throat drop business in September
2001, and the timing of the acquisition of the Nabisco Inc. gum and mint
business which resulted in incremental sales in the first nine months of 2001
compared to the same period of 2002. These decreases were partially offset by
increases in sales of key confectionery brands in the United States, including
new products and line extensions, and selected confectionery selling price
increases, as well as incremental sales from Visagis, the Brazilian chocolate
and confectionery business acquired in July 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The consolidated gross
margin increased from 36.0% in 2001 to 37.5% in 2002. The increase in gross
margin primarily reflected decreased costs for certain major raw materials,
primarily cocoa, milk, and peanuts, and packaging materials, higher
profitability resulting from the mix of confectionery items sold in 2002
compared with sales in 2001 and selected confectionery selling price increases.
These increases in gross margin were partially offset by higher promotion
allowances and returns, discounts, and allowances, both of which were higher as
a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Selling, marketing and
administrative expenses decreased by 1% in 2002, primarily as a result of
savings from the business realignment initiatives and the elimination of
goodwill amortization in 2002, offset by $17.3 million of expenses incurred to
explore the sale of the Corporation. Excluding the impact of goodwill
amortization in 2001 and the expenses incurred to explore the Corporation&#146;s
sale, selling, marketing, and administrative expenses in 2002 were 2% lower than
2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net interest expense in the
first nine months of 2002 was $6.9 million less than the comparable period of
2001, primarily reflecting a decrease in short-term interest expense due to
reduced average short-term borrowings and lower average short-term borrowing
rates. </FONT></P>
<BR><BR>
<p align=center><font size=2>-13-</font></p>
<hr size=2 noshade>
<BR><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net income for the first
nine months of 2002 was $273.3 million compared to $252.1 million in 2001 and
net income per share-diluted was $1.98 per share compared to $1.83 per share in
the prior year. Excluding the after-tax effect of the business realignment
initiatives and costs related to the exploration of the sale of the Corporation
recorded in 2002, as well as the after-tax effect of goodwill amortization and
the gain on the sale of the Luden&#146;s business in 2001, net income for the
first nine months increased $36.3 million, or 14%, from 2001 to 2002 and net
income per share - diluted increased $.26, or 14%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B><U>Business Realignment Initiatives</U></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In late October 2001, the
Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors approved a plan to improve the efficiency
and profitability of the Corporation&#146;s operations. The plan included asset
management improvements, product line rationalization, supply chain efficiency
improvements and a voluntary work force reduction program (&#147;VWRP&#148;). As
of September 29, 2002, the total estimated costs for the business realignment
initiatives are expected to be in a range of $310.0 million, as announced in
January 2002, to $320.0 million, as higher pension settlement costs associated
with the VWRP which are recorded as incurred, are expected to more than offset
the impact of the greater than expected proceeds from the sale of certain
assets. A favorable adjustment of $4.4 million resulting from the greater than
expected proceeds was recorded during the second quarter and included in the net
business realignment charge. As of September 29, 2002, there have been no
significant changes to the estimated savings for the business realignment
initiatives. The major components of these initiatives remain on schedule for
completion by the end of 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Asset management
improvements included the decision to outsource the manufacture of certain
ingredients and the related removal and disposal of machinery and equipment
related to the manufacture of these ingredients. As a result of this
outsourcing, the Corporation was able to significantly reduce raw material
inventories, primarily cocoa beans and cocoa butter, in the fourth quarter of
2001. The remaining portion of the project was substantially completed during
the first quarter of 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Product line
rationalization plans included the sale or exit of certain businesses, the
discontinuance of certain non-chocolate confectionery products and the
realignment of the Corporation&#146;s sales organizations. Costs associated with
the realignment of the sales organizations related primarily to sales office
closings and terminating the use of certain sales brokers. During the first nine
months of 2002, sales offices were closed as planned and the use of certain
sales brokers was discontinued. During the second quarter, the sale of a group
of Hershey&#146;s non-chocolate confectionery candy brands to Farley&#146;s
&amp; Sathers Candy Company, Inc. was completed. Included in the transaction
were the HEIDE<SUP>&#174;</SUP>, JUJYFRUITS<SUP>&#174;</SUP>,
WUNDERBEANS<SUP>&#174;</SUP> and AMAZIN&#146; FRUIT<SUP>&#174; </SUP>trademarked
confectionery brands, as well as the rights to sell CHUCKLES<SUP>&#174;</SUP>
branded products, under license. Also, during the second quarter the Corporation
discontinued and subsequently licensed the sale of its aseptically packaged
drink products in the United States. Sales associated with these brands during
the first six months and third quarter of 2002 are included in Note 2. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>To improve supply chain
efficiency and profitability, three manufacturing facilities, a distribution
center and certain other facilities were planned to be closed. These included
manufacturing facilities in Denver, Colorado; Pennsburg, Pennsylvania; and
Palmyra, Pennsylvania and a distribution center and certain minor facilities
located in Oakdale, California. During the first quarter of 2002, the
manufacturing facility in Palmyra, Pennsylvania was closed and additional costs
were recorded, as incurred, relating to retention payments. In addition, asset
disposals relating to the closure of the three manufacturing plants were begun.
During the second quarter, operations utilizing the distribution center in
Oakdale, California ceased. Asset write-offs relating to the closure of the
three manufacturing plants continued during the third quarter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In October 2001, the
Corporation offered the VWRP to certain eligible employees in the United States,
Canada and Puerto Rico in order to reduce staffing levels and improve
profitability. The VWRP consisted of an early retirement program which provided
enhanced pension, post-retirement and certain supplemental benefits and an
enhanced mutual separation program which provided increased severance and
temporary medical benefits. A reduction of approximately 500 employees occurred
during the first nine months of 2002 as a result of the VWRP. Additional pension
settlement costs of $8.6 million, $6.4 million and $8.5 million before tax were
recorded in the first, second and third quarters, respectively, of 2002,
principally associated with lump sum payments of pension benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B><U>Liquidity and Capital Resources</U></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Historically, the
Corporation&#146;s major source of financing has been cash generated from
operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which typically peak during
the summer months, generally have been met by issuing commercial paper. During
the first nine months of 2002, the Corporation&#146;s cash and cash equivalents
decreased by $14.3 million. Also</font>

<hr size=2 noshade>
<BR><BR>

<font size=3>
during the period, the Corporation contributed
$129.7 million to its domestic pension plans. Cash provided from operations,
cash on hand at the beginning of the period and proceeds from a business
divestiture was substantially sufficient to fund dividend payments of $124.8
million and $74.5 million of capital expenditures. Cash provided from other
assets and liabilities of $137.0 million, primarily reflected commodities
transactions and an increase in accrued income taxes, partially offset by
contributions to the Corporation&#146;s domestic pension plans and decreases in
accrued liabilities. Cash provided from other assets and liabilities in 2001 of
$163.2 million was principally the result of commodities transactions and an
increase in accrued income taxes , partially offset by a pension plan
contribution. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In order to improve the
funded status of the Corporation&#146;s domestic pension plans, a contribution
of $75.0 million was made in February 2001. Additional contributions of $95.0
million, $75.0 million and $54.7 million were made in December 2001 and in March
and June 2002, respectively, to fund payments related to the early retirement
program and to improve the funded status. These contributions were funded by
cash from operations. Depending upon the market performance of pension plan
assets, the Corporation anticipates additional contributions of $75.0 million to
$100.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The ratio of current assets
to current liabilities was 2.4:1 as of September 29, 2002, and 1.9:1 as of
December&#160;31, 2001. The Corporation&#146;s capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders&#146; equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 39% as of September 29, 2002, and 44% as of
December 31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B><U>Other Matters</U></B></FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>On July 25, 2002, the
Corporation confirmed that the Milton Hershey School Trust, which controls 77%
of the combined voting power of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock, had informed the Corporation that it had decided to diversify its
holdings and in this regard wanted Hershey Foods to explore a sale of the entire
Corporation. On September 17, 2002, the Milton Hershey School Trust instructed
the Corporation to terminate the sale process. </FONT></P>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The potential loss in fair
value of foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements
resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of ten
percent increased from $.3 million as of December 31, 2001, to $.5 million as of
September 29, 2002. The market risk resulting from a hypothetical adverse market
price movement of ten percent associated with the estimated average fair value
of net commodity positions decreased from $4.7 million as of December 31, 2001,
to $1.1 million as of September 29, 2002. Market risk represents 10% of the
estimated average fair value of net commodity positions at four dates prior to
the end of each period. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Item 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controls and Procedures</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), within
the 90 days prior to the filing date of this report, the Corporation conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Corporation&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was
carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the
Corporation&#146;s management, including the Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Corporation&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have
been no significant changes in the Corporation&#146;s internal controls or in
other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to
the date of the evaluation. </FONT></P>

Commission&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Corporation&#146;s reports filed under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. </FONT></P>

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                           KEY EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN

                  (Amended and Restated as of August 19, 2002)

1.   ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

     Hershey Foods Corporation (the "Corporation") hereby establishes the Key
     Employee Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to provide
     to selected key employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries (as
     defined below), upon whose efforts the Corporation is dependent for the
     successful conduct of its business, further incentive to continue and
     increase their efforts as employees and to remain in the employ of the
     Corporation and its subsidiaries.

     The Plan continues the Annual Incentive Program ("AIP"), with certain
     modifications, as in effect under the Corporation's Management Incentive
     Plan ("MIP") established in 1975 and as amended thereafter, pursuant to
     which participants are entitled to receive cash awards based on achievement
     of performance goals during annual performance cycles. The Plan also
     continues the Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP") portion of the MIP with
     certain modifications. In addition to performance stock units ("Performance
     Stock Units"), the LTIP portion also includes nonqualified stock options
     for the purchase of Common Stock ("Options"); stock appreciation rights
     ("SARs"); and restricted stock units ("Restricted Stock Units").

     As used herein, (i) the term "Subsidiary Corporation" shall mean any
     present or future corporation which is or would be a "subsidiary
     corporation" of the Corporation as defined in Section 424 of the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and (ii) the term "Corporation" defined
     above shall refer collectively to Hershey Foods Corporation and its
     Subsidiary Corporations unless the context indicates otherwise.

2.   STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

     The aggregate number of shares of the Corporation's common stock, $1.00 par
     value per share (the "Common Stock") that may be issued under the Plan
     pursuant to awards granted wholly or partly in Common Stock (including
     rights or options which may be exercised for or settled in Common Stock) is
     19,000,000 (inclusive of shares that are the subject of awards outstanding
     as of February 13, 2002 and shares issued pursuant to awards under this
     Plan prior to such date). The shares of Common Stock issued under this Plan
     may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares held by the
     Corporation or any direct or indirect subsidiary thereof, or shares
     acquired by the Corporation through open market purchases or otherwise. The
     number of shares of Common Stock that are the subject of any awards
     outstanding on or after February 13, 2002 that are forfeited or terminated,
     surrendered, expire unexercised, are settled in cash in lieu of Common
     Stock or are exercised or settled in a manner such that some or all of the
     shares covered by the award are not issued or are exchanged for awards that
     do not involve Common Stock, shall again

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

     immediately  become  available  for  issuance  as  awards  hereunder.   The
     Committee  may  from  time  to  time  adopt  and  observe  such  procedures
     concerning  the counting of shares  against the Plan maximum as it may deem
     appropriate.

3.   ADMINISTRATION

     The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation and Executive
     Organization Committee (the "Committee"), or any successor committee,
     appointed by and consisting solely of members of the Board of Directors
     (the "Board") of the Corporation, each of whom qualifies as both a
     "nonemployee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 or its successor
     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and an
     "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
     Committee members shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan. The
     Board may from time to time remove and appoint members of the Committee in
     substitution for, or in addition to, members previously appointed and may
     fill vacancies, however caused, in the Committee. The Committee may adopt
     such rules and regulations as it deems useful in governing its affairs. To
     the extent provided by resolution of the Board, the Committee may authorize
     the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and other senior officers of
     the Corporation to designate officers and employees to be recipients of
     awards, to determine the terms, conditions, form and amount of any such
     awards, and to take such other actions which the Committee is authorized to
     take under this Plan, provided that the Committee may not delegate to any
     person the authority to grant awards to, or take other action with respect
     to, participants who at the time of such awards or action are subject to
     Section 16 of the Exchange Act or are "covered employees" as defined in
     Section 162(m) of the Code. Any action of the Committee with respect to the
     administration of the Plan shall be taken by majority vote at a Committee
     meeting or written consent of all Committee members.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee shall have
     authority: (i) to construe and interpret Plan provisions; (ii) to define
     the terms used in the Plan; (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
     regulations relating to the Plan; (iv) to select particular employees to
     participate in the Plan; (v) to determine the terms, conditions, form and
     amount of grants, distributions or payments made to each participant,
     including conditions upon and provisions for vesting, exercise and
     acceleration of any grants, distributions or payments; (vi) upon the
     request of a participant in the Plan, to approve and determine the duration
     of leaves of absence which may be granted to the participant without
     constituting a termination of his or her employment for purposes of the
     Plan; and (vii) to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for
     the administration and operation of the Plan. The Committee shall have the
     right to impose varying terms and conditions with respect to each grant or
     award. All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee shall
     be final, binding and conclusive on all participants and on their legal
     representatives and beneficiaries.

4.   FAIR MARKET VALUE

     As used in the Plan (unless a different method of calculation is required
     by applicable law, and except as otherwise specifically provided in any
     Plan provision), "Fair Market Value"

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

     on or as of any date shall mean (i) the closing  price of the Common  Stock
     as reported in the New York Stock Exchange  Composite  Transactions  Report
     (or any other consolidated transactions reporting system which subsequently
     may  replace  such  Composite  Transactions  Report) for the New York Stock
     Exchange  trading day  immediately  preceding such date, or if there are no
     sales on such date, on the next preceding day on which there were sales, or
     (ii) in the event that the Common Stock is no longer  listed for trading on
     the New York  Stock  Exchange,  an amount  determined  in  accordance  with
     standards adopted by the Committee.

5.   ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

     Key employees of the Corporation or of any of its Subsidiary Corporations,
     including officers and directors who are regular employees but not members
     of the Committee, who in the opinion of the Committee are in a position to
     contribute significantly to the success of the Corporation or any
     Subsidiary Corporation, division or operating unit thereof, shall be
     eligible for selection to participate in the Plan. In making this selection
     and in determining the form and amount of grants, distributions and
     payments under the Plan, the Committee shall take into account the duties
     of the respective employees, their present and potential contributions to
     the success of the Corporation or any Subsidiary Corporation, division or
     operating unit thereof, and such other factors as the Committee may deem
     relevant in connection with accomplishing the purposes of the Plan. An
     employee who has been selected to participate may, if he or she is
     otherwise eligible, receive more than one grant from time to time, and may
     be granted any combination of contingent target grants under the AIP or
     under the LTIP components of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine.

6.   ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM

     The Committee may from time to time, subject to the provisions of the Plan
     and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine,
     establish contingent target grants for those eligible employees it selects
     to participate in the AIP. Each such contingent grant may be, but need not
     be, evidenced by a written instrument, and shall be determined in relation
     to the participant's level of responsibility in the Corporation and the
     competitive compensation practices of other major businesses, and such
     other factors as are deemed appropriate by the Committee.

     (a) Awards actually earned by and paid to AIP participants ("AIP Awards")
         will be based primarily upon achievement of Performance Goals (as
         defined in Section 9 below) over a one-year performance cycle as
         approved by the Committee.

     (b) The Committee, within the limits of the Plan, shall have full authority
         and discretion to determine the time or times of establishing
         contingent target grants; to select from among those eligible the
         employees to receive awards; to review and certify the achievement of
         Performance Goals; to designate levels of awards to be earned in
         relation to levels of achievement of Performance Goals; to adopt such
         financial and nonfinancial performance or other criteria for the
         payment of awards as it may

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         determine  from time to time;  to make awards;  and to establish  such
         other  measures as may be necessary to achieve the  objectives  of the
         Plan. The financial or  non-financial  Performance  Goals  established
         by the Committee may be based upon one or more Performance  Factors (as
         defined in Section 9 below).

     (c) The maximum amount any participant can receive as an AIP Award for any
         calendar year shall not exceed $3,000,000.

     (d) AIP Awards as earned under the terms of the Plan shall be paid in cash
         and may exceed or be less than the contingent target grants, subject
         nevertheless to the maximum award limit set forth in subparagraph (c)
         above. Payment shall normally be made as soon as possible following the
         close of the year, but payment of all or any portion may be deferred by
         participants with the approval of the Committee.

7.   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM

     The LTIP consists of the following four components:

     I.  Performance Stock Units

         The Committee may, subject to the provisions of the Plan and such other
         terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, grant Performance
         Stock Units to reflect the value of contingent target grants
         established for each eligible employee selected for participation. Each
         grant of Performance Stock Units may be, but need not be, evidenced by
         a written instrument. Such contingent target grants shall be determined
         in relation to the employee's level of responsibility in the
         Corporation or any Subsidiary Corporation, division or operating unit
         thereof, and the competitive compensation practices of other major
         businesses.

         (a)  Awards actually earned by and paid to holders of Performance Stock
              Units ("PSU Awards") will be based upon achievement of Performance
              Goals over performance cycles as approved by the Committee. Such
              performance cycles each shall cover such period of time, not
              exceeding five years, as the Committee from time to time shall
              determine.

         (b)  The Committee, within the limits of the Plan, shall have full
              authority and discretion to determine the time or times of
              establishing contingent target grants and the granting of
              Performance Stock Units; to select from among those eligible the
              employees to receive PSU Awards; to review and certify the
              achievement of Performance Goals; to designate levels of awards to
              be earned in relation to levels of achievement of Performance
              Goals; to adopt such financial and nonfinancial performance or
              other criteria for the payment of PSU Awards as it may determine
              from time to time; to make awards; and to establish such other
              measures as may be necessary to the objectives of the Plan. The
              Performance Goals established by the Committee may be based on one
              or more of the Performance Factors.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

         (c)  Payments  of PSU  Awards  shall be made in  shares of Common
              Stock or partly in cash as the  Committee in its sole  discretion
              shall determine and shall be charged against the shares available
              under the LTIP  portion of the Plan as provided in  Paragraph  2;
              provided,  however, that no fractional shares shall be issued and
              any such fraction will be eliminated by rounding  downward to the
              nearest whole share.

         (d)  PSU Awards as earned under the terms of the Plan may exceed or be
              less than the contingent target grants. Payment shall normally be
              made as soon as possible following the close of the year, but
              payment of all or any portion may be deferred by participants with
              the approval of the Committee.

         (e) The maximum number of PSUs a participant can receive as a PSU Award
             in any calendar year is 75,000.

     II. Stock Options

         The Committee may, from time to time, subject to the provisions of the
         Plan and such other terms and conditions as it may determine, grant
         nonqualified Options to purchase shares of Common Stock of the
         Corporation to employees eligible to participate in the Plan. Each
         grant of an Option shall be on such terms and conditions and be in such
         form as the Committee may from time to time approve, subject to the
         following:

         (a)  The exercise price per share with respect to each Option shall be
              determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, but shall not
              be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as
              of the date of the grant of the Option.

         (b)  Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable, in such
              installments and for such periods, as shall be provided by the
              Committee at the time of granting, but in no event shall any
              Option granted extend for a period in excess of ten years from the
              date of grant.

         (c)  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock covered by Options
              granted to a participant for any calendar year shall not exceed
              500,000.

         (d)  Among other conditions that may be imposed by the Committee, if
              deemed appropriate, are those relating to (i) the period or
              periods and the conditions of exercisability of any Option; (ii)
              the minimum periods during which grantees of Options must be
              employed, or must hold Options before they may be exercised; (iii)
              the minimum periods during which shares acquired upon exercise
              must be held before sale or transfer shall be permitted; (iv)
              conditions under which such Options or shares may be subject to
              forfeiture; and (v) the frequency of exercise or the minimum or
              maximum number of shares that may be acquired at any one time.

         (e)  Exercise of an Option shall be by written notice stating the
              election to exercise in the form and manner determined by the
              Committee.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>


         (f)  The purchase price upon exercise of any Option shall be paid in
              full by making payment (i) in cash; (ii) in whole or in part by
              the delivery of a certificate or certificates of shares of
              previously-acquired Common Stock of the Corporation, valued at its
              then Fair Market Value; or (iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii).

         (g)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (f) above, any optionee may make
              payment of the Option price through a simultaneous exercise of his
              or her Option and sale of the shares thereby acquired pursuant to
              a brokerage arrangement approved in advance by the Committee to
              assure its conformity with the terms and conditions of the Plan.

         (h)  The Committee may require the surrender of outstanding Options as
              a condition to the grant of new Options.

         (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or of any Option
              agreement between the Corporation and an employee, upon the
              occurrence of a Change in Control, each outstanding Option held by
              a participant who is an employee of the Corporation or any
              Subsidiary Corporation or who retired while employed by the
              Corporation or any Subsidiary Corporation shall become fully
              vested and exercisable notwithstanding any vesting schedule or
              installment schedule relating to the exercisability of such Option
              contained in the applicable Option agreement or otherwise
              established at the time of grant of the Option.

         (j)  For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" means:

              (1) Individuals who, on June 8, 1999, constitute the Board (the
                  "Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason to constitute at
                  least a majority of the Board, provided that any person
                  becoming a director subsequent to June 8, 1999, whose election
                  or nomination for election was approved by a vote of at least
                  two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors then on the Board
                  (either by specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement
                  of the Corporation in which such person is named as nominee
                  for director, without written objection to such nomination)
                  shall be an Incumbent Director; provided, however, that no
                  individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the
                  Corporation as a result of an actual or threatened election
                  contest (as described in Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange Act)
                  ("Election Contest") or other actual or threatened
                  solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of any
                  person (as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the
                  Exchange Act and as used in Section 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of
                  the Exchange Act) ("Person") other than the Board ("Proxy
                  Contest"), including by reason of any agreement intended to
                  avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest, shall
                  be deemed an Incumbent Director; and provided further,
                  however, that a director who has been approved by the Hershey
                  Trust while it beneficially owns more than 50% of the combined
                  voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the
                  Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
                  directors (the "Outstanding Corporation Voting Power") shall
                  be deemed to be an Incumbent Director; or

                  ownership  (within  the  meaning of Section  13(d) under the
                  Exchange  Act  and the  rules  and  regulations  promulgated
                  thereunder) of shares of the Common Stock and/or the Class B
                  Common Stock of the Corporation  representing 25% or more of
                  either (i) the total  number of then  outstanding  shares of
                  both  Common   Stock  and  Class  B  Common   Stock  of  the
                  Corporation (the  "Outstanding  Corporation  Stock") or (ii)
                  the Outstanding  Corporation Voting Power; provided that, at

                  beneficially   own  more   than   50%  of  the   Outstanding
                  Corporation  Voting Power; and provided,  further,  that any
                  such  acquisition  or holding  of  beneficial  ownership  of
                  shares of either Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the
                  Corporation  by any of the following  entities  shall not by
                  itself  constitute such a Change in Control  hereunder:  (i)
                  the  Hershey  Trust;  (ii)  any  trust  established  by  the
                  Corporation or by any Subsidiary Corporation for the benefit

                  of a Subsidiary Corporation; (iii) any employee benefit plan
                  (or  related   trust)   sponsored  or   maintained   by  the

                  merger, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or
                  other form of business combination (a "Business Combination")
                  if, following consummation of such Business Combination, the
                  Hershey Trust does not beneficially own more than 50% of the
                  total voting power of all outstanding voting securities of (x)

                  voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Surviving
                  Corporation; or

              (4) The approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of (i) any
                  sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the

                  ownership of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the
                  then outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors
                  of the Acquiring Corporation, or (ii) a liquidation or
                  dissolution of the Company.

         SARs may, but need not be evidenced by an

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

         agreement  executed by the  Corporation  and the holder,  and shall be
         subject to such terms and conditions  consistent  with the Plan as the
         Committee shall impose from time to time, including the following:

         (a)  SARs may, but need not, relate to Options granted under the Plan,
              as the Committee shall determine from time to time. In no event
              shall any SARs granted extend for a period in excess of ten years
              from the date of grant.

         (b)  A holder shall exercise his or her SARs by giving written notice
              of such exercise in the form and manner determined by the
              Committee, and the date upon which such written notice is received
              by the Corporation shall be the exercise date for the SARs.

         (c)  A holder of SARs shall be entitled to receive upon exercise the
              excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the
              time of exercise over the Fair Market Value of a share at the time
              the SARs were granted, multiplied by the number of shares with
              respect to which the SARs relate.

         (d)  In the sole discretion of the Committee, the amount payable to the
              holder upon exercise of SARs may be paid either in Common Stock or
              in cash or in a combination thereof. To the extent paid in Common
              Stock, the value of the Common Stock that shall be distributed
              shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock upon
              exercise of the SARs as provided in Paragraph 2; provided,
              however, that no fractional shares shall be issued and any such
              fraction will be eliminated by rounding downward to the nearest
              whole share.

         (e)  In the sole discretion of the Committee, SARs related to specific
              Options may be exercisable only upon surrender of all or a portion
              of the related Option, or may be exercisable, in whole or in part,
              only at such times and to the extent that the related Option is
              exercisable, and the number of shares purchasable pursuant to the
              related Option may be reduced to the extent of the number of
              shares with respect to which the SARs are exercised.

         (f)  In lieu of receiving payment at the time of exercise of SARs,
              payment of all or any portion may be deferred by the participant
              with the approval of the Committee.

         (g) The maximum number of SARs granted to a participant during any
             calendar year shall not exceed 500,000.

     IV. Restricted Stock Units

         The Committee may, from time to time, subject to the provisions of the
         Plan and such other terms and conditions as it may determine, grant
         Restricted Stock Units to employees eligible to participate in the
         Plan. Each grant of Restricted Stock Units may be, but need not be
         evidenced by a written instrument. The grant of Restricted Stock Units
         shall state the number of Restricted Stock Units covered by the grant,
         and shall

                                     -9-
<PAGE>


         contain such terms and conditions and be in such form as the
         Committee may from time to time approve, subject to the following:

         (a) Each Restricted Stock Unit shall be equivalent in value to a share
             of Common Stock.

         (b)  Vesting of each grant of Restricted Stock Units shall require the
              holder to remain in the employment of the Corporation or a
              Subsidiary Corporation for a prescribed period (a "Restriction
              Period"). The Committee shall determine the Restriction Period or
              Periods which shall apply to the shares of Common Stock covered by
              each grant of Restricted Stock Units. Except as otherwise
              determined by the Committee and provided in the written instrument
              granting the Restricted Stock Units, and except as otherwise
              provided in Paragraph 8, all Restricted Stock Units granted to a
              participant under the Plan shall terminate upon termination of the
              participant's employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
              Corporation before the end of the Restriction Period or Periods
              applicable to such Restricted Stock Units, and in such event the
              holder shall not be entitled to receive any payment with respect
              to those Restricted Stock Units. The Committee may also, in its
              sole discretion, establish other terms and conditions for the
              vesting of Restricted Stock Units, including conditioning vesting
              on the achievement of one or more of the Performance Factors.
              Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or of any written
              instrument granting Restricted Stock Units, upon the occurrence of
              a Change in Control as defined in subparagraph (j) of Paragraph
              7II hereof, all restrictions on Restricted Stock Units held by a
              participant who is an employee of the Corporation or any
              Subsidiary Corporation shall lapse.

         (c)  Upon expiration of the Restriction Period or Periods applicable to
              each grant of Restricted Stock Units, the holder shall, without
              payment on his part, be entitled to receive payment in an amount
              equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common
              Stock covered by such grant upon such expiration. Such payment may
              be made in cash, in shares of Common Stock equal to the number of
              Restricted Stock Units with respect to which such payment is made,
              or in any combination thereof, as the Committee in its sole
              discretion shall determine. Further upon such expiration, the
              holder shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount
              equal to each cash dividend the Corporation would have paid to
              such holder during the term of those Restricted Stock Units as if
              the holder had been the owner of record of the shares of Common
              Stock covered by such Restricted Stock Units on the record date
              for the payment of such dividend.

         (d)  In lieu of receiving payment at the time of expiration of the
              Restriction Period or Periods, payment of all or any portion may
              be deferred by the participant with the approval of the Committee.

         (e)  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock as to which
              Restricted Stock Units may be granted to a participant for any
              calendar year shall not exceed 75,000.

8.   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     Upon termination of employment with the Corporation of any participant,
     such participant's rights with respect to any contingent target grants
     under the AIP, or any Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs or Restricted
     Stock Units granted under the LTIP, shall be as follows:

     (a) In the event that the participant is terminated or discharged by the
         Corporation for any reason, except as and to the extent provided
         otherwise by the Committee in writing and except as provided below
         after the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in subparagraph
         (j) of Paragraph 7II hereof), the participant's rights and interests
         under the Plan shall immediately terminate upon notice of termination
         of employment.

         Upon the occurrence of a Potential Change in Control (as defined in
         subparagraph (k) of Paragraph 7II hereof) and for a period of one (1)
         year thereafter, the following special provision and notice requirement
         shall be applicable in the event of the termination of the employment
         of any participant holding an Option under the Plan: (i) in no event
         may a notice of termination of employment be issued to such a
         participant unless at least ten (10) business days prior to the
         effective date of such termination, the participant is provided with a
         written notice of intent to terminate the participant's employment
         which sets forth in reasonable detail the reason for such intent to
         terminate, the date on which such termination is to be effective, and a
         description of the participant's rights under this Plan and under the
         agreements granting such Option or Options, including the fact that no
         such Option may be exercised after such termination has become
         effective and the manner, extent and price at which all Options then
         held by such participant may be exercised; and (ii) such notice of
         intent to terminate a participant's employment shall not be considered
         a "notice of termination of employment" for purposes of the first
         sentence of this Paragraph 8(a). This Paragraph 8(a) is intended only
         to provide for a requirement of notice to terminate upon the occurrence
         of the events set forth herein and shall not be construed to create an
         obligation of continued employment or a contract of employment in any
         manner or to otherwise affect or limit the Corporation's ability to
         terminate the employment of any participant holding an Option under the
         Plan.

         Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control and for a period of two (2)
         years thereafter, in the event of the termination of a participant's
         employment by the Corporation for any reason other than for Cause (as
         defined below) or by the participant for Good Reason (as defined
         below), such participant shall have one (1) year from the date of
         termination of employment to exercise such Option or until the date of
         expiration of the Option, if earlier. In addition, all restrictions and
         limitations on the exercise of such Option or the sale of shares of
         Common Stock purchased pursuant to exercise of an Option relating to
         minimum stockholding requirements shall immediately terminate upon the
         occurrence of a Change in Control.

         For purposes of this Plan, "Cause" means, with respect to a participant
         who is covered under the Hershey Foods Corporation Employee Benefits
         Protection Plan (Group 2),

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

         the Hershey  Foods  Corporation  Executive  Benefits  Protection  Plan
         (Group  3),  or  the  Hershey  Foods  Corporation  Executive  Benefits
         Protection Plan (Group 3A),  "cause" as defined in the plan applicable
         to such participant, and with respect to all other participants, means
         (a) the willful and continued  failure of an employee to substantially
         perform the  employee's  duties with the  Corporation  (other than any
         such  failure  resulting  from  incapacity  due to  physical or mental
         illness),  after a  written  demand  for  substantial  performance  is
         delivered  to  the  employee  by  the  employee's   supervisor   which
         specifically  identifies the manner in which the employee's supervisor
         believes  that  the  employee  has  not  substantially  performed  the
         employee's  duties;  or (b) the willful  engaging  by the  employee in
         illegal   conduct  or  gross   misconduct   which  is  materially  and
         demonstrably  injurious  to  the  Corporation.  For  purposes  of  the
         preceding  clauses  (a) and (b), no act or failure to act, on the part
         of the employee,  shall be considered  "willful" unless it is done, or
         omitted to be done, by the employee in bad faith or without reasonable
         belief  that  the  employee's  action  or  omission  was in  the  best
         interests of the  Corporation.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon
         the  instructions  or with the  approval  of a senior  officer  of the
         Corporation  or the  employee's  superior  or based upon the advice of
         counsel for the Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be done,
         or omitted to be done,  by the  employee in good faith and in the best
         interests of the Corporation.

         For  purposes of this Plan,  "Good  Reason"  means,  with respect to a
         participant  who  is  covered  under  the  Hershey  Foods  Corporation
         Employee  Benefits  Protection  Plan  (Group  2),  the  Hershey  Foods
         Corporation  Executive  Benefits  Protection  Plan  (Group  3), or the
         Hershey Foods Corporation  Executive  Benefits  Protection Plan (Group
         3A),  "good  reason"  as  defined  in  the  plan  applicable  to  such
         participant,  and with respect to all other participants,  means "good
         reason"  as defined  in the  Hershey  Foods  Corporation  Amended  and
         Restated Severance Benefits Plan as in effect immediately prior to the
         Change in Control.

     (b) If a participant terminates employment with the Corporation as the
         result, in the sole judgment of the Committee, of his or her becoming
         totally disabled (in which event termination will be deemed to occur on
         the date the Committee makes such determination), or if a participant
         should die or (except as to Restricted Stock Units) retire while
         employed by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiary Corporations, then
         the participant or, as the case may be, the person or persons to whom
         the participant's interest under the Plan shall pass by will or by the
         laws of descent and distribution (the "Estate"), shall have the
         following rights:

         (i)  the grantee of a contingent AIP grant or the Estate shall be
              entitled to receive payment of an AIP award as, and to the extent,
              determined by the Committee;

         (ii) if the holder of Performance Stock Units shall have been employed
              for at least two-thirds of the related performance cycle prior to
              the date of termination or death, then, except as otherwise
              provided in the written instrument (if any) evidencing the
              Performance Stock Units, and subject to any further adjustments
              the Committee may make in its absolute discretion, the participant
              or the Estate shall be entitled to receive payment of a PSU Award
              upon the expiration of the related performance

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

              cycle,  provided that such award shall be adjusted by multiplying
              the amount thereof by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
              the number of full and partial  calendar  months between the date
              of the beginning of each such  performance  cycle and the date of
              termination or death,  and the  denominator of which shall be the
              number of full and partial  calendar  months from the date of the
              beginning  of  the  performance  cycle  to the  end  of the  said
              performance cycle;




         (iii)except as otherwise provided in the terms and conditions of the
              stock option or SAR grant, the holder or the Estate shall be
              entitled to exercise (provided any vesting requirement has been
              satisfied as of the date of exercise) any Option or SAR for a
              period of five years (three years in the case of options or SARs
              granted prior to 1997) from such date of death, total disability
              or retirement, or for such longer period as the Committee may
              determine in the case of financial hardship or other unusual
              circumstances (subject to the maximum exercise period for Options
              and SARs specified in Paragraph 7II(b) and 7III(a) hereof,
              respectively);

         (iv) except as otherwise provided in the written instrument evidencing
              the Restricted Stock Units, upon death or termination due to total
              disability the holder or the Estate shall be entitled to receive
              payment in respect of the Restricted Stock Units, provided that
              such Units shall be adjusted by multiplying the amount thereof by
              a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full and
              partial calendar months between the date of grant of such Units
              and the date of death or termination, and the denominator of which
              shall be the number of full and partial calendar months from the
              date of the grant to the end of the Restriction Period. Upon
              retirement, the participant's rights with respect to Restricted
              Stock Units shall immediately terminate.

     (c) In the event of resignation by the participant, the participant's
         rights and interests under the Plan shall immediately terminate upon
         such resignation; provided, however, that the Committee shall have the
         absolute discretion to review the reasons and circumstances of the
         resignation and to determine whether, alternatively, and to what
         extent, if any, the participant may continue to hold any rights or
         interests under the Plan.

     (d) A transfer of a participant's employment without an intervening period
         from the Corporation to a Subsidiary Corporation or vice versa, or from
         one Subsidiary Corporation to another, shall not be deemed a
         termination of employment.

     (e) The Committee shall be authorized to make all determinations and
         calculations required by this Paragraph 8, including any determinations
         necessary to establish the reason for terminations of employment for
         purposes of the Plan, which determinations and calculations shall be
         conclusive and binding on any affected participants and Estates.

9.   PERFORMANCE FACTORS; ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     Without  limiting  the type or number of awards that may be made under this
     Plan, an award may be in the form of a performance-based  award intended to
     comply as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code
     (such award a  "Performance  Award").  A  Performance  Award shall be paid,
     vested or otherwise  deliverable solely on account of the attainment of one
     or more pre-established,  objective performance goals ("Performance Goals")
     established  by the Committee  prior to the earlier to occur of (x) 90 days
     after the  commencement  of the period of service to which the  Performance
     Goal  relates  and (y) the  elapse  of 25% of the  period  of  service  (as
     established in good faith at the time the Performance Goal is established),
     and  in  any  event  while  the  outcome  is  substantially   uncertain.  A
     Performance  Goal is  objective  if a third party  having  knowledge of the
     relevant facts could determine  whether the goal is met. A Performance Goal
     may be based on one or more of the following  business  criteria:  earnings
     per share, return on net assets, market share, control of costs, net sales,
     cash flow, return on invested capital, economic value-added measures, sales
     growth, earnings growth, stock price, return on equity,  financial ratings,
     regulatory  compliance,  achievement  of balance sheet or income  statement
     objectives,  or other  financial,  accounting  or  quantitative  objectives
     established by the Committee  (collectively,  the  "Performance  Factors").
     Performance  Factors may be particular  to a  participant  or the division,
     line of  business  or other  unit in which the  participant  works,  or the
     Corporation  generally,  or may be  absolute  in their  terms  or  measured
     against  or in  relationship  to the  performance  of a peer group or other
     external or internal  measure.  A  Performance  Goal may,  but need not be,
     based upon a change or an increase or positive  result  under a  particular
     Performance Factor and could include,  for example,  maintaining the status
     quo, limiting  economic losses, or a relative  comparison of performance to
     the  performance  of a peer group or other  external  or  internal  measure
     (measured,  in each case, by reference to specific Performance  Factors). A
     Performance   Goal  may  include  or  exclude  items  to  measure  specific
     objectives,   including,   without   limitation,   extraordinary  or  other
     non-recurring items, acquisitions and divestitures,  internal restructuring
     and reorganizations,  accounting charges and effects of accounting changes.
     In  interpreting  Plan  provisions  applicable  to  Performance  Goals  and
     Performance  Awards  applicable  to awards to  employees  who are  "covered
     employees"  under Section  162(m) of the Code, it is the intent of the Plan
     to conform with the  standards  of Section  162(m) of the Code and Treasury
     Regulations  Section  1.162-27(e)(2)(i),  and the Committee in establishing
     such goals and  interpreting  the Plan shall be guided by such  provisions.
     Prior  to the  payment  of any  compensation  based on the  achievement  of
     Performance  Goals to any  such  "covered  employee",  the  Committee  must
     certify  in  writing  that  applicable  Performance  Goals  and  any of the
     material terms thereof were, in fact,  satisfied.  Subject to the foregoing
     provisions,  the  terms,  conditions  and  limitations  applicable  to  any
     Performance  Awards made  pursuant to this Plan shall be  determined by the
     Committee.

     No Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units
     (hereinafter collectively an "Interest") granted pursuant to the Plan shall
     be exercisable or realized in whole or in part, and the Corporation shall
     not be obligated to sell, distribute or issue any shares subject to any
     such Interest, if such exercise and sale would, in the opinion of

                                      -14-
<PAGE>


     counsel for the Corporation, violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
     (or other Federal or state  statutes  having  similar  requirements).  Each
     Interest shall be subject to the further  requirement  that, if at any time
     the Board of Directors  shall  determine in its discretion that the listing
     or  qualification  of the shares relating or subject to such Interest under
     any securities  exchange  requirements  or under any applicable law, or the
     consent or approval of any  governmental  regulatory  body, is necessary or
     desirable as a condition  of, or in connection  with,  the granting of such
     Interest or the distribution or issue of shares  thereunder,  such Interest
     may  not  be   exercised   in  whole  or  in  part  unless  such   listing,
     qualification,  consent or  approval  shall have been  effected or obtained
     free of any condition not acceptable to the Board of Directors.

     Interests may be subject to restrictions as to resale or other disposition
     and to such other provisions as may be appropriate to comply with Federal
     and state securities laws and stock exchange requirements, and the exercise
     of any Interest or entitlement to payment thereunder may be contingent upon
     receipt from the holder (or any other person permitted by this Plan to
     exercise any Interest or receive any distribution hereunder) of a
     representation that at the time of such exercise it is his or her then
     present intention to acquire the shares being distributed for investment
     and not for resale.

10.  NONTRANSFERABILITY

     Unless otherwise approved by the Committee, contingent AIP grants,
     Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs and Restricted Stock Units granted
     under the Plan to an employee shall be nonassignable and shall not be
     transferable by him or her otherwise than by will or the laws of descent
     and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during the employee's lifetime,
     only by the employee or the employee's guardian or legal representative.

11.  DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

     No provision in the Plan or any contingent target AIP grants, Performance
     Stock Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to
     the Plan shall be construed to confer upon the participant any right to be
     employed by the Corporation or by any Subsidiary Corporation, or to
     interfere in any way with the right and authority of the Corporation or any
     Subsidiary Corporation either to increase or decrease the compensation of
     the participant at any time, or to terminate any relationship of employment
     between the participant and the Corporation or any of its Subsidiary
     Corporations.

     Participants under the Plan shall have none of the rights of a stockholder
     of the Corporation with respect to shares subject to Performance Stock
     Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units unless and until such shares
     have been issued to him or her.

12.  STOCK ADJUSTMENTS

     In the event that the shares of Common Stock, as presently constituted,
     shall be changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
     of stock or other securities of the Corporation or of another corporation
     (whether by reason of merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
     reclassification, stock split, combination of shares or otherwise), or if
     the number of such shares of Common Stock shall be increased through the
     payment of a stock dividend, or a dividend on the shares of Common Stock of
     rights or warrants to purchase securities of the Corporation shall be made,
     then there shall be substituted for or added to each share available under
     and subject to the Plan as provided in Paragraph 2 hereof, and to the
     limitations set forth in Paragraphs 7II (c); 7III (g) and 7IV (e), and each
     share theretofore appropriated or thereafter subject or which may become
     subject to Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units
     under the Plan, the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities
     into which each outstanding share of Common Stock shall be so changed or
     for which each such share shall be exchanged or to which each such share
     shall be entitled, as the case may be. Outstanding Options and SARs also
     shall be appropriately amended as to price and other terms as may be
     necessary to reflect the foregoing events. In the event there shall be any
     other change in the number or kind of the outstanding shares of Common
     Stock, or of any stock or other securities into which the Common Stock
     shall have been changed or for which it shall have been exchanged, then if
     the Board of Directors shall, in its sole discretion, determine that such
     change equitably requires an adjustment in the shares available under and
     subject to the Plan, or in any Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs or
     Restricted Stock Units theretofore granted or which may be granted under
     the Plan, such adjustments shall be made in accordance with such
     determination.

     No fractional shares of Common Stock or units of other securities shall be
     issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from
     any such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding downward
     to the nearest whole share or unit.

13.  TAXES

     The Corporation shall be entitled to withhold the amount of any tax
     attributable to any amounts payable or shares of Common Stock deliverable
     under the Plan. The person entitled to any such delivery, whether due to
     the settlement of PSUs, the exercise of an Option or SAR, or the vesting of
     Restricted Stock Units, or any other taxable event may, by notice to the
     Corporation, elect to have any such required withholding satisfied by a
     reduction of the number of shares otherwise so deliverable (a "Stock
     Withholding Election"), or by delivery of shares of Stock already owned by
     the Participant, with the amount of shares subject to such reduction or
     delivery to be calculated based on the Fair Market Value on the date of
     such taxable event.

14.  EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

     The Plan as amended and restated herein shall become effective upon
     adoption by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

     The Board of Directors at any time may terminate the Plan, but such
     termination shall not alter or impair any of the rights or obligations
     under any contingent target AIP grants, Performance Stock Units, Options,
     SARs or Restricted Stock Units theretofore granted under the Plan unless
     the affected participant shall so consent.

15.  APPLICATION OF FUNDS

     The proceeds received by the Corporation from the sale of capital stock
     pursuant to Options will be used for general corporate purposes.

16.  AMENDMENT

     The Board of Directors by majority vote, at any time and from time to time,
     may amend the Plan in such respects as it shall deem advisable, to conform
     to any change in any applicable law or in any other respect; provided that
     any such amendment shall not adversely alter or impair any of the rights or
     obligations under any contingent target AIP grants, Performance Stock
     Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units theretofore granted under
     the Plan unless the affected participant shall so consent. Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, the Plan may not be terminated or amended in a manner
     adverse to the interests of any participant (without the consent of the
     participant) either: (a) after a Potential Change in Control occurs and for
     one (1) year following the cessation of a Potential Change in Control, or
     (b) for a two-year period beginning as of the date of a Change in Control
     (the "Coverage Period"). Upon the expiration of the Coverage Period,
     subparagraph (l) of Paragraph 7II of the Plan and Paragraph 8 (a) of the
     Plan may not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect any
     participant without the consent of the participant.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Key Employee Incentive
Plan to be amended and restated as of the 19th day of August, 2002.

Employee  Incentive  Plan to defer receipt of all or part of their  awards:  (1)
cash  awards  under the  Annual  Incentive  Program  (the  "AIP");  (2) the cash

Program  ("LTIP");  and (3) awards of Common  Stock of the  Company  pursuant to
Restricted  Stock Unit ("RSU") awards under the LTIP granted on or after January
1, 2001.  The Plan is intended to benefit those key  executives of Hershey Foods
Corporation and subsidiaries as specified in the AIP and LTIP who participate in
the AIP or LTIP, to secure their goodwill, loyalty and achievement,  and to help

The Committee may, in its discretion,  allow credit towards such requirement for
Company  Common Stock  constructively  invested by such  employee  pursuant to a
vested PSU or vested RSU deferred under this Plan.  Dividends previously earned,
as well as future  dividends  earned on  deferred  PSU awards and  deferred  RSU
awards, are eligible for deferral under the Plan.

          2.1     ELECTION TO DEFER.

                  a.    AIP AWARDS.  A Participant  may elect under the Plan to
defer receipt of all or a portion of his or her anticipated bonus under the AIP.
A  Participant's  election  must be made no later than  November 1st of the Plan
Year in which the  Participant  renders the services which may result in the AIP
bonus award.

                  b.    PSU AWARDS. A Participant may elect under the Plan to
defer  receipt of all or a portion of the cash or Company  Common  Stock  amount
earned as a PSU award under the LTIP,  provided  that,  unless the Committee has

requirements  established by the Board of Directors. A Participant's election to

least  sixty  (60)  days  prior to the date the PSU  award  will be paid or,  if
earlier, by the December 31 preceding the date such PSU award will be paid.

                                       3
<PAGE>

occurrence of a Change in Control, all restrictions on a Participant's RSU award
shall lapse pursuant to the terms of the KEIP.

                  d.    CHANGE IN CONTROL ELECTION FOR EBPP PARTICIPANTS. For
each  Participant  who is covered by an EBPP, the Company shall, on the later of
(i) the first day of January of the year first following the year during which a
Change  in  Control  occurs  and  (ii) the one  hundred  twentieth  (120th)  day
following  such  Change in  Control,  pay to him or her a lump sum cash  payment
equal to the amount of his or her  Account if prior to such  Change in  Control,
such Participant elects, in his or her sole discretion, to receive such lump sum
cash payment at such time.

                  e.    VESTED PENSION BENEFIT. If a Participant does not elect,
pursuant to Section 2.4 of the EBPP  applicable to him or her, to receive his or
her Vested Pension  Benefit (as such term is defined in such EBPP),  such amount
shall be deferred under the Plan in accordance with the terms of such EBPP.

                  f.    PARTICIPANTS  WHO ARE NOT EBPP  PARTICIPANTS.  Any
Participant who is not a participant in any EBPP shall, upon the occurrence of a
Change in Control,  become fully vested in his or her Account; and for each such
Participant  the Company shall,  on the later of (i) the first day of January of
the year first  following  the year during which a Change in Control  occurs and
(ii) the one hundred twentieth (120th) day following such Change in Control, pay
to him or her a lump sum cash payment  equal to the amount of his or her Account
if prior to such Change in Control,  such Participant elects, in his or her sole
discretion, to receive such lump sum cash payment at such time.

                  g.    Any deferral election under this Section 2.1 shall be
made on a form supplied by the Plan Administrator.  The election to defer an AIP
bonus,  a PSU  award  or an RSU  award is  irrevocable  except  as  specifically
provided otherwise in this Plan.

          2.2     ACCOUNTS.

                  a.    ESTABLISHMENT  OF  ACCOUNTS.  Except as provided in
Section 7.2,  any amounts  deferred by a  Participant  will not be funded or set
aside for future payment by the Company.  Instead,  an Account will be noted for
the Participant on the Company's books. A Participant's Account will be credited
with amounts  deferred and with  investment  credits as provided in paragraph c.
below. A separate Account will be established for each Deferral Election.

                  b.    PARTICIPANTS AS UNSECURED CREDITORS.  A Participant's
entitlement to receive the amount reflected by his or her Accounts will be based
solely on an unfunded unsecured unconditional promise to pay by the Company that
is not assignable; however, except as provided in Section 7.6 below or under the
terms of a Participant's  RSU award,  the Participant at all times will be fully
vested in the Accounts.

                  c.    INVESTMENT CREDITS TO ACCOUNTS.  Subject to such
limitations  as may from time to time be  required  by law,  imposed by the Plan
Administrator  or as set forth in  paragraph  (6)  below,  and  subject  to such
operating  rules and  procedures as may be imposed from time to time by the Plan
Administrator,  each  Participant  may  express  to  the  Plan  Administrator a

                                       4
<PAGE>
preference  as to how the  Participant's  Accounts  should be  constructively
invested among the  Investment  Options;  provided  that,  following a Change in
Control, any such preference expressed by a Participant (whether such preference
is expressed prior to, or following,  a Change in Control) shall be binding upon
the Plan  Administrator.  Such preference  shall designate the percentage of the
Participant's Accounts which is requested to be constructively  invested in each
Investment Option.

                        (1)    Any initial or subsequent  expression of
investment  preference shall be in writing, on a form supplied by and filed with
the Plan  Administrator.  Participants may change their  investment  preferences
effective as of the beginning of each Plan Year, or more frequently if permitted
in the discretion of the Plan Administrator; provided, however, that following a
Change in Control,  Participants  shall be permitted to change their  investment
preferences  at least as  frequently  as they could under  procedures  in effect
immediately prior to the Change in Control.

                        (2)   Except as set forth  above  following a Change in
Control,  all investment  preferences  shall be advisory only and shall not bind
the Company or the Plan  Administrator and the Company shall not be obligated to
invest any funds in connection with this Plan. If, however,  the Company chooses
to invest any amount to provide for its  liabilities  under this Plan,  the Plan
Administrator   shall  have  complete   discretion  as  to  investments  and  no
Participant  shall  have any  claim  on such  investments  as a fund to  provide
benefits hereunder.

                        (3)   From time to time, but not less frequently than
each Determination  Date, the Plan Administrator shall allocate the net earnings
or losses of the Plan since the preceding  Determination Date among the Accounts
of Participants, and to the extent a Participant's Investment Option preferences
are honored by the Plan  Administrator,  such net  earnings  or losses  shall be
allocated as though the Accounts had been invested in the  Investment  Option in
accordance with the  Participant's  indicated  preference.  The "net earnings or
losses" of the Plan shall be equal to the net increase or net  decrease  (taking
into account any constructive  dividends or interest  thereon),  as the case may
be, in the value of a Participant's  Accounts since the last  Determination Date
in  accordance  with the  Participant's  investment  preferences  or other  such
allocation  of  such  net  increase  or net  decrease  in  the  value  of  funds
constructively  invested by the Plan Administrator and allocated to the Accounts
of Participants hereunder.

                        (4)  If the  Plan  Administrator  receives  an  initial
or revised  investment  preference  which it deems to be incomplete,  unclear or
improper, the Participant's investment preference then in effect shall remain in
effect (or, in the case of a deficiency in an initial investment preference, the
Participant  shall be deemed to have filed no investment  preference)  until the
beginning of the next Plan Year, unless the Plan Administrator provides for, and
permits the application of,  corrective  action prior thereto.  If a Participant
fails to file an effective  investment  preference,  the Participant's  Accounts
will be constructively invested in the American Express Cash Management Fund (or
such Investment Option designated by the Plan Administrator from time to time as
a substitute for such Fund).

                       (5)   If the  Plan  Administrator  determines  that the
constructive value of an Account as of any date on which distributions are to be
made differs  materially from the constructive value of the Account on the prior
Determination Date upon which the distribution is

                                       5
<PAGE>

to be based, the Plan Administrator,  in its discretion, shall have the right to
designate  any date in the  interim as a  Determination  Date for the purpose of
constructively  revaluing  the  Account  so that  the  Account  from  which  the
distribution is being made will, prior to the distribution, reflect its share of
such material difference in value. Similarly, the Plan Administrator may adopt a
policy  of  providing  for  regular  interim  valuations  without  regard to the
materiality of changes in the value of the Accounts.

                        (6)  The   foregoing   provisions   of  this   paragraph
2.2(c) to the contrary  notwithstanding:  (i) prior to a Change in Control, that
portion of all deferred  PSUs that is payable in Company  Common Stock under the
LTIP and all deferred RSUs shall be  constructively  invested in Company  Common
Stock; (ii) the Participant's  Accounts shall be credited from time to time with
the amount of any dividends  declared and paid on such Company Common Stock, and
shall be adjusted in connection with any stock dividend, split,  reorganization,
liquidation  or other event which  affects the number of shares of Common  Stock
represented  by such PSUs and RSUs;  and (iii) no other amounts  deferred  under
this Plan shall be constructively  invested in Company Common Stock. Following a
Change in Control,  no amounts  deferred under this Plan shall be required to be
constructively invested in Company Common Stock.

                  d.    STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS.  Within a reasonable  time after
the  end of  each  Plan  Year,  the  Plan  Administrator  shall  submit  to each
Participant a statement of the balance in his Accounts;  provided, however, that
following a Change in Control,  such  statement of Accounts shall be provided on
at least a quarterly basis.

          2.3     CREDIT OF PRE-1995 AIP DEFERRALS TO ACCOUNTS.  Participants
who previously deferred AIP awards under the deferral arrangements in effect for
awards  prior to 1995 may elect as of any  beginning  of any Plan Year to credit
any portion of their  deferral  accounts  under the prior  arrangement  to their
Accounts  under this Plan.  Credits  shall be made to this Plan pursuant to this
Section  on January 1 of the Plan Year  subsequent  to any such  election  being
made.  Amounts so credited  shall  become part of a  Participant's  Accounts and
shall be subject to the terms and  conditions  of this Plan,  except  that prior
elections as to payment of deferred amounts shall remain in effect. Once amounts
are credited to a Participant's  Accounts pursuant to this Section 2.3, they may
not  thereafter be returned to the  Participant's  deferral  accounts  under the
prior deferral arrangement.

          2.4    CREDIT OF PRE-1995 DIVIDENDS PAID ON PSU DEFERRALS TO ACCOUNTS.
Participants who previously  received dividends on deferred PSU awards under the
deferral  arrangements  in effect for  awards  prior to 1995 may elect as of the
beginning  of any Plan Year to credit any portion of their  previously  deferred
dividends  under  the prior  arrangement  to their  Accounts  under  this  Plan.
Notwithstanding the above, previously deferred PSU dividends are not eligible to
be  deferred  pursuant  to the  terms of the Plan  unless  the  Participant  has
satisfied the employee  minimum  stockholding  requirements  established  by the
Committee.  Credits  shall be made to this Plan  pursuant to this Section on the
January 1 of the Plan Year  subsequent to any such election being made.  Amounts
so credited shall become part of a  Participant's  Accounts and shall be subject
to the terms and  conditions  of this Plan,  except that prior  elections  as to
payment of deferred amounts shall remain in effect. Once amounts are credited to
a Participant's  Accounts
                                       6
<PAGE>

pursuant  to this  Section  2.4,  they may not  thereafter  be  returned  to the
Participant's deferral accounts under the prior deferral arrangement.



                                  ARTICLE III
                            DISTRIBUTION OF DEFERRALS

          3.1     INITIAL ELECTION OF DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS IN DEFERRAL ELECTION.

                  a.    A Participant must specify in each of his or her
Deferral  Elections when such Account will be distributed.  Distribution  may be
made or begin in any future Plan Year or Years, but distributions must begin not
later than the Plan Year  following the calendar  year in which the  Participant
attains age 70. The Participant may elect to receive amounts  deferred in a lump
sum or in up to ten substantially equal annual  installments.  A Participant may
specify different  distribution  dates and forms of payment under each of his or
her Deferral Elections.  All amounts of a Participant's Accounts  constructively
invested in Company  Common  Stock shall be  distributed  in the form of Company
Common  Stock,  except in the event a Change in  Control  occurs,  in which case
amounts  constructively  invested in Company Common Stock shall be dealt with in
accordance with the terms of the EBPP applicable to such Participant.  All other
amounts shall be distributed in cash.

                  b.    Any provision of this Plan to the contrary
notwithstanding,  all distributions  hereunder shall be deferred until such time
(but not beyond the occurrence of a Change in Control unless otherwise specified
in a Participant's  Deferral Election),  in the discretion of the Committee,  as
such distribution would not be disallowed as a deduction under Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code.

          3.2     CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS.

                  a.    A Participant is entitled to one future  opportunity to
further  lengthen  (not  shorten)  the  deferral  period  provided in a Deferral
Election  and to  make  one  future  change  with  regard  to  lengthening  (not
shortening)  the payment  schedule  provided in that  Deferral  Election up to a
maximum payment schedule of ten years.

                  b.    Any change in the deferral  period or the payment
schedule  must be  submitted  to the Plan  Administrator  in writing,  on a form
provided by the Plan  Administrator,  at least  twelve  months,  or such shorter
period as the Plan  Administrator  may  accept,  but in no event  later than the
December 31,  before the date payments were  originally  scheduled to begin.  No
change in the  deferral  period  shall be  permitted  if such change would cause
payments to begin after the Plan Year  following  the calendar year in which the
Participant attains age 70.

          3.3     PAYMENT OF DEFERRED AMOUNTS.

                  a.    Upon the date elected by the  Participant,  the Company
shall begin to pay to the  Participant  an amount equal to the total amount then
credited to the Participant's  Accounts. Such amount is to be paid either in one
lump sum or in substantially equal annual installments over a period of years as
previously elected by the Participant, which period shall be not more

                                       7
<PAGE>

than ten years. Each annual  installment shall include investment credits on the
remaining  balance  during the previous Plan Year until the Accounts  shall have
been paid in full. A Participant may continue to express investment  preferences
as provided  in  paragraph c of Section 2.2 during the period that an Account is
being distributed.

                  b.    If the Participant  dies before payment in full of the
amount standing to the Participant's credit in the Accounts,  the unpaid balance
may be  paid in one  lump  sum or in  substantially  equal  installments  to the
Participant's  beneficiary over the remaining distribution period elected by the
Participant.  If the Participant  dies before the beginning date of the deferred
payment  and did not  indicate  a  specific  method  of  distribution,  then the
Participant's   designated  beneficiary  may  petition  the  Plan  Administrator
regarding  the  method  of   distribution.   In  the  absence  of  a  designated
beneficiary,  the  balance  of the  Accounts  will be paid in a lump  sum to the
estate of the Participant as soon as possible.

                  c.    If the  Participant's  employment  is  terminated  for
any reason other than Retirement, death or Disability before the elected payment
date,  then  the  Company,  acting  through  the  Plan  Administrator,   at  its
discretion,  but subject to any  limitations set forth in the EBPP applicable to
such Participant (or any similar or successor plan or program) or any employment
agreement  to  which  the  Participant  is a party  or is  covered,  at any time
thereafter may:

                        (1)  Immediately pay over any amounts credited to the
Participant's   Accounts  to  the  Participant;   provided,   however,  if  such
termination of employment occurs at any time following a Change in Control,  the
Company and the Plan  Administrator  may not pay over any amounts  credited to a
Participant's Accounts, unless prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control,
such Participant made an election  pursuant to which such Participant  consented
to receive an immediate payment of such Participant's Accounts in the event such
Participant's  employment  is  terminated  following a Change in Control for any
reason other than Retirement, death or Disability.

                        (2)  Deposit any amounts credited  to the  Participant's
Accounts in a grantor  trust for the  Company's  benefit who will manage and pay
over such amounts to the  Participant in accordance with the terms of this Plan,
with  administrative  costs in such event  being  charged  to the  Participant's
Accounts;  provided,  however,  that  following  a Change in  Control,  all such
administrative costs shall be borne solely by the Company.

                        (3)  Continue to itself  maintain and pay over amounts
deferred to the  Participant  in accordance  with the terms of this Plan and the
Participant's election pursuant thereto.

                  d.    If both  the  Participant  and his  beneficiary  die
after  payments to the  Participant  begin and before all payments are made from
the  Participant's  Accounts,  the  remaining  value  of the  Accounts  shall be
determined as of the date of death of the beneficiary or Participant,  whichever
is  later,  and shall be paid as  promptly  as  possible  in one lump sum to the
estate of the survivor of the Participant and such beneficiary.

                                       8
<PAGE>

                  e.    A  Participant  may designate or change his or her
beneficiary (without the consent of any prior beneficiary) on a form provided by
the Plan  Administrator  and  delivered  to the Plan  Administrator  before  the
Participant's death.

                  f.    Subject to  Section  3.1:  (1) if a  Participant  elects
to receive  amounts  deferred in a lump sum or in annual  installments on a date
prior to Retirement,  such payments will commence or payment will be made in the
month of  January  of the Plan  Year  selected  by the  Participant;  (2) if the
Participant elects to receive amounts deferred in a lump sum (other than amounts
deferred as Common  Stock for  payment in a lump sum) or in annual  installments
after  Retirement,  such payments shall commence or payment shall be made in the
month of  January  of the Plan Year  following  the  calendar  year in which the
Participant retires; and (3) if a Participant elects to receive amounts deferred
as Common Stock in a lump-sum after Retirement, such payment will be made in the
month of  January  of the Plan Year  following  the  calendar  year in which the
Participant   retires,   unless  an  earlier   date  is  approved  by  the  Plan
Administrator upon application by the Participant.

                  g.    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, at
any time, the Company determines (based on advice of tax counsel),  by reason of
legislation  relating  to,  amendment  of,  or  interpretation  by  a  court  or
administrative  body of, the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or any rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder,  that any amounts
deferred  by a  Participant  under this Plan shall be  currently  taxable,  such
Participant  shall be entitled to elect to receive immediate payment of any such
deferred amounts (without any reduction other than applicable tax withholding).

          3.4     HARDSHIP  DISTRIBUTIONS.  The Compensation Committee may, in
its discretion,  accelerate payments to a Participant in an amount up to the AIP
bonus or the cash  portion of a PSU award  previously  deferred,  together  with
investment  credits  to date,  in the  event of  demonstrated  severe  financial
hardship (or any similar  circumstances under which a payment would be permitted
without causing the imposition of federal income taxes on Participants' Accounts
that have not been  distributed,  pursuant  to  Revenue  Procedure  92-65 or any
successor  Revenue  Procedure,  Revenue Ruling,  regulation or other  applicable
administrative  determination  issued by the Internal Revenue Service.) Any such
payments  made will be  limited to the  amount  needed to meet the  demonstrated
financial need. A Participant  seeking a financial hardship  withdrawal from his
or her Accounts  must request a hearing  with the Plan  Administrator,  who will
gather facts and render a report to the Compensation Committee for a decision.

          3.5     OTHER  WITHDRAWALS:  FORFEITURE  PENALTY.  A Participant may,
by written request on a form provided by the Plan Administrator, withdraw all or
any portion of any of his Accounts as of any Determination  Date,  provided that
the Participant shall forfeit 10% of the amount withdrawn as a penalty.

          3.6     WITHHOLDING.  Any payments made pursuant to this Article III
shall be subject to appropriate federal, state or local income tax withholdings.
Any  withholdings  required in respect of a distribution of Company Common Stock
shall be deducted  from other cash amounts  then  distributed  hereunder  or, if
none,  from other cash  compensation  payable to  Participant.  If no other cash
compensation is then payable to the  Participant  then, in the discretion of the
Committee,  such  distribution  of Company  Common Stock shall be deferred until
such time as

                                       9
<PAGE>

(a) such cash  distribution or other  compensation is payable to the Participant
that can be withheld hereunder, or (b) the Participant deposits with the Company
such  amount  of  cash  and/or   directs  the  Company  to  withhold  from  such
distribution  such number of shares of Company Common Stock having a fair market
value (as  defined in the LTIP)  equal to the amount  required  to satisfy  such
withholding tax obligation.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                CLAIMS PROCEDURE

          4.1     The following provisions are incorporated in the Plan in
accordance with the requirements of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974:

                  a.    The following claims procedure is hereby established:

                        (1)  A Participant  or beneficiary  shall make a claim
for the benefits provided  hereunder by delivering a written request to the Plan
Administrator.  Upon receipt of a claim, the Plan Administrator  shall determine
whether to grant the claim, deny it, or grant it in part.

                        (2)  If a claim is wholly or partially  denied,  notice
of the decision,  meeting the  requirements  of paragraph (3) following shall be
furnished to the claimant within a reasonable  period of time after receipt of a
claim by the Plan Administrator.

                        (3)  The Plan Administrator shall provide to every
claimant who is denied a claim for benefits,  written  notice setting forth in a
manner  calculated  to be understood  by the  claimant,  the specific  reason or
reasons for the denial; specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which
denial is  based;  a  description  of any  additional  material  or  information
necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an  explanation  of why such
material or  information  is necessary;  and an  explanation of the Plan's claim
review procedure as set forth herein.

                        (4)  The purpose of the review procedures set forth
herein is to provide a procedure  by which a claimant  under the Plan may have a
reasonable  opportunity to appeal a denial of a claim to the named fiduciary for
a full and fair review.  To accomplish  that  purpose,  the claimant or his duly
authorized  representative may request a review upon written  application to the
Committee;  may review  pertinent  Plan  documents;  and may  submit  issues and
comments in writing.  A claimant (or his duly authorized  representative)  shall
request  a review  by  filing a written  application  for  review  with the Plan
Administrator  at any time within sixty (60) days after  receipt by the claimant
of written notice of denial of this claim.

                        (5)  The  decision  on review of a denied  claim  shall
be  made  as  follows.  The  decision  on  review  shall  be  made  by the  Plan
Administrator,  which may in its discretion  hold a hearing on the denied claim.
The Plan Administrator shall make a decision promptly,  and not later than sixty
(60) days after receipt of the request for review,  unless special circumstances
(such as the need to hold a  hearing)  require an  extension of time, in which
case a decision  shall be rendered as soon as  possible,  but not later than one
hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request for review.  The decision
on  review  shall be in  writing  and shall  include  specific  reasons  for the
decisions,  written in the manner  calculated  to be understood by the claimant,
and

                                       10
<PAGE>

specific  references  to the pertinent  Plan  revisions on which the decision is
based. The Plan Administrator shall have full discretion to decide the claim and
its decision on review shall be final and binding on all parties.

                  b. For the sole purpose of implementing the claims  procedure
(and not for any other purposes), the Plan Administrator is hereby designated as
a named fiduciary of this Plan.

                                   ARTICLE V
                               PLAN ADMINISTRATOR

          5.1     PLAN  ADMINISTRATOR  DUTIES.  The Plan  Administrator  shall
administer  this  Plan.  All  members  of  the  committee  comprising  the  Plan
Administrator may be Participants. A member of the committee comprising the Plan
Administrator  who is a Participant may not vote on matters affecting his or her
personal  benefit under this Plan, but any such  individual  shall  otherwise be
fully  entitled  to  act  in  matters  arising  out of or  affecting  this  Plan
notwithstanding  his or her participation  herein. The Plan Administrator  shall
have the authority to make, amend, interpret,  and enforce all appropriate rules
and  regulations for the  administration  of this Plan and decide or resolve any
and all  questions,  including  interpretations  of this  Plan,  as may arise in
connection with the Plan.

          5.2     AGENTS.  In the administration of this Plan, the Plan
Administrator  may, from time to time,  employ agents and delegate to them or to
others  (including  employees of the Company) such  administrative  duties as it
sees fit. The Plan Administrator may from time to time consult with counsel, who
may be counsel to the Company.

          5.3     BINDING  EFFECT OF DECISIONS.  In carrying out its duties
herein,  the Plan  Administrator (or its designee) shall have full discretion to
exercise all powers and to make all determinations, consistent with the terms of
the Plan, in all matters entrusted to it, and its determinations  shall be final
and binding on all parties.

          5.4     INDEMNITY.  The  Company  shall indemnify  and  hold  harmless
the Plan  Administrator  and any employees to whom  administrative  duties under
this Plan are delegated,  against any and all claims, loss, damage,  expense, or
liability  arising  from any action or failure to act with respect to this Plan,
except in the case of willful misconduct.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

          6.1     AMENDMENT.  The Committee may at any time amend the Plan in
whole or in part.  However,  no  amendment  shall be  effective  to  decrease or
restrict any then existing Account or to change the Company's  obligations under
any then  existing  Deferral  Election  or as  otherwise  may be  provided in an
agreement entered into between the Company and the Participant prior to the date
of such Deferral Election or the Company's  Executive  Benefits  Protection Plan
(or any similar or successor plan or program).  After the occurrence of a Change
in  Control,  no  amendment  to the Plan may be made to this  Section  6.1 or to
Sections 1.11, 2.2(c),  2.2(d), 3.1(b), 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 6.2, 7.6 or 7.9 that
would adversely affect the rights of any Participant without the consent of such
Participant, except for such changes that the Committee reasonably

                                       11
<PAGE>

determines,  upon the advice of nationally recognized tax counsel, are necessary
to  fulfill  the  intent  of the  Plan  to  defer  federal  income  taxation  of
Participants' Accounts until such Accounts are paid in accordance with the terms
of the Plan.

          6.2     BOARD'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE.  The Board may at any time
terminate  the Plan in its  entirety,  in which event no new Deferral  Elections
shall be made,  but the  obligations  of the  Company  under this Plan and under
existing Deferral Elections shall continue.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          7.1     UNFUNDED  PLAN.  This Plan is intended to be an "unfunded"
plan maintained  primarily to provide deferred  compensation for a "select group
of  management  or highly  compensated  employees"  within  the  meaning  of the
Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974, as amended,  and shall be so
construed.

          7.2     RABBI TRUST.  The Company shall establish promptly a revocable
trust to hold assets,  subject to the claims of the  Company's  creditors in the
event  of the  Company's  insolvency,  for the  purpose  of the  payment  of the
benefits hereunder, which shall become irrevocable upon a Change in Control. The
Company shall  contribute to the Trust cash in such amounts and at such times as
are  specified  in this Plan and in the  applicable  trust  agreement.  Upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control,  the Company  shall  contribute to a separate
Trust  account  maintained  for each  Participant  under the Trust,  in cash, an
amount equal to 100% of the value of each such Participant's  Account,  less any
amount  credited  to such  Participant's  Trust  account  as of the date of such
contribution.  Amounts paid to  Participants  from the Trust shall discharge the
obligations of the Company  hereunder to the  Participants  to the extent of the
payments so made.

          7.3     UNSECURED  GENERAL CREDITOR.  This Plan is unfunded.  Benefits
shall  be paid  from  the  Company's  general  assets.  Participants  and  their
beneficiaries,  heirs, successors,  and assigns shall have no legal or equitable
rights,  interest  or claims  in any  property  or assets  owned or which may be
acquired by the Company.  Such assets of the Company shall not be held under any
trust for the benefit of Participants, their beneficiaries, heirs, successors or
assigns,  or held in any way as collateral  security  against the obligations of
the Company under this Plan.  The Company's  obligation  under the Plan shall be
that of an  unfunded  and  unsecured  promise of the Company to pay money in the
future. The Company in its sole discretion,  may, however,  elect to provide for
its liabilities  under this Plan through a trust or funding  vehicle,  provided,
however, that the terms of any such trust or funding vehicle shall not alter the
status of Participants and beneficiaries as mere general unsecured  creditors of
the  Company or  otherwise  cause the Plan to be funded or  benefits  taxable to
Participants except upon actual receipt.

          7.4     NONASSIGNABILITY.  Neither a Participant nor any other person
shall have any right to commute,  sell, assign,  transfer,  pledge,  anticipate,
mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer,  hypothecate, or convey in advance of
actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder,  or any part thereof. The
rights  to all such  amounts  are  expressly  declared  to be  unassignable  and
non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment,
be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts,  judgments,
alimony,  or separate

                                       12
<PAGE>

maintenance  owed by  Participants  or any other person,  nor be transferable by
operation  of  law  in the  event  of a  Participant's  or  any  other  person's
bankruptcy or insolvency, except as required by law.

          7.5     NOT A CONTRACT OF  EMPLOYMENT.  The terms and  conditions of
this Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between the
Company and a  Participant,  and a Participant  shall have no rights against the
Company  except as may  otherwise be  specifically  provided  herein.  Moreover,
nothing  in the Plan  shall be  deemed  to give a  Participant  the  right to be
retained  in the service of the  Company or to  interfere  with the right of the
Company to  discipline  or  discharge  an employee at any time.  This  foregoing
provisions of this Section 7.5 to the contrary notwithstanding,  this Plan shall
not diminish  any rights or increase any  obligations  of a  Participant  or the
Company under any employment  agreement  entered into by the Participant and the
Company prior to such Participant's  Deferral  Election,  or after such Deferral
Election to the extent that such employment agreement specifically provides that
it shall supersede any inconsistency with the terms of this Plan.

          7.6     FORFEITURE OF BENEFITS.  If a Participant's  employment is
terminated because of willful misfeasance or gross negligence in the performance
of his or her duties, his or her right to benefits under this Plan shall, in the
discretion of the Committee, be forfeited, and the Company shall have no further
obligation  hereunder  to  such  Participant  or his  or  her  beneficiary(ies);
provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, upon a Change
in Control, a Participant's AIP benefits,  PSU benefits,  Vested Pension Benefit
and RSU benefits  deferred under the Plan  (together,  the "Deferred  Benefits")
shall vest and be payable  pursuant to the  provisions  of Sections 2.1, 2.2 and
2.5 of the EBPP applicable to such  Participant and Section 7.IV(b) of the KEIP,
respectively,  and  such  vested  Deferred  Benefits  shall  not be  subject  to
forfeiture  under this Section 7.6. If a Participant is not a participant  under
any EBPP or the KEIP, upon a Change in Control, Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.5 of the
Employee  Benefits  Protection  Plan (Group 2) and  Section  7.IV(b) of the KEIP
shall  nevertheless  apply  to the  Participant's  Deferred  Benefits  and  such
Deferred Benefits shall not be subject to forfeiture under this Section 7.6.

          7.7     TERMS.  Use of the masculine,  feminine and neuter pronouns in
this  Plan are  intended  to be  interchangeable  and use of the  singular  will
include the plural, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

          7.8     CAPTIONS.  The captions of the articles, sections and
paragraphs of this Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect
the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.

          7.9     GOVERNING LAW.  This Plan shall be governed by the laws of the
United  States  and,  to  the  extent  not  preempted   thereby,   the  laws  of
Pennsylvania;  provided,  however,  that after a Change in Control, any court or
tribunal that adjudicates any dispute,  controversy or claim arising between the
Participants  and the  Committee,  Plan  Administrator,  Company or any of their
delegates or successors,  relating to or concerning the provisions of this Plan,
will  apply a de novo  standard  of  review to any  determinations  made by such
person.  Such de novo  standard  shall apply  notwithstanding  the grant of full
discretion  hereunder to any such person or  characterization of any decision by
such person as final, binding or conclusive on any party.

          7.10    VALIDITY.  The illegality or invalidity of any provision of
this Plan shall not affect its remaining parts, but this Plan shall be construed
and enforced without such illegal or invalid provisions.

          7.11    NOTICE.  Any notice or filing required or permitted to be

                           Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033

                  Such notice  shall be deemed  given as of the date of delivery
or, if  delivery  is made by mail,  as of the date shown on the  postmark on the
receipt for registration or certification.

          7.12    SUCCESSORS. The provisions of this Plan shall bind and inure
to the  benefit  of the  Company  and  its  successors  and  assigns.  The  term
successors as used herein shall include any corporation or other business entity
which shall, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets, or otherwise,
acquire all or substantially  all of the business or assets of the Company,  and
successors of any such corporation or other business entity.

          7.13    INCAPACITY.  If the  Plan  Administrator  finds  that any

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                           AMENDED AND RESTATED (2002)
                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN



         1.     PURPOSE OF PLAN. The purpose of the Amended and Restated (2002)
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, effective as of August 19, 2002
(hereinafter called the "Plan") is to obtain for Hershey Foods Corporation
(hereinafter called the "Corporation") all of the benefits which flow from
maintaining a strong management team by providing to executive and upper level
management employees the means to continue their attained standard of living
during retirement and by offering benefits that will assist in attracting
executive and upper level management employees of outstanding ability. The Plan
constitutes an amendment, restatement and continuation of the prior plan which
was most recently restated as of January 1, 2002.

                To the extent provided by law, the benefits provided hereunder
with respect to any Participant who retired or whose employment with the
Corporation terminated prior to August 6, 2002, will, except as otherwise
specifically provided for herein, be governed in all respects by the terms of
the plan document then in effect on the date of the Participant's retirement or
other termination of employment.

         2.     DEFINITIONS.  The  following  words and  phrases  as used in the
Plan shall have the following  meanings,  unless a different  meaning is plainly
required by the context:

                a.  "Cause"  means the  willful  engaging  by an  employee  of
the Corporation in illegal conduct or gross  misconduct  which is materially and
demonstrably injurious to the Corporation.

                For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act, on
the part of an employee of the Corporation, shall be considered "willful" unless
it is done, or omitted to be done, by the employee in bad faith and without
reasonable belief that the employee's action or omission was in the best
interest of the Corporation. Any act or failure to act, based upon prior
approval given by the Board or upon the instruction or with the approval of the
Chief Executive Officer or the employee's superior or based upon the advice of
counsel for the Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
omitted to be done, by the employee in good faith and in the best interest of
the Corporation.

                b.  "Committee" means the Compensation and Executive
Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the
"Board") or other such person, persons or committees as the Board may prescribe
from time to time.

                Effective as of October 2, 2001, Committee shall also mean the
Employee Benefits Committee of the Corporation, to which the Board has delegated
certain duties with respect to the administration of the Corporation's employee
benefit plans, or any successor

<PAGE>

 committee as designated by the Board.

                c.  "Deferred Retirement Date" means the first day of the month
following an employee's termination of employment with the Corporation provided
such termination occurs after his Normal Retirement Date.

                d.  "Disability" or "Disabled", for purposes of this Plan,
shall have the same meaning as provided in Section 1.16 of the Retirement Plan,
as such section may be amended from time to time.

                e.  "Early Retirement Date" means the first day of any month
following an employee's termination of employment with the Corporation which is
coincident with or following his fifty-fifth (55th) birthday and prior to his
Normal Retirement Date.

                Effective as of January 1, 2002, Early Retirement Date means
the first day of any month following a Participant's termination of employment
with the Corporation which is coincident with or following the earlier of (i)
the date the Participant attains age fifty-five (55) or (ii) the date the
Committee (in its sole discretion) deems the Participant to have attained age
fifty-five (55) if such Participant terminated his or her employment with the
Corporation under an early retirement plan, program or arrangement and prior to
the Participant's Normal Retirement Date.

                f.  "Final Average Compensation" means the sum of (1) the
highest annual average of a Vested Participant's basic salary paid or accrued
over any thirty-six (36) consecutive month period during his last ten (10) years
of employment with the Corporation and (2) the highest annual average of his
annual awards under the Annual Incentive Program (hereinafter called the "AIP")
of the Corporation's Key Employee Incentive Plan ("KEIP") paid or accrued over
any five (5) consecutive calendar years during his last ten (10) years of
employment with the Corporation. If a Vested Participant dies, retires, or
suffers a Disability or if a Participant suffers a Disability during a calendar
year and only a partial AIP award is made for that year, for purposes of the
Plan, his AIP award for such year will be considered to equal the award actually
made divided by the fraction of such year that he was employed by the
Corporation prior to his death, retirement or Disability. If a Vested
Participant otherwise terminates employment with the Corporation during a
calendar year, his AIP award for that year for purposes of the Plan will be
considered to be zero (0), regardless of whether any AIP award is actually made
for that year.

                g.  "GATT Interest Rate" means, for purposes of this Plan, for
any specific month, the "applicable interest rate" as specified by the
Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service in Section 417(e)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (as such applicable
interest rate is modified from time to time in revenue rulings, notices or other
guidance, published in the Internal Revenue Service Bulletin), decreased by the
percentage applicable to such month as set forth on Schedule I attached hereto.

                h.  "Lump Sum Interest Rate" means, as of any specific date,
the sum of one-twelfth (1/12th) of each GATT Interest Rate for the twelve
consecutive

                                      -2-

months  beginning  with the thirteenth  (13th) month  preceding the month during

Plan, the first day of the month nearest an employee's sixty-fifth (65th)
birthday, except that if his birthday is equally near the first of two calendar
months, the first day of the month prior to his sixty-fifth (65th) birthday
shall be his Normal Retirement Date.

                j.  "PBGC Interest Rate" means, for any specific month, the
interest rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for such month
for purposes of valuing immediate annuities for terminating single employer
plans with insufficient assets to pay guaranteed benefits.

                k.  "Participant" means, as of any specific date, an employee
of the Corporation who, as of such date, is a participant in the performance
share unit portion of the KEIP or who, as of such date, is not then but had been
a participant in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP for at least
five (5) of his last ten (10) years of employment with the Corporation.

                l.  "Retirement Plan" means the Corporation's Retirement Plan,

and any successor plan thereto.

                m.  "Vested Participant" means, as of any specific date, a
Participant who, as of such date, satisfies each eligibility requirement set
forth in the first sentence of Section 3 of the Plan or any prior version of the
Plan.

                n.  "Years of Service", for purposes of this Plan, shall have
the same meaning as provided in Section 1.59 of the Retirement Plan, as such
section may be amended from time to time.

         3.     ELIGIBILITY. An employee of the Corporation will be eligible to
receive a benefit pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan if, at the time of his
termination of employment with the Corporation, such employee (i) is at least
fifty-five (55) years of age, (ii) has ten (10) Years of Service, and (iii) has
participated in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP for at least five
(5) of his last ten (10) years of employment with the Corporation. No employee
of the Corporation, regardless of whether he satisfies all the eligibility
requirements to be a Vested Participant, shall be entitled to receive any
benefits under the Plan if his employment with the Corporation is terminated for
Cause. Notwithstanding the above, an employee whose employment is terminated
with the Corporation prior to his Normal Retirement Date for reason of
Disability will be treated as provided for in Section 4.c.

                Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, with
respect to a person who elected to participate in the Hershey Foods Corporation
2001 Early Retirement Plan (the "ERP") and who terminates his or her employment
with the Corporation under the terms and conditions of the ERP (an "ERP
Participant"), such person's age at the time of his

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

or her  termination  from  employment  shall be the greater of (y) such person's
actual age or (z) age fifty-five (55) for purposes of determining  such person's
eligibility  to receive a benefit under this Plan as set forth in subsection (i)
of this Section.

         4.     RETIREMENT BENEFITS.

                a.  Normal Retirement Benefit. An employee who qualifies as a
Vested Participant on the date of his termination of employment with the
Corporation, and who retires (or whose employment is otherwise terminated, other
than for Cause) on or after his Normal Retirement Date shall be entitled under
the Plan to receive a normal retirement benefit which shall be an annual
benefit, payable in monthly installments, equal to:

                    (1)   the  product of three and  two-thirds percent (3 2/3%)
     of his Final Average Compensation and his Years of Service not in excess of
     fifteen (15) Years of Service;

                    reduced by:

                    (2)   one hundred percent (100%) of the Vested
         Participant's retirement benefit under the Retirement Plan and any
         other tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan maintained by the
         Corporation or any affiliate thereof or any defined benefit pension
         plan maintained by any other entity, payable as a life annuity
         commencing at his Normal Retirement Date or his Deferred Retirement
         Date if he retires after his Normal Retirement Date, regardless of
         whether such benefit payment is in that form or begins at that time;
         and

                    (3)   one hundred percent (100%) of the primary social
         security benefit to which the Vested Participant would be entitled on
         his Normal Retirement Date or his Deferred Retirement Date if he
         retires after his Normal Retirement Date regardless of whether he
         receives any portion of such primary Social Security benefit on such
         date.

                Payment of such benefit shall commence on his Normal
Retirement Date if he retires (or otherwise has his employment terminated, other
than for Cause) on such date and on his Deferred Retirement Date if he retires
(or otherwise has his employment terminated, other than for Cause) after his
Normal Retirement Date.

                b.  Early Retirement Benefit. An employee who qualifies as a
Vested Participant on the date of his termination of employment with the
Corporation, and who retires (or whose employment is otherwise terminated, other
than for Cause) on or after his Early Retirement Date and prior to his Normal
Retirement Date shall be entitled under the Plan to receive an early retirement
benefit which shall be an annual benefit payable in monthly installments, equal
to:

                    (1)   for an ERP Participant, the product of:

                          (A) the benefit determined in accordance with Section
                    4.a. above;

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
                    and

                          (B) one (1) minus the product of (i)
                   five-twelfths of a percent (5/12%), and (ii) the
                   number of complete calendar months by which the
                   Vested Participant's date of termination of
                   employment precedes his sixtieth (60th) birthday.
                   Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to
                   the contrary, with respect to an ERP Participant, the
                   number of complete calendar months described in
                   subsection 4b.(1)(B)(ii) shall not exceed sixty (60).

                    (2)   for a Participant other than an ERP Participant:

                          (A) the product of three and two-thirds
                    percent (3 2/3%) of his Final Average Compensation
                    and his Years of Service not in excess of fifteen
                    (15) Years of Service reduced by the sum of (B), (C)
                    and (D), where (B), (C) and (D) equal:

                          (B) one hundred percent (100%) of his
                    retirement benefit under the Retirement Plan and any
                    other tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan
                    maintained by the Corporation or any affiliate
                    thereof or any defined benefit pension plan
                    maintained by any other entity, payable as a life
                    annuity commencing at his Early Retirement Date or
                    the first date thereafter on which such benefits
                    would be payable if they are not payable on his Early
                    Retirement Date regardless of whether such benefit
                    payment is in that form or begins at that time;

                          (C) one hundred percent (100%) of the
                    primary Social Security benefit to which the Vested
                    Participant would be entitled on his Early Retirement
                    Date or the first date thereafter on which such
                    benefits would be payable if they are not payable on
                    his Early Retirement Date regardless of whether he
                    receives any portion of such primary Social Security
                    benefit on such date; and

                          (D) the product of (i) the difference
                   between (A) and the sum of (B) and (C), (ii)
                   five-twelfths of a percent (5/12%), and (iii) the
                   number of complete calendar months by which the
                   Vested Participant's date of termination of
                   employment precedes his sixtieth (60th) birthday.

                Payment of such benefit shall commence on the first day of the
month coincident with the Vested Participant's retirement or other termination
of employment, other than for Cause.

                c.  Disability Retirement Benefit. If an employee who is an
active participant in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP suffers a
Disability prior to his Normal Retirement Date and while employed by the
Corporation, the period of his Disability will be recognized as Years of Service
and as years of participation in the performance share

                                      -5-
<PAGE>


unit  portion of the KEIP under the Plan.  If such  Disability  continues to his
Normal  Retirement  Date,  for purposes of the Plan, he will retire on that date
and will be entitled to a normal  retirement  benefit  calculated  in accordance
with Section 4.a.  commencing  on that date.  In  calculating  the benefit under
Section 4.a., the Participant's Final Average Compensation shall be equal to his
annual base compensation immediately prior to his Disability plus the average of
his AIP earned during the three (3) years  immediately prior to the commencement
of his Disability.

                d.  Pre-Retirement Death Benefit. If a Participant dies before
his employment by the Corporation terminates and qualifies as a Vested
Participant on his date of death, his designated beneficiary(ies), or his estate
if he has not designated any beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with
procedures established by the Committee, shall receive within ten (10) days of
the Vested Participant's death a death benefit equal to the lump sum present
value of one hundred percent (100%) of the retirement benefit that would have
been payable to the Vested Participant under Sections 4.a. or 4.b. (including
the spousal survivor benefit payable pursuant to Section 4.e. with respect to
any Vested Participant survived by a spouse) if he had retired on the date of
his death. The lump sum present value of the retirement benefit shall be
calculated using: (x) for each Vested Participant who was a Vested Participant
on January 1, 1998, (i) the 83 GAM mortality tables; and (ii) an interest rate
equal to the sum of one-twelfth (1/12th) of each PBGC Interest Rate for the
twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of the Vested Participant's
death; and (y) for each Vested Participant who first became a Vested Participant
after January 1, 1998, (i) the prevailing commissioner's standard mortality
table (described in Section 807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended from time to time) used to determine reserves for group annuity
contracts issued on the date of the Vested Participant's death (without regard
to any other subparagraph for such Section 807(d)(5)) that is prescribed by the
Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service in revenue rulings, notices, or
other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin; and (ii) an interest
rate equal to the Lump Sum Interest Rate as of the date of the Vested
Participant's death. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary,
the lump sum cash value of the benefit described in this Section 4.d. with
respect to each Vested Participant who (A) was a Vested Participant as of
January 1, 1998 and (B) whose employment with the Corporation terminated due to
his or her death on or after January 1, 2002, shall be equal to the greater of
the value of the lump sum cash payment calculated pursuant to the rates and
factors set forth in subsections (x) or (y) of this paragraph.

                e.  Post-Retirement Death Benefit. If a Vested Participant who
is receiving monthly retirement benefits under this Plan following his
termination of employment by the Corporation dies, his surviving spouse, if he
is survived by a spouse, shall be entitled to receive a death benefit which
shall be a monthly payment for the spouse's life, beginning on the first day of
the month following the Vested Participant's death, equal to:

                    (1)   fifty  percent  (50%) of the  monthly  retirement
         benefit  to which the Vested Participant was entitled under the Plan
         prior to his death;

                    reduced by:

                                      -6-
<PAGE>


                    (2) the monthly annuity value of any life insurance provided
         by the Corporation or any affiliate thereof for retired employees that
         is in excess of  post-retirement  group term life insurance  regularly
         provided by the Corporation or any affiliate thereof.

         5.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN. The Committee is charged with the
administration  of the Plan.  It shall have full power and authority to construe
and interpret the Plan. Its decisions shall be final,  conclusive and binding on
all parties.  Subject to Section 10 of this Plan, the Committee  shall also have
the  power,  in its sole  discretion,  at any time (i) to waive,  in whole or in
part, application of any of the eligibility  requirements of Section 3 or of the
benefit  reduction  factors in Sections  4.a. and 4.b. and (ii) to determine the
timing  and form of payment of any  benefit  under the Plan,  in the case of any
individual Participant,  Vested Participant or other employee of the Corporation
who has participated in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP.

         6.  OPTIONAL  FORMS  OF  PAYMENT.  In lieu  of the  monthly  retirement
benefit (including the spousal survivor benefit payable pursuant to Section 4.e.
hereof) payable pursuant to Section 4.a. or 4.b. hereof to a Vested  Participant
(and his surviving  spouse) who retires (or whose employment is terminated other
than  for  Cause)  after  August  2,  1994  (such  benefit  payable  to a Vested
Participant  and/or his surviving  spouse is herein  referred to for purposes of
this Section 6 as the "Applicable Retirement Benefit"),  such Vested Participant
may elect to receive the following form of benefit payment:

                A lump sum cash payment, payable to the Vested Participant
within ten (10) days after the Vested Participant's date of retirement (or the
Vested Participant's date of termination of employment other than for Cause),

calculated using: (x) for each Vested Participant who was a Vested Participant
on January 1, 1998, (i) the 83 GAM mortality tables; and (ii) an interest rate
equal to one-twelfth (1/12th) of each PBGC Interest Rate for the twelve (12)
months immediately preceding the date of the Vested Participant's retirement (or
the Vested Participant's date of termination of employment other than for
Cause), calculated in accordance with the Corporation's practices for
determining retirement benefits; and (y) for each Vested Participant who first
became a Vested Participant after January 1, 1998 (i) the prevailing
commissioner's standard mortality table (described in Section 807(d)(5)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time) used to
determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date of the Vested
Participant's retirement (or the Vested Participant's date of termination of
employment other than for Cause) (without regard to any other subparagraph of
such Section 807(d)(5)) that is prescribed by the Commissioner of the Internal
Revenue Service in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the

value of the Applicable Retirement Benefit for each Vested Participant who (A)
was a Vested Participant as of January 1, 1998 and (B) whose employment with the
Corporation terminated on or after January 1, 2002, shall be equal to the
greater of the value of the lump sum cash payment calculated pursuant to the
rates and factors set forth in subsections (x) or (y) of this paragraph.

             Any such election must be made by those Participants
designated by the Committee from time to time at least two (2) years and by all
other Participants at least one (1) year prior to the date that the Applicable
Retirement Benefit payments would otherwise become payable. Notwithstanding
anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, any Vested Participant who
was eligible for enhanced benefits under the ERP and terminates his or her
employment with the Corporation under the terms and conditions of the ERP,
shall, with the Committee's approval, be allowed to make such election at any
time prior to the date that his or her Applicable Retirement Benefit payment
would otherwise be payable.

referred to for purposes of this Section 7.a. as the "Future Retirement
Benefit"), a lump sum cash payment, payable to the SERP Recipient, as
applicable, within ten (10) days after a Change in Control (or such later date
that is forty-five (45) days after the notice required by the following
provisions of this Section 7.a. is provided to the applicable SERP Recipient),
equal to the actuarial present value of his Future Retirement Benefit,
calculated using: (x) for each SERP Recipient who was (or whose benefit is
applicable to a Vested Participant who was) a Vested Participant on January 1,
1998, (i) the 83 GAM mortality tables; and (ii) an interest rate equal to the
PBGC Interest Rate as of the date of the Change in Control; and (y) for each
SERP Recipient who first became (or whose benefit is the result of a Vested
Participant who first became) a Vested Participant after January 1, 1998, (i)
the prevailing commissioner's standard mortality table (described in Section
807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time)
used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date of the
Change in Control (without regard to any other subparagraph for such Section
807(d)(5)) that is prescribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue
Service in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin; and (ii) an interest rate equal to the Lump Sum Interest Rate
as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything in this
paragraph to the contrary, the lump sum cash value of the benefit described in
this Section 7.a. for each SERP Recipient who was, or whose benefit is
applicable to a Vested Participant who (A) was a Vested Participant as of
January 1, 1998 and (B) whose employment with the Corporation terminated on or
after January 1, 2002, shall be equal to the greater of the value of the lump
sum cash payment calculated pursuant to the rates and factors set forth in
subsections (x) or (y) of this paragraph.

             Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section
7.a. shall not apply with respect to a SERP Recipient unless such SERP Recipient
consents to the application of this Section 7.a. within thirty (30) days after
the date the SERP Recipient receives written notice of the terms of this Section
7.a., as provided for by the following sentences. The Corporation shall provide
each SERP Recipient with a written notice of the terms of this

                                      -8-

Section 7.a. and the consent  requirement  contained  herein not later than five
(5) days after the earliest of (y) the date that the Corporation provides notice
to its stockholders  that a vote on a transaction  which, if consummated,  would
constitute  a  Change  in  Control  will  be  submitted  to  the   Corporation's
stockholders for approval, or (z) the occurrence of a Change in Control.

                b.  For purposes of Sections 7 and 10, a "Change in Control"
means:

                    (1)   Individuals who, on June 8, 1999, constitute the
         Board (the "Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason to constitute at
         least a majority of the Board, provided that any person becoming a
         director subsequent to June 8, 1999, whose election or nomination for
         election was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
         Incumbent Directors then on the Board (either by specific vote or by
         approval of the proxy statement of the Corporation in which such person
         is named as nominee for director, without written objection to such
         nomination) shall be an Incumbent Director; provided, however, that no
         individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the
         Corporation as a result of an actual or threatened election contest (as
         described in Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange Act) ("Election Contest")
         or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or
         on behalf of any Person other than the Board ("Proxy Contest"),
         including by reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
         Election Contest or Proxy Contest, shall be deemed an Incumbent
         Director; and provided further, however, that a director who has been
         approved by the Hershey Trust while it beneficially owns more than 50%
         of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
         of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
         directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Power") shall be deemed to
         be an Incumbent Director;

                    (2)   The acquisition or holding by any Person of
         beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the
         Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of
         shares of the Common Stock and/or the Class B Common Stock of the
         Corporation representing 25% or more of either (i) the total number of
         then outstanding shares of both Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
         of the Corporation (the "Outstanding Company Stock") or (ii) the
         Outstanding Company Voting Power; provided that, at the time of such
         acquisition or holding of beneficial ownership of any such shares, the
         Hershey Trust does not beneficially own more than 50% of the
         Outstanding Company Voting Power; and provided, further, that any such
         acquisition or holding of beneficial ownership of shares of either
         Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the Corporation by any of the
         following entities shall not by itself constitute such a Change in
         Control hereunder: (i) the Hershey Trust; (ii) any trust established by
         the Corporation or by any Subsidiary for the benefit of the Corporation
         and/or its employees or those of a Subsidiary; (iii) any employee
         benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the
         Corporation or any Subsidiary; (iv) the Corporation or any Subsidiary
         or (v) any underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an
         offering of such securities;

                    (3)   The approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of
         any merger, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or other
         form of business

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

        combination (a "Business  Combination") if, following  consummation of
        such BusinessCombination,  the Hershey Trust does not beneficially own
        more  than 50% of the total  voting  power of all  outstanding  voting
        securities  eligible to elect directors of (x) the surviving entity or
        entities  (the  "Surviving  Corporation")  or (y) if  applicable,  the
        ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial
        ownership  of more than 50% of the  combined  voting power of the then
        outstanding  voting  securities  eligible  to elect  directors  of the
        Surviving Corporation; or

                    (4)   The approval by the stockholders of the
         Corporation of (i) any sale or other disposition of all or
         substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, other than to a
         corporation (the "Acquiring Corporation") if, following consummation of
         such sale or other disposition, the Hershey Trust beneficially owns
         more than 50% of the total voting power of all outstanding voting
         securities eligible to elect directors (x) of the Acquiring Corporation
         or (y) if applicable, the ultimate parent corporation that directly or
         indirectly has beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the combined
         voting power of the then outstanding voting securities eligible to
         elect directors of the Acquiring Corporation, or (ii) a liquidation or
         dissolution of the Corporation.

                c.  For purposes of Sections 7 and 10, a "Potential Change in
Control" means:

                    (1)   The Hershey Trust by action of any of the Board
         of Directors of Hershey Trust Company; the Board of Managers of Milton
         Hershey School; the Investment Committee of the Hershey Trust; and/or
         any of the officers of Hershey Trust Company or Milton Hershey School
         (acting with authority) undertakes consideration of any action the
         taking of which would lead to a Change in Control as defined herein,
         including, but not limited to consideration of (i) an offer made to the
         Hershey Trust to purchase any number of its shares in the Corporation
         such that if the Hershey Trust accepted such offer and sold such number
         of shares in the Corporation the Hershey Trust might no longer have
         more than 50% of the Outstanding Company Voting Power, (ii) an offering
         by the Hershey Trust of any number of its shares in the Corporation for
         sale such that if such sale were consummated the Hershey Trust might no
         longer have more than 50% of the Outstanding Company Voting Power or
         (iii) entering into any agreement or understanding with a person or
         entity that would lead to a Change in Control; or

                    (2)   the Board approves a transaction described in
         subsection (2), (3) or (4) of the definition of a Change in Control
         contained in Section 7.b.

                d.  For purposes of this Section 7: (i) "Hershey Trust" means
either or both of (a) the Hershey Trust Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, as
Trustee for the Milton Hershey School, or any successor to the Hershey Trust
Company as such trustee, and (b) the Milton Hershey School, a Pennsylvania
not-for-profit corporation; (ii) "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii)
"Person" shall have the meaning given in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act, as
modified and used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d) thereof; and (iv) "Subsidiary"

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

mean any corporation controlled by the Corporation, directly or indirectly.

         8.     PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. Nothing contained in the Plan and no action
taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall create or be construed to
create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation
and any Participant, Vested Participant, spouse of a Participant or Vested
Participant, or any other person. No person other than the Corporation shall by
virtue of the provisions of the Plan have any interest in such assets. To the
extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Corporation
under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured
general creditor of the Corporation. The right of any Vested Participant or any
other person to the payment of benefits under the Plan shall not be assigned,
transferred, pledged or encumbered; such payments and the right thereto are
expressly declared to be non-assignable and nontransferable. No payments
hereunder shall be subject to the claim of the creditors of any Vested
Participant or of any other person entitled to payments hereunder. Any payments
required to be made pursuant to the Plan to a person who is under a legal
disability may be made by the Corporation to or for the benefit of such person
in such of the following ways as the Committee shall determine:

                a.    directly to such person.
                b.    to the legal representative of such person.
                c.    to a near relative of such person to be used for such
                      person's benefit.
                d.    directly in payment of expenses of support, maintenance or
                      education of such person.

                The Corporation shall not be required to see to the
application by any third party of any payments made pursuant to the Plan.

         9.     EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN. This Amended and Restated (2002)
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan shall be effective January 1, 2002 and
Vested Participants who become eligible to retire under the Plan on or after
that date shall be entitled to the benefits provided hereunder.

         10.    AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation may, at any time, suspend or terminate the Plan.
The Board, or its duly appointed delegee, if applicable, may also from time to
time, amend the Plan in such respects as it may deem advisable in order that
benefits provided hereunder may conform to any change in law or in other
respects which the Board, or its delegee in accordance with the Board's
delegation of authority thereto, deems to be in the best interest of the
Corporation. No such suspension, termination or amendment of the Plan shall
adversely affect any right of any person who is a Vested Participant at the time
of such suspension, termination or amendment or his beneficiary(ies), estate or
surviving spouse, as applicable, to receive benefits under the Plan in
accordance with its provisions in effect immediately prior to such suspension,
termination or amendment without the consent of such Vested Participant,
beneficiary(ies), estate or surviving spouse. Any benefits payable under the
terms of the Plan at the time of any suspension, termination or amendment of the
Plan shall remain in effect according to their original terms, or such alternate
terms as may be in the best interests of both parties and

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

agreed to by the Vested  Participant or his  beneficiaries,  estate or surviving
spouse, as applicable.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  (a) the Plan may not be
terminated  or  amended in any manner  that is  adverse  to the  interests  of a
Participant or the surviving spouse of a Participant  without the consent of the
Participant or surviving  spouse, as applicable,  either:  (i) after a Potential
Change in Control  occurs and for one (1) year  following  the  cessation of the
Potential Change in Control,  or (ii) for a two (2) year period beginning on the
date of a Change in Control (the "Coverage  Period");  and (b) no termination of
this  Plan or  amendment  hereof in a manner  adverse  to the  interests  of any
Participant, or such Participant's surviving spouse, (without the consent of the
Participant  or surviving  spouse)  shall be effective  if such  termination  or
amendment  occurs  (i) at the  request  of a third  party  who has  taken  steps
reasonably  calculated to effect a Change of Control, or (ii) in connection with
or in anticipation of a Change of Control.  After the Coverage Period,  the Plan
may not be amended or terminated in any manner that would  adversely  affect the
entitlement of a Participant or his surviving spouse (without the consent of the
Participant or surviving  spouse) to benefits that have accrued  hereunder.  For
purposes of the immediately  preceding two sentences of this Section 10, whether
an employee of the Corporation qualifies as a Participant shall be determined at
the time (a) the Coverage  Period  commences and any time  thereafter or (b) his
employment  is  terminated  or the Plan is amended (i) at the request of a third
party who has taken steps  reasonably  calculated to effect a Change of Control,
or (ii) in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Hershey Foods Corporation has caused this Hershey
Foods Corporation Amended and Restated (2002) Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan to be executed as of the 19th day of August, 2002.

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION
                       EXECUTIVE BENEFITS PROTECTION PLAN
                                   (GROUP 3A)


         The Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits Protection Plan (Group
3A),  as set forth  herein,  is intended  to help  attract and retain  qualified
management  employees and maintain a stable work environment by making provision
for the protection of covered  employees in connection  with a Change in Control
or Termination Without Cause as set forth herein.


                                    ARTICLE 1
                                   DEFINITIONS

         As hereinafter  used,  the following  words shall have the meanings set
forth below.

         1.1   AIP means the Annual  Incentive  Program  under the KEIP and
annual  (but  not  quarterly)  incentives  awarded  under  the  Company's  Sales
Incentive Plan and any successor or replacement plan thereof.

         1.2   ANNUAL BASE SALARY  means with respect to an Executive the higher
of:

               1.2.1   his highest annual base salary in effect during the
one (1) year period preceding a Change in Control; or

               1.2.2   his highest  annual base salary in effect during the
one year period preceding his Date of Termination.

         For purposes of the foregoing,  salary reduction  elections pursuant to
Sections 125 and 401(k) of the Code shall not be taken into account.

         1.3   ANNUAL BONUS  means with respect to an Executive the highest of:

               1.3.1   the  average  of the  three  highest  bonuses  paid  or
payable,  including  any bonus or  portion  thereof  which has been  earned  but
deferred,  to him by the  Company in respect of the five  fiscal  years (or such
shorter  period  during which he has been employed by the Company or eligible to
receive  any bonus  payment)  immediately  preceding  the fiscal year in which a
Change in Control  occurs  (annualized  for any fiscal  year  during such period
consisting  of less than twelve full months or with respect to which he has been
employed by the Company or eligible to receive a bonus for less than twelve full
months);

               1.3.2   the  bonus  paid or  payable  (annualized  as  described
above),  including  any  bonus or  portion  thereof  which has been  earned  but
deferred, to him by the Company in respect of the most recently completed fiscal
year prior to the Change in Control;

<PAGE>


               1.3.3   the  bonus  paid or  payable  (annualized  as  described
above),  including  any  bonus or  portion  thereof  which  has been  earned  or
deferred,  for the most  recently  completed  fiscal year  preceding his Date of
Termination; and

               1.3.4   his  100%  target  bonus  award  amount  for  the  year
including his Date of Termination.

         For purposes  herein,  only payments under the AIP, as well as payments
under any successor or replacement  substitute  plan,  shall be treated as bonus
payments.

         1.4   BASE AMOUNT  shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in
Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code.

         1.5   BOARD  means the Board of Directors of the Company.

         1.6   CAUSE  means with respect to an Executive:

               1.6.1   his  willful  and  continued  failure  to  substantially
perform his duties with the Company (other than any such failure  resulting from
incapacity  due to  physical  or mental  illness),  after a written  demand  for
substantial  performance is delivered to him by the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company  which  specifically  identifies  the manner in which the
Board  or  Chief  Executive   Officer   believes  that  the  Executive  has  not
substantially performed his duties; or

               1.6.2   his  willfully  engaging  in  illegal  conduct  or gross
misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.

         For purposes of this Section 1.6, no act or failure to act, on the part
of an Executive, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be
done,  by him in bad faith and  without  reasonable  belief  that his  action or
omission was in the best  interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act,
based upon prior approval given by the Board or upon the instruction or with the
approval of the Chief Executive Officer or an Executive's superior or based upon
the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done,
or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best  interests
of the Company.  The cessation of employment of an Executive shall not be deemed
to be for Cause  unless and until there shall have been  delivered to him a copy
of a  resolution  duly  adopted  by  the  affirmative  vote  of  not  less  than
three-quarters  of the entire  membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to him and
he is given an  opportunity,  together  with  counsel,  to be heard  before  the
Board),  finding that,  in the good faith opinion of the Board,  he is guilty of

the Change in Control,  he elects, in his sole discretion,  to receive such lump
sum cash payment at such time.

purposes  of only  Section 3 of the SERP (and not for the  purposes of any other
provision of the SERP,  including but not limited to Section  4.a(1) and Section

the  excess,  if any,  of ten (10) over his  actual  number of Years of  Service
(including fractions thereof) completed as of the date of the Change in Control;
(iii) he shall be deemed for the  purposes of Section 3 of the SERP (and not for
the  purposes  of any  other  provision  of the  SERP) to have five (5) years of
participation in the performance  share unit portion of the KEIP during his last
ten (10) years of employment with the Company  regardless of his actual years of

years (or such  lesser  number  of years  (including  fractions)  until he would
attain Mandatory Retirement Age if applicable to him) and for purposes of clause
(D) of  Section  4.b(2) of the  SERP,  he shall be deemed to have as his date of
termination  of  employment  the date three  years  after the date the Change in
Control

                                      11

occurs;  (v) he shall be deemed to have been paid his  Annual  Base  Salary  for
three (3) additional years (or such lesser number of years (including fractions)
until he would attain Mandatory Retirement Age if applicable to him) which shall
be  considered  to have been earned over such period of time during his last ten
(10) years of  employment  with the Company for purposes of  calculating  "Final
Average  Compensation"  in Section 2.f. of the SERP;  (vi) he shall be deemed to
have been paid his Annual Bonus for three (3)  additional  years (or such lesser
number of years (including fractions) until he would attain Mandatory Retirement
Age if applicable to him) which,  together with his Vested  Current Bonus Amount
as determined  pursuant to Section 2.1.1 shall be considered his AIP awards paid
or accrued with  respect to the last four  consecutive  calendar  years (or such
lesser number of calendar years (including  fractions) as appropriate if limited
by his  Mandatory  Retirement  Age) during his last ten (10) years of employment
with the Company for purposes of  calculating  "Final Average  Compensation"  in
Section 2.f of the SERP;  (vii) for the purposes of Section 2.f of the SERP (and

Vested Current Bonus Amount plus the number of years with respect to which he is
deemed to have been paid his Annual  Bonus as  provided  in  Subsection  2.3.1.1
(vi)) for five (5)  consecutive  years in his last ten (10) years of  employment
with the Company, he shall have his highest annual average AIP award be based on
the  average  of his AIP awards  paid or  accrued  over the sum of the number of
years  preceding the year during which the Change in Control occurs during which
he has participated in the AIP portion of the KEIP plus the number of years with
respect to which he is deemed to have been paid his Annual  Bonus as provided in
Subsection  2.3.1.1 (vi) plus the year during which the Change in Control occurs
with  respect  to  which he is  entitled  to his  Vested  Current  Bonus  Amount

at the time of the Change in Control and  regardless of the number of years such
Executive has been employed by the Company at the time of the Change in Control;
and (viii) for purposes of Section 4.b(2)(B) of the SERP,  provided an Executive
has at least one (1) Year of Service  under the Hershey  Pension  Plan as of the
date of the Change in  Control,  he shall be deemed to be vested in his  accrued
benefit  under the Hershey  Pension Plan as of the date of the Change in Control
regardless  of whether he is  actually  vested in such  accrued  benefit on such
date;

                       2.3.1.2  if such  Executive has not yet attained age
fifty-five (55) (after  increasing his age by three (3) years as provided in the
preceding  Subsection  2.3.1.1),  he shall, upon the occurrence of the Change in
Control be deemed  nevertheless to have attained age fifty-five (55);  provided,
however,  the reduction factor prescribed by clause (D) of Section 4.b(2) of the
SERP shall still be given effect in calculating  his SERP Benefit,  with his age
being  increased by three (3) years as provided in  Subsection  2.3.1.1  hereof;
provided,  further,  that (i) for an Executive  (other than the Chief  Executive
Officer  of the  Company)  who has not  yet  attained  age  fifty  (50)  (before
increasing  his age by three (3) years as provided in the  preceding  Subsection
2.3.1.1) as of the date the Change in Control  occurs,  the reduction  factor in
clause  (D) of  Section  4.b(2)  of the SERP  shall be  based on the  number  of
complete calendar months by which the date the Change in Control occurs precedes
his fifty-second (52nd) birthday and (ii) for an Executive (other than the Chief
Executive  Officer of the  Company)  who has  attained  age fifty  (50)  (before
increasing  his age by three (3) years as provided in the  preceding  Subsection
2.3.1.1) as of the

                                      12
<PAGE>


date the Change in Control occurs, the reduction factor in clause (D) of Section
4.b(2) of the SERP shall be zero percent (0%).

                       2.3.1.3  the actuarial  present value of such Executive's
SERP Benefit, as determined in accordance with the foregoing  provisions of this
Section 2.3, shall be determined  using:  (i) the 83 GAM mortality table blended
50/50 for males and females; (ii) an interest rate equal to 100% of the interest
rate that would be used (as of the date of the Change in Control) by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty  Corporation for purposes of determining the present value of a
lump sum  distribution  on plan  termination;  (iii)  the date of the  Change in
Control  as the date on which  payment  of the  Executive's  SERP  Benefit is to
commence and as the date as of which the  actuarial  present  value of such SERP
Benefit is  calculated;  and (iv) the actual age of the Executive and his spouse
(without regard to any adjustments made pursuant to Sections 2.3.1.1 or 2.3.1.2)
as of the date of the Change in Control.

               2.3.2   each  Executive who neither is a participant in the SERP
on the date of the Change in Control  nor was a  participant  in the SERP on the
date of the  Potential  Change in Control  preceding the Change in Control shall
have a vested and  nonforfeitable  right  hereunder to receive in cash an amount
equal to the sum of:

                       2.3.2.1   a lump sum cash amount  equal to the  actuarial
equivalent of the excess of (x) the retirement pension (determined as a straight
life  annuity  commencing  at Normal  Retirement  Age, as defined in the Hershey
Pension Plan) which he would have accrued under the terms of the Hershey Pension
Plan (as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control), determined as if
he were fully vested  thereunder and had accumulated  thirty-six (36) additional
months of service  credit  thereunder  during each of which he will be deemed to
have been paid  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of the sum of his  highest  annual rate of
compensation as an employee of the Company and his Annual Bonus (but in no event
shall he be deemed to have accumulated additional months of service credit after
he would have attained  Mandatory  Retirement  Age, if applicable)  over (y) the
retirement  pension  (determined as a straight life annuity commencing at Normal
Retirement  Age)  which he has  accrued  pursuant  to the  terms of the  Hershey
Pension Plan as of the date of the Change in Control; and

                       2.3.2.2  if he is a participant in the CLRP, a lump sum
cash amount ("CLRP Benefit") equal to his Excess Account, as defined in the CLRP
(as in effect  immediately  prior to the Change in Control)  determined as if he
were fully vested  thereunder and had  accumulated  thirty-six  (36)  additional
months of service  credit  thereunder  during each of which he will be deemed to
have been paid  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of the sum of his  highest  annual rate of
compensation as an employee of the Company and his Annual Bonus, but in no event
shall he be deemed to have accumulated additional months of service credit after
he would have attained  Mandatory  Retirement Age, if applicable (the sum of the
amounts  described in Subsections  2.3.2.1 and 2.3.2.2 is herein  referred to as
such  Executive's  "Vested Pension  Benefit" and the Vested Pension Benefit plus
all, if any, investment credit applied thereto in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.5 hereof is herein referred to as such Executive's  "Vested Pension
Amount").

                                      13
<PAGE>


         For purposes of this Subsection 2.3.2,  "actuarial  equivalent" amounts
shall be determined using the same methods and assumptions  prescribed under the
Hershey Pension Plan immediately prior to the Change in Control.

         2.4   PAYMENT OF VESTED PENSION AMOUNT UPON TIMELY ELECTION. The
Company  shall,  on the later of (i) the first day of  January of the year first
following  the year  during  which the  Change in  Control  occurs  and (ii) the
one-hundred  twentieth (120th) day following the Change in Control,  pay to each
Executive  a lump sum cash  payment  equal to his  Vested  Pension  Amount  plus
interest thereon at the rate provided in Section  1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from
the date of the Change in Control to the date of payment if, prior to the Change
in Control,  he elects,  in his sole  discretion,  to receive such lump sum cash
payment at such time.

         2.5   CONVERSION  OF  VESTED   PENSION   BENEFIT  TO  DEFERRED
COMPENSATION  PLAN ACCOUNT IN ABSENCE OF SECTION 2.4 ELECTION.  In the event the
Executive  makes no election  under  Section 2.4 hereof,  an amount equal to his
Vested Pension Benefit shall be credited to him under the Deferred  Compensation
Plan and subject to the provisions of this Subsection 2.5, the provisions of the
Deferred Compensation Plan shall apply thereto as if such amount were a Deferred
AIP Award.  Within ten (10) days of the Change in Control  the  Executive  shall
select one or more  Investment  Options as defined in the Deferred  Compensation
Plan to be effective  with respect to such amount and  thereafter may change his
selection of such  Investment  Options in accordance  with the provisions of the
Deferred Compensation Plan. Investment credits shall be applied to the amount of
his Vested  Pension  Benefit in accordance  with the  provisions of the Deferred
Compensation  Plan from the date of the Change in Control to the date of payment
to the Executive in accordance with his selection of such Investment Options. If
the Executive makes no election under Section 2.4 hereof and does not select one
or more Investment  Options as defined in the Deferred  Compensation Plan within
ten (10) days of the Change in Control in accordance  with the provisions of the
second sentence of this Section 2.5,  investment credits shall be applied to the
amount of his Vested  Pension  Benefit from the date of the Change in Control to
the earlier of the date he makes a selection of Investment  Options with respect
thereto in accordance with the provisions of the Deferred  Compensation Plan and
the date of payment in accordance  with the latest of his  pre-Change in Control
selections of Investment Options relating to his Deferred AIP Awards or Deferred
PSU Awards,  if any. If there are no such  pre-Change  in Control  selections of
Investment Options,  then investment credits shall be applied in accordance with
the  provisions of the  immediately  preceding  sentence by treating the Hershey
Fixed Income Fund Investment Option under the Deferred  Compensation Plan as his
latest  pre-Change in Control selection of Investment  Options.  Within ten (10)
days of the Change in Control the Executive shall make a Deferral  Election with
respect to his Vested Pension  Amount.  If the Executive makes no election under
Section  2.4 hereof and makes no Deferral  Election  within ten (10) days of the
Change in Control in accordance with the immediately  preceding  sentence,  then
for purposes hereof he will be considered to have made a Deferral Election under
the Deferred  Compensation  Plan to have his Vested  Pension Amount paid to him,
his designated  beneficiaries or his estate,  as applicable,  in accordance with
the latest of his  pre-Change  in Control  Deferral  Elections  relating  to his
Deferred  AIP  Awards  or  Deferred  PSU  Awards,  if any.  If there are no such
pre-Change in Control  Deferral  Elections,  then for purposes hereof he will be
considered to have made a Deferral Election under the Deferred Compensation Plan
to have his Vested Pension

                                      14
<PAGE>


Amount paid to him, his designated  beneficiaries or his estate,  as applicable,
on the first day of the month  following  his  termination  of employment by the
Company.  His Vested Pension Amount shall be paid to him in accordance  with the
Deferral Election described in the preceding three sentences, as applicable,  or
any subsequent  Deferral  Election with respect thereto  permitted in accordance
with the provisions of the Deferred Compensation Plan.

         2.6   SERP OR CLRP AMENDMENTS.  Notwithstanding any provision of
the SERP,  CLRP,  or Deferred  Compensation  Plan,  none of the SERP,  CLRP,  or
Deferred  Compensation  Plan may be  terminated or amended in any manner that is
adverse to the interests of any Executive without his consent either:  (i) after
a  Potential  Change  in  Control  occurs  and for one (1)  year  following  the
cessation of the Potential Change in Control, or (ii) after a Change in Control.
Any termination or amendment of the SERP, CLRP, or Deferred Compensation Plan in
a manner adverse to the interests of an Executive within one (1) year prior to a
Potential  Change in Control  shall not be given  effect for purposes of Section
2.3 or Section 2.5 hereof.

         2.7   OTHER PSU GRANTS OUTSTANDING AS OF THE DATE OF A CHANGE IN
CONTROL.  An Executive shall be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment with
respect to each  contingent  target PSU grant that is outstanding as of the date
of a Change in Control (and that is not  otherwise  paid out in whole or in part
in  accordance  with the terms of  Article 2 or  Article 3 hereof)  in an amount
equal to the 100% target award amount of each such  contingent  target PSU grant
valued at the higher of (i) the  Transaction  Value and (ii) the highest Closing
price of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange from the date
of the Change in  Control  until the end of the cycle,  provided  the  Executive
continues  to be employed by the Company  through the end of such cycle.  In the
event an Executive  continues to be employed by the Company after  expiration of
the Coverage Period but such Executive's employment is terminated by the Company
without  Cause,  by the  Executive  for Good  Reason  or  terminates  due to the
Executive's death, Disability or retirement (on or after the date such Executive
attains Mandatory Retirement Age) prior to the end of any applicable  contingent
target PSU cycle,  such  Executive (or his estate,  as the case may be) shall be
entitled  to receive a lump sum cash  payment  with  respect to each  contingent
target PSU grant that is  outstanding as of the date of a Change in Control (and
that has not otherwise been paid out in whole or in part in accordance  with the
terms of  Article 2 or  Article 3 hereof)  in an amount  equal to the sum of the
product of (x) and (y),  where (x) is an amount  equal to the 100% target  award
amount of each such contingent  target PSU grant valued at the higher of (i) the
Transaction  Value and (ii) the highest  closing price of the  Company's  Common
Stock on the New York  Stock  Exchange  from the date of the  Change in  Control
until the Date of  Termination,  and (y) is a fraction the numerator of which is
the  number  of days  from and  including  the  first  day of the  award  period
applicable  to such  outstanding  contingent  target PSU grant that includes the
Executive's  Date of Termination  until (and  including) his Date of Termination
and  the  denominator  of  which  is the  number  of days  in the  award  period
applicable to such outstanding contingent target PSU grant. The payment provided
for in this  Section 2.7 with respect to each such  contingent  target PSU grant
shall be made to an  Executive  by the fifth  (5th) day  following  the first to
occur of (a) the end of the cycle of such grant and (b) the Executive's  Date of
Termination.

         3.2   SEVERANCE  BENEFITS.  In addition to the payments provided for by
Section  3.1  hereof,  the  Company  shall pay or  provide to an  Executive  the
payments,  benefits,  and services  described in Subsections 3.2.1 through 3.2.6
below (the  "Severance  Benefits")  in  accordance  with such  Subsections  upon
termination of his employment  with the Company during the Coverage  Period,  if
his  termination  of  employment  either (i) is a Section  1.39  Termination  of
Employment,  or (ii) is (a) not by the Company  for Cause,  (b) not by reason of
his death or Disability or after his Mandatory  Retirement  Age, if  applicable,
and (c) not by him without Good Reason.

               3.2.1   LUMP-SUM  SEVERANCE  PAYMENT.  In lieu  of any  further
salary payments to him for periods  subsequent to the Date of  Termination,  the
Company shall pay to him a lump sum severance  payment,  in cash, equal to three
(3) (or, if less,  the number of years,  including  fractions,  from the Date of
Termination until he would have reached Mandatory Retirement Age, if applicable)
times the sum of (a), (b) and (c) where (a) equals his Annual Base  Salary,  (b)
equals his Annual Bonus and (c) equals his Highest PSU Amount.

               3.2.2   CONTINUED  BENEFITS.  For a thirty-six (36) month period
(or, if less, the number of months from the Date of  Termination  until he would
have  reached  Mandatory  Retirement  Age,  if  applicable)  after  the  Date of
Termination, the Company shall provide him with life insurance, health and other
welfare benefits ("Welfare Benefits")  substantially  similar in all respects to
those which he was receiving  immediately  prior to the Notice of Termination on
substantially the same terms and conditions,  including  contributions  required
from him for such  benefits  (without  giving  effect to any  reduction  in such
benefits  subsequent to the Potential Change in Control  preceding the Change in
Control or the Change in Control,  which reduction constitutes or may constitute
Good Reason);  provided that if he cannot continue to participate in the Company
plans  providing  Welfare  Benefits,  the Company shall  otherwise  provide such
benefits on the same  after-tax  basis as if  continued  participation  had been
permitted.  The  Executive  shall be  entitled  to elect to change  his level of
coverage and/or his choice of coverage options (such as Executive only or family
medical  coverage)  with  respect to the Welfare  Benefits to be provided by the
Company to him to the same  extent  that  actively  employed  executives  of the
Company are permitted to make such changes; provided, however, that in the event
of any such  changes  he shall pay the  amount of any cost  increase  that would
actually be paid by an actively  employed  executive of the Company by reason of
such actively employed  executive making the same change in level of coverage or
coverage options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive
becomes reemployed with another employer and becomes eligible to receive welfare
benefits from such  employer,  the Welfare  Benefits  described  herein shall be
secondary to such benefits,  but only to the extent that the Company  reimburses
him for any increased  cost and provides any  additional  benefits  necessary to
give him the Welfare Benefits provided hereunder.

               3.2.3   OUTSTANDING AWARDS. Except to the extent the Company has
previously  paid or  concurrently  pays to him all or a  portion  of his  Vested
Current Bonus Amount and Vested Current PSU Amount as provided for herein, if an
Executive's Date of Termination  occurs within the Coverage Period,  he shall be
entitled to a lump sum cash payment with respect to each

types of grants under any replacement plans or programs equal to the sum of:

                       3.2.3.1  the sum of the  product  of (x) and (y) for each
then outstanding contingent target PSU grant under the KEIP (or similar types of
grants under any  replacement  plan or program) for the applicable  award period
that includes his Date of Termination,  where (x) is an amount equal to the 100%
target award amount of such outstanding contingent target PSU grant and (y) is a
fraction  the  numerator of which is the number of days from and  including  the
first day of the award period  applicable to such outstanding  contingent target
PSU  grant  that  includes  the  Executive's  Date  of  Termination  until  (and
including) his Date of Termination and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the award period  applicable to such outstanding  contingent  target PSU
grant; and

                       3.2.3.2  the sum of the product of (x) and (y) for each
then  outstanding  contingent  target  AIP grant  made to him under the KEIP (or
similar  types of  grants  under  any  replacement  plans or  programs)  for the
applicable  award period that includes his Date of Termination,  where (x) is an
amount  equal  to the  greater  of (A) the  100%  target  award  amount  of such
outstanding contingent target AIP grant, and (B) the amount that would have been
payable  to him  under  such  contingent  target  AIP grant as of the end of the
applicable  award period,  calculated  utilizing as the  applicable  performance
factors his and the Company's  actual  performance on an annualized  basis as of
his Date of  Termination,  and (y) is a fraction  the  numerator of which is the
number of days from and including  the first day of the award period  applicable
to such  outstanding  contingent AIP grant that includes his Date of Termination
until (and  including) his Date of Termination  and the  denominator of which is
the number of days in such applicable award period.

Contingent  target PSU grants  under the KEIP or a similar type of grant under a
replacement plan or program shall be valued at the higher of (i) the Transaction
Value and (ii) the highest  closing price of the  Company's  Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange during the period running from the date of the Change in
Control until the Executive's Date of Termination.

               3.2.4   HERSHEY PENSION PLAN AND ESSIOP VESTING. An Executive who
is a participant  in the Hershey  Pension Plan or the Hershey Foods  Corporation
Employee Savings Stock Investment and Ownership Plan (the "ESSIOP") shall, as of
his Date of  Termination,  be fully  vested  in each of his  accounts  under the
Hershey Pension Plan and ESSIOP.  In the event that any amount under the Hershey
Pension Plan and ESSIOP that vests pursuant to the preceding  sentence cannot be
paid to the Executive under the terms of the applicable  plan, the Company shall
pay such amount to the Executive under the terms of this Plan.

               3.2.5   RELOCATION  ALLOWANCE.  In the event that an  Executive
relocates  following his Date of Termination  and during the Coverage  Period at
the request of a successor  employer,  the Company shall pay to him a relocation
allowance of $75,000; provided,  however, that any such payment shall be reduced
by any payments received by him from such successor  employer for the purpose of
reimbursing  him for  costs  of  relocation.  The  Company  shall  pay him  such
relocation allowance within five (5) business days after delivery of his written
request and may

                                      18
<PAGE>


condition the payment of the  relocation  allowance upon his agreeing in writing
to report to the Company  any such  payments  from any  successor  employer  and
agreeing in writing to  reimburse to the Company any amounts  received  from the
Company pursuant to this Subsection 3.2.5 that should have been so reduced.

               3.2.6   OUTPLACEMENT  SERVICES. If an Executive becomes eligible
to receive  Severance  Benefits,  such  Employee  shall be  entitled  to receive
outplacement services in accordance with the Corporation's outplacement services
policy (as in effect  immediately  prior to the Change in Control) for up to one
year following the Date of Termination and in an amount not to exceed $35,000.

         3.3   GROSS-UP  PAYMENT.  In the event that an Executive becomes
entitled to the Severance  Benefits or any other benefits or payments under this
Plan (other than  pursuant to this  Section  3.3),  or the KEIP by reason of the
accelerated   vesting  of  stock  options  thereunder   (together,   the  "Total
Benefits"),  and in the event that any of the Total  Benefits will be subject to
the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to him an additional amount (the "Gross-Up
Payment")  such that the net amount  retained  by him,  after  deduction  of any
Excise Tax on the Total  Benefits and any  federal,  state and local income tax,
Excise Tax and FICA and Medicare withholding taxes upon the payment provided for
by this Section 3.3, shall be equal to the Total Benefits.

         For purposes of  determining  whether any of the Total Benefits will be
subject  to the  Excise Tax and the  amount of such  Excise  Tax,  (i) any other
payments or benefits  received or to be received by an Executive  in  connection
with a Change in Control or his termination of employment  (whether  pursuant to
the terms of this Plan or any other  plan,  arrangement  or  agreement  with the
Company,  any Person whose  actions  result in a Change in Control or any Person
affiliated  with the  Company or such  Person)  shall be  treated  as  parachute
payments  within the meaning of Section  280G(b)(2) of the Code,  and all excess
parachute  payments within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as
subject to the Excise Tax,  unless in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel")
selected by the Company's  independent auditors and acceptable to the Executive,
such  other  payments  or  benefits  (in  whole or in  part)  do not  constitute
parachute  payments,  or such excess  parachute  payments  (in whole or in part)
represent  reasonable  compensation  for services  actually  rendered within the
meaning of Section  280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the Base Amount,  or are
otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax,  (ii) the amount of the Total  Benefits
which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser
of (A) the total  amount of the Total  Benefits  reduced  by the  amount of such
Total Benefits that in the opinion of Tax Counsel are not parachute payments, or
(B) the  amount of excess  parachute  payments  within  the  meaning  of Section
280G(b)(1)  (after  applying  clause  (i),  above),  and  (iii) the value of any
non-cash  benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the
Company's  independent  auditors in accordance  with the  principles of Sections
280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.  For purposes of  determining  the amount of the
Gross-Up  Payment,  an Executive  shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at
the highest  marginal  rate of federal  income  taxation in the calendar year in
which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the
highest  marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of his residence on
the Date of  Termination,  net of the  reduction  in federal  income taxes which
could be obtained from  deduction of such state and local taxes  (calculated  by
assuming  that any  reduction  under  Section  68 of the Code in the  amount  of
itemized deductions  allowable to him applies first

                                      19
<PAGE>


to reduce the amount of such state and local income  taxes that would  otherwise
be deductible by him).

         In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently  determined to be less
than the amount taken into account  hereunder at the time of  termination  of an
Executive's  employment,  he shall  repay to the  Company,  at the time that the
amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the
Gross-Up  Payment  attributable  to such  reduction  (plus  that  portion of the
Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax, federal, state and local income
taxes and FICA and  Medicare  withholding  taxes  imposed on the  portion of the
Gross-Up  Payment being repaid by him to the extent that such repayment  results
in a  reduction  in Excise  Tax,  FICA and  Medicare  withholding  taxes  and/or
federal,  state or local  income  taxes)  plus  interest  on the  amount of such
repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. The Company
may require an Executive to agree in writing to the repayment obligation imposed
by the preceding  sentence as a condition to receiving the Gross-Up Payment.  In
the event  that the  Excise Tax is  determined  to exceed the amount  taken into
account  hereunder at the time of the  termination of an Executive's  employment
(including  by reason of any payment the  existence or amount of which cannot be
determined  at the time of the  Gross-Up  Payment),  the  Company  shall make an
additional  Gross-Up  Payment,  determined  as previously  described,  to him in
respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by him
with  respect  to such  excess)  at the time that the  amount of such  excess is
finally determined.

         3.4   TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  The payments provided for:

               3.4.1   in Subsections 3.1.1, 3.1.3, 3.1.5, 3.2.1 and 3.2.3, and
in Section  3.3 hereof  shall be made to an  Executive  not later than the fifth
(5th) day  following his Date of  Termination;  provided,  however,  that if the
amounts of such payments cannot be finally  determined on or before such day the
Company  shall pay to the  Executive on such day an estimate,  as  determined in
good faith by the Company,  of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay
the remainder of such payments  (together  with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following the Date of
Termination to the payment of such  remainder) as soon as the amount thereof can
be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Date
of Termination.  In the event that the amount of the estimated  payments exceeds
the  amount  subsequently  determined  to  have  been  due,  such  excess  shall
constitute  a loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)
business day after  demand by the Company  (together  with  interest at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following
the Date of Termination to the payment of such remainder);

               3.4.2   in Subsection 3.1.4 hereof shall be made to an Executive
on the later of (i) the first day of  January of the year  first  following  the
year  during  which  his Date of  Termination  occurs  and (ii) the one  hundred
twentieth  (120th) day following his Date of Termination if prior to his Date of
Termination he elects, in his sole discretion,  to receive his previously unpaid
Deferred AIP Awards at such time. In the event the Executive makes such election
and the amount of the payment  described in  Subsection  3.1.4 cannot be finally
determined on or before the later of such one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or
January 1, as  applicable,  the Company  shall pay to the

                                  20
<PAGE>


Executive on such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or January 1, as applicable,
an estimate,  as determined in good faith by the Company,  of the minimum amount
of such  payment and shall pay the  remainder  of such  payment  (together  with
interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from such one
hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  to the payment of
such  remainder) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event
later than the thirtieth (30th) day after such one hundred twentieth (120th) day
or January  1, as  applicable.  In the event  that the  amount of the  estimated
payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess
shall  constitute a loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth
(5th)  business day after demand by the Company  (together  with interest at the
rate  provided  in  Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the  Code  from  the one  hundred
twentieth  (120th)  day  following  the Date of  Termination  or  January  1, as
applicable,  to the payment of such remainder). In the event the Executive makes
no such  election,  his previously  unpaid  Deferred AIP Awards shall be paid in
accordance with each of his applicable Deferral Elections;

               3.4.3   in Subsection 3.1.6 shall be made to an Executive on the
later of (i) the first  day of  January  of the year  first  following  the year
during which his Date of Termination  occurs and (ii) the one hundred  twentieth
(120th)  day  following  his  Date  of  Termination  if  prior  to his  Date  of
Termination he elects, in his sole discretion,  to receive his previously unpaid
Deferred PSU Awards at such time. In the event the Executive makes such election
and the amount of the payment provided for in Subsection 3.1.6 cannot be finally
determined on or before the later of such one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or
January 1, as  applicable,  the Company  shall pay to the  Executive on such one
hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  an  estimate,  as
determined in good faith by the Company,  of the minimum  amount of such payment
and shall pay the remainder of such payment  (together with interest at the rate
provided in Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the Code from such one hundred  twentieth
(120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  to the payment of such  remainder) as
soon as the amount  thereof  can be  determined  but in no event  later than the
thirtieth  (30th) day after such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or January 1,
as applicable. In the event that the amount of the estimated payment exceeds the
amount subsequently  determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)  business day
after  demand by the Company  (together  with  interest at the rate  provided in
Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the Code from the one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day
following the Date of Termination or January 1, as applicable, to the payment of
such  remainder).  In the  event  the  Executive  makes  no such  election,  his
previously  unpaid  Deferred PSU Awards shall be paid in accordance with each of
his applicable Deferral Elections; and

               3.4.4   in Subsection 3.1.7 shall be made to him on the later of
(i) the first day of January  following his Date of Termination and (ii) the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day following his Date of Termination if, prior to his
Date of Termination,  he elects, in his sole discretion, to receive such payment
at such time. In the event the Executive makes no such election, then his Vested
Pension Amount shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5.

Executive  all  legal  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by  him as a  result  of a
termination of his employment which entitles him to any payments under this Plan
(including  all such  fees and  expenses,  if any,  incurred  in  contesting  or
disputing  any  Notice of Intent to  Terminate  under  Section  4.3 hereof or in
seeking to obtain or enforce  any right or benefit  provided  by this Plan or in
connection  with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent  attributable  to the
application  of Section  4999 of the Code to any  payment  or  benefit  provided
hereunder).  Such  payments  shall be made within five (5)  business  days after
delivery of his  respective  written  requests for payment  accompanied  by such
evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require.

         3.6   EXECUTIVES' COVENANT.  The Company may condition the payment of

Control, he will remain in the employ of the Company until the earliest of (a) a
date which is nine months  after the date of such  Potential  Change in Control,
(b) the date of a Change  in  Control,  (c) the date of his  termination  of his
employment  for Good Reason  (determined  by treating  the  Potential  Change in
Control for this  purpose as a Change in Control in applying the  definition  of
Good Reason) or by reason of death or  Disability,  (d) the  termination  by the
Company of his  employment  for any reason or (e) his attaining  age  sixty-five
(65).

purported  termination  of an  Executive's  employment  (other than by reason of
death) must be preceded by a written  Notice of Intent to Terminate  from him to
the Company or the Company to him, as  applicable,  in  accordance  with Section

the Executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard
before the Board)  finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board,  he was
guilty of conduct set forth in Subsection 1.6.1 or 1.6.2 herein,  and specifying
the particulars thereof in detail.

         4.2   DATE OF TERMINATION.  Date of Termination, (a) with respect to
any  purported  termination  of an  Executive's  employment  after a  Change  in
Control,  shall mean  (except as  provided  in Section  4.3  hereof)  (i) if his
employment is terminated by reason of his death, his date of death,  (ii) if his
employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Intent

                                      22

performance  of his duties during such thirty (30) day period),  or (iii) if his
employment is terminated for any other reason,  the date specified in the Notice
of Intent to Terminate  (which (x) in the case of a termination  by the Company,
shall not be less than thirty (30) days, except in the case of a termination for
Cause in which case it shall not be less than ten (10) days,  provided  that the
Company  may  require  him to not report to work during such ten (10) day period
and (y) in the case of a  termination  by an  Executive,  shall not be less than
fifteen  (15) days nor more than sixty (60)  days,  respectively,  from the date
such Notice of Intent to  Terminate  is given),  and (b) for purposes of Section
2.3 of this Plan and the definitions of the defined terms Annual Base Salary and
Annual  Bonus as used in such  Section  2.3,  shall  mean  the date a Change  in
Control occurs.

         4.3   DISPUTE CONCERNING  TERMINATION.  If within fifteen (15) days
after any Notice of Intent to Terminate is given  (within  eight (8) days in the
case of a termination for Cause by the Company), or, if later, prior to the Date
of Termination  (as  determined  without regard to this Section 4.3), the person
receiving  such Notice of Intent to Terminate  notifies  the person  giving such
notice that a dispute  exists  concerning  the  termination or the provisions of
this Plan that apply to such  termination,  the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which  the  dispute  is  finally  resolved,  either  by  mutual  written
agreement of the parties to such dispute or by a final judgment, order or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
which  the  time  for  appeal  therefrom  has  expired  and no  appeal  has been
perfected); provided, however, that the Date of Termination shall be extended by
a notice of  dispute  only if such  notice is given in good faith and the person
giving such notice  pursues  the  resolution  of such  dispute  with  reasonable
diligence.

         4.4   COMPENSATION  DURING  DISPUTE.  If a purported termination  of an
Executive's employment occurs following a Change in Control and such termination
or the  provisions of this Plan that apply upon such  termination is disputed in
accordance  with Section 4.3 hereof  (including a dispute as to the existence of
good faith and/or reasonable diligence  thereunder),  the Company shall continue
to pay the  Executive  the full  compensation  (including,  but not  limited to,
salary)  at his  Annual  Base  Salary  and  continue  his  participation  in all
compensation  plans required to be maintained  hereunder and continue to provide
to him the Welfare  Benefits  provided for in Subsection  3.2.2 hereof until the
dispute is finally resolved in accordance with Section 4.3 hereof.  Amounts paid
under this Section 4.4 are in addition to all other  amounts due under this Plan
(other  than those due under  Subsection  3.1.1  hereof) and shall not be offset
against or reduce any other amounts due under this Plan.

         6.1   CLAIMS PROCEDURE. Claims for benefits under the Plan shall be
filed with the Plan Administrator.  If any Executive or other payee claims to be
entitled to a benefit under the Plan and the Plan Administrator  determines that
such claim  shall be denied in whole or in part,  the Plan  Administrator  shall
notify such person of its decision in writing. Such notification will be written
in a manner  calculated  to be  understood  by such person and will  contain (a)
specific  reasons for the denial,  (b)  specific  reference  to  pertinent  Plan
provisions,  (c)  a  description  of  any  additional  material  or  information
necessary for such person to perfect such claim and an  explanation  of why such

with the Plan  Administrator  for a review of his denied  claim and of pertinent
documents and (b) submit written issues and comments to the Plan  Administrator.
The Plan Administrator will notify such person of its decision in writing.  Such

                        PLAN MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION

         The Plan may be amended or terminated by resolution of the Board at any
time; provided,  however, that: (a) Schedule I hereto may be amended at any time
and in any manner by resolution of the Compensation  Committee of the Board upon
recommendation  of the Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer;  and (b) Schedule I
hereto may be amended at any time by the Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer to
delete any one or more persons therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the
Plan may not be  terminated  or amended in a manner  adverse to the interests of
any Executive, without his consent (including the amendment of Schedule I hereto
to delete him therefrom) (i) after a Potential  Change in Control occurs and for
one (1) year following the cessation of a Potential  Change in Control,  or (ii)
for the two-year period following  consummation of the transaction(s)  resulting
from or in the  Change  in  Control;  and  (b) no  termination  of this  Plan or
amendment hereof in a manner adverse to the interests of any Executive,  without
his  consent  (including  the  amendment  of  Schedule  I hereto to  delete  him
therefrom),  shall be effective if such  termination or amendment  occurs (i) at
the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect
a Change in Control or (ii) in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control or Potential  Change in Control.  For this  purpose,  the cessation of a
Potential  Change in  Control  occurs if a Change in  Control  has not  occurred
within one year following the Potential Change in Control. In the event that the
termination  of this  Plan by the  Company  or an  amendment  hereof in a manner
adverse to the  interests of any Executive  (without his consent)  occurs within
six (6) months  prior to a  Potential  Change in Control or a Change in Control,
there shall be a presumption  that the  conditions of subclauses (i) and (ii) of
clause  (b) of the  next  preceding  sentence  shall  have  been  met.  Upon the
expiration  of the  Coverage  Period,  the Plan may not be amended in any manner
which would adversely  affect the rights which any Executive has at that time to
receive any and all  payments  or  benefits  pursuant to Articles 2, 3, and 4 by
reason of a Change in Control which has  theretofore  occurred or by reason of a
termination  of his  employment  during the Coverage  Period,  and the Company's
obligations  to make such payments and provide such  benefits  shall survive any
termination of the Plan.

         8.1   TERMINATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF CHANGE IN CONTROL. An Executive's
employment  shall be deemed to have been terminated by the Company without Cause
during the  Coverage  Period if his  employment  is  terminated  by the  Company
without  Cause prior to a Change in Control or  Potential  Change in Control and
such  termination  of employment (a) was at the request of a third party who had
indicated  an  intention  to take or had taken steps  reasonably  calculated  to
effect a Change in Control,  or (b)  otherwise  arose in  connection  with or in
anticipation  of a Change in Control and (c) in either case, a Change in Control
does occur which

                                      25
<PAGE>


may  involve  such third  party (or a party  competing  with such third party to
effectuate a Change in Control). An Executive shall be deemed to have terminated
his employment  for Good Reason during the Coverage  Period if he terminates his
employment with Good Reason prior to a Change in Control or Potential  Change in
Control if the circumstance or event which  constitutes Good Reason (a) occurred
at the request of a third party who had  indicated  an  intention to take or had
taken  steps  reasonably  calculated  to  effect a  Change  in  Control,  or (b)
otherwise  arose in connection  with or in  anticipation of a Change in Control,
and (c) in either  case,  a Change in Control  does occur which may involve such
third party (or a party  competing  with such third party to effectuate a Change
in  Control).  In the event of a  termination  of  employment  described in this
Section 8.1, the Executive  shall be entitled to all payments and other benefits
to which he would have been entitled had such  termination  occurred  during the
Coverage Period (other than salary  pursuant to Subsection  3.1.1 hereof for any
period  after the actual  date of  termination)  and he shall be  entitled to an
additional payment in an amount which shall compensate him to the extent that he
was deprived by such  termination  of the  opportunity  prior to  termination of
employment  to  exercise  any  stock  options  granted  to him  under  the  KEIP
(including  any such stock options that were not  exercisable at the time of his
termination of  employment) at the highest market price of the Company's  Common
Stock  reached in connection  with the Change in Control or Potential  Change in
Control if a  Potential  Change in Control  shall occur and not be followed by a
Change in Control within twelve (12) months of the Potential  Change in Control.
In the event that the  termination of employment of an Executive as described in
this  Section 8.1 occurs  following a Potential  Change in Control or within six
(6) months  prior to a Change in  Control,  there  shall be a  presumption  that
clauses (a) and (b) of the first two  sentences  of this  Section 8.1 shall have
been met.

         8.2   BURDEN.  In  any  proceeding  (regardless of who  initiates  such
proceeding) in which the payment of Severance  Benefits or other compensation or
benefits  under  this Plan is at issue,  (i) the  burden of proof as to  whether
Cause exists for purposes of this Plan shall be upon the Company and (ii) in the
event that the last sentence of Section 8.1 applies,  the Company shall have the
burden to  prove,  by clear  and  convincing  evidence,  that a  termination  of
employment  has  not  been  made in  anticipation  of a  Change  in  Control  as
contemplated by Section 8.1.

         8.3   NO RIGHT TO  CONTINUED  EMPLOYMENT.  Nothing in the Plan shall be
deemed to give any  Executive  the  right to be  retained  in the  employ of the
Company,  or to interfere  with the right of the Company to discharge him at any
time and for any lawful reason, with or without notice,  subject in all cases to
the terms of this Plan.

         8.4   NO ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS. Except as otherwise provided herein or
by law, no right or interest of any Executive under the Plan shall be assignable
or transferable,  in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or
otherwise,   including  without  limitation  by  execution,  levy,  garnishment,
attachment, pledge or in any manner; no attempted assignment or transfer thereof
shall be  effective;  and no right or interest of any  Executive  under the Plan
shall be liable  for,  or  subject  to,  any  obligation  or  liability  of such
Executive.

         8.5 DEATH.  This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable
by an Executive's personal or legal representatives,  executors, administrators,
successors,  heirs,  distributees,

                                      26
<PAGE>


devisees and legatees. If an Executive shall die while any amount would still be
payable to him hereunder  (other than amounts which,  by their terms,  terminate
upon his death) if he had continued to live, all such amounts,  unless otherwise
provided herein,  shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to the
executors, personal representatives or administrators of his estate.

         8.6   INCOMPETENCY.  Any  benefit  payable to or for the  benefit of an
Executive,  if legally  incompetent  or incapable of giving a receipt  therefor,
shall be deemed  paid when paid to his  guardian  or to the party  providing  or
reasonably  appearing  to provide  for his care,  and such  payment  shall fully
discharge the Company, the Plan Administrator and all other parties with respect
thereto.

         8.7   REDUCTION OF BENEFITS BY LEGALLY REQUIRED BENEFITS.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Company
is obligated by law or by contract (other than under this Plan) to pay severance
pay, a termination indemnity, notice pay, or the like, to an Executive or if the
Company  is  obligated  by law or by  contract  to  provide  advance  notice  of
separation  ("Notice  Period")  to an  Executive,  then any  Severance  Benefits
payable to him  hereunder  shall be reduced by the amount of any such  severance
pay, termination  indemnity,  notice pay or the like, as applicable,  and by the
amount of any pay received during any Notice Period;  provided however, that the
period  following  a Notice of Intent to  Terminate  shall not be  considered  a
Notice Period.

         8.8   ENFORCEABILITY.  If any provision of the Plan shall be held
invalid or unenforceable,  such invalidity or unenforceability  shall not affect
any other provisions  hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if
such provisions had not been included.

         8.9   EFFECTIVE  DATE.  The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective
Date and shall  remain in effect  unless  and  until  terminated  by the  Board,
subject to the requirements of Article 7 hereof.

         8.10  NO  MITIGATION.  The  Company  agrees  that,  if  an  Executive's
employment  by the  Company  is  terminated  during  the  Coverage  Period,  the
Executive is not required to seek other  employment  or to attempt in any way to
reduce any amounts payable to him by the Company pursuant to this Plan. Further,
the amount of any payment or benefit provided for under this Plan (other than to
the extent provided in Subsections  3.2.2 and 3.2.5) shall not be reduced by any
compensation  earned by him as a result of  employment by another  employer,  by
retirement  benefits,  by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by him to
the Company, or otherwise.

         8.11  SUCCESSORS. In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon
any  successor  to the  Company,  the Company  shall be obligated to require any
successor  (whether  direct or  indirect,  by purchase,  merger,  consolidation,
operation  of law, or  otherwise)  to all or  substantially  all of the business
and/or  assets of the  Company to  expressly  assume  and agree to  perform  the
Company's  obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company  would be required to perform  them if no such  succession  had
taken  place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such  assumption  and  agreement
prior to the  effectiveness  of any such

                                      27
<PAGE>


succession  shall entitle each Executive to  compensation  and benefits from the
Company  in the same  amount and on the same  terms as he would be  entitled  to
hereunder  if he were to terminate  his  employment  for Good Reason  during the
Coverage Period.

         8.12  CONSENT TO CANCELLATION  OF AWARDS AND REDUCTION OF SERP BENEFIT.
The Company may  condition  the payment to an  Executive  of his Vested  Current
Bonus Amount,  Vested  Current PSU Amount,  Vested  Deferred Bonus Amount and/or
Vested  Deferred  PSU  Amount  upon  his  providing  a  written  consent  to the
cancellation of the applicable  contingent target AIP and PSU grants and AIP and
PSU Awards for which payment has been deferred on which his Vested Current Bonus
Amount,  Vested Current PSU Amount,  Vested  Deferred Bonus Amount and/or Vested
Deferred  PSU Amount is based and in lieu of which such  amounts  are paid.  The
Company may condition the payment to an Executive of his Vested  Pension  Amount
or the providing of any benefit or payment under Section 2.5 or Subsection 3.4.4
hereof upon his providing a written consent to, as applicable, (i) the reduction
of the  benefit  to be paid  under  the SERP  (whether  in the form of a monthly
payment to him and his surviving  spouse or as a lump sum) such  reduction to be
in the  amount  of the SERP  Benefit  which was used in the  calculation  of his
Vested Pension Benefit or the amount of any payments or benefits  provided under
Subsection  3.4.4,  or (ii) the reduction of his Excess  Account under the CLRP,
such  reduction  to be in the amount of the CLRP  Benefit  which was used in the
calculation of his Vested Pension Benefit.

         8.13  EMPLOYMENT BY SUBSIDIARY. For purposes of this Plan, an Executive
who is employed by a  Subsidiary  shall be treated as if employed by the Company
and his  entitlement  to benefits  hereunder  shall be  determined as if he were
employed by the Company. For such purpose, the Subsidiary shall be treated as if
it were an unincorporated division of the Company.

         8.14  WAIVER. No waiver by an Executive at any time of any breach of
the terms of this Plan, or compliance  with,  any condition or provision of this
Plan to be  performed  by the  Company  shall be deemed a waiver of  similar  or
dissimilar  provisions  or  conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent
time.

         8.15  WITHHOLDING  TAXES.  Any  payments  to an  Executive  provided
for hereunder  shall be paid net of any  applicable  withholding  required under
federal,  state  or local  law and any  additional  withholding  to which he has
agreed.

         8.16  CONSTRUCTION.  The headings and captions  herein are provided for
reference and  convenience  only,  shall not be considered part of the Plan, and
shall not be employed in the  construction  of the Plan.  Neither the gender nor
the  number  (singular  or plural)  of any word  shall be  construed  to exclude
another gender or number when a different gender or number would be appropriate.

         8.17  NOTICES.  Any notice or other communication required or permitted
pursuant  to the terms  hereof  shall be deemed  to have  been duly  given  when
delivered  or  mailed by United  States  Mail,  first  class,  postage  prepaid,
addressed to the intended recipient at his last known address (which in the case
of an  Executive  shall be the address  specified  by him in any written  notice
provided to the Company in accordance with this Section 8.17).

                                      28

         8.18  STATUTORY  CHANGES.  All  references to sections of the Exchange
Act or the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to
such sections.

         8.19  GOVERNING  LAW.  This Plan shall be  construed  and  enforced
according  to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not  preempted  by
Federal law, which shall otherwise control.


                                    ARTICLE 9
                            TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE
                       UNRELATED TO A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN
                          CONTROL OR CHANGE IN CONTROL

         9.1  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  noted  below,  in the event
Executive's  employment  with the  Company  is, or is  deemed to be,  terminated
without cause (as defined  below),  regardless of whether a Potential  Change in
Control or Change in  Control  has  occurred  or is  pending  (such  termination
hereinafter is referred to as "Change in Status Event"); provided,  however, any
termination of an Executive's  employment  which results in such Executive being
entitled to Severance  Benefits  pursuant to Section 3.2 shall not  constitute a
Change in Status Event and no Executive  entitled to Severance Benefits pursuant
to Section 3.2 shall in addition be  entitled to the  benefits  provided  for in
this Section 9.1:

              From and  after the date of the  Change in Status  Event for a
period of two years thereafter, the Company will continue Executive as an active
employee on a paid leave of absence with benefit coverage,  excluding disability
coverage.  Executive's base  compensation  during the paid leave of absence will
equal his or her Annual  Base  Salary as defined  in Section  1.2  (substituting
"Change in Status  Event" for "Change in Control") of Article 1 of this Group 3A
Plan. Executive shall also remain a participant in the AIP during the paid leave
of absence period and  Executive's  target  percentage for AIP payment  purposes
will be that in effect just prior to the Change in Status  Event,  and Executive
will  be  scored  on  the  basis  of the  actual  achievement  of the  Company's
performance  targets  for  AIP,  but up to a  maximum  of 100%.  Executive  will
additionally  be entitled to payments for AIP and PSU grants for any  previously
deferred awards or any awards  covering  periods ending prior to the date of the
Change in Status  Event that have been earned but not yet paid prior to the date
of the Change in Status Event.

              9.1.1  During the above leave of absence: (a) Executive's stock
options  granted  prior to the Change in Status  Event will  continue to vest in
accordance  with the  vesting  schedule(s)  applicable  under  the  terms of the
grant(s),  but (b) Executive  will not be eligible to  participate in or receive
new grants or benefits under the LTIP and will not be eligible for participation
in or the payment of  benefits  under the  Executive  Benefits  Protection  Plan
(except for under this Article 9), the Employee Benefits Protection Plan, or the
Severance  Benefits Plan. If Executive  meets the  eligibility  requirements  of
paragraph 3 of the Corporation's  Supplemental  Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
and elects to retire from employment  with the  Corporation  during the leave of
absence,  Executive's paid leave of absence will cease and the Executive will be

                                      29
<PAGE>


treated for all purposes as a retiree in  accordance  with the terms of the SERP
and the Corporation's other benefit plans.

         9.2   Executive's  voluntary  resignation from the  Company  shall  not
constitute a Change in Status Event, and therefore will not entitle Executive to
the benefits  provided for in Section 9.1 above. In such event,  Executive would
be entitled to the benefits  provided  under the benefit plans of the Company to
which Executive is entitled in accordance with the terms of those plans.

         9.3   Termination of Executive's  employment "without cause" for
purposes of this Article 9 shall mean  termination  of employment by the Company
not based on "cause" as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the SERP.

         9.4   The  severance  arrangements  of  this  Article  9 shall  not  be
considered to constitute an employment contract. The terms and conditions of the
Long-Term  Incentive  Program  Participation  Agreement and Mutual  Agreement to
Arbitrate Claims by and between  Executive and the Company  ("Participation  and
Arbitration  Agreement"),  are incorporated  herein by reference and made a part
hereof as if fully set  forth  herein.  Notwithstanding  any  provisions  to the
contrary  in  the  Participation  and  Arbitration  Agreement,   the  terms  and
conditions  thereof  shall  remain in effect for three years  after  Executive's
Change in Status  Event  regardless  of whether  Executive is eligible or not to
receive benefits under the SERP.



         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Company has caused the Plan to be amended and
restated as of the 19th day of August, 2002.
