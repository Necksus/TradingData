        recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
        been included. Operating results for the three months and year-to-date

        In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due
        2007 (6.95% Notes) under the November 1993 Form S-3 Registration
        Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion
        of the commercial paper borrowings associated with the acquisition of
        the Leaf North America confectionery operations (Leaf) in December 1996.

        In August 1997, the Corporation filed another Form S-3 Registration
        Statement under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis,
        up to $500 million of additional debt securities. Also in August 1997,
        the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2012 (Notes) and
        $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 (Debentures) under the November
        1993 and August 1997 Registration Statements. Proceeds from the debt
        issuance were used to repay short-term borrowings associated with the
        purchase of Common Stock from the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for
        the benefit of Milton Hershey School (Milton Hershey School Trust). As
        of July 5, 1998, $250 million of debt securities remained available for
        issuance under the August 1997 Registration Statement. As of July 5,
        1998 and December 31, 1997, $150.0 million of commercial paper
        borrowings were reclassified as long-term debt in accordance with the
        Corporation's intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a
        long-term basis.

7.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
        equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt,
        including $150.0 million of commercial paper borrowings reclassified as
        long-term debt, approximated fair value as of July 5, 1998 and December
        31, 1997, because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments.
        The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was
        $879.2 million as of July 5, 1998, compared to a fair value of $958.8
        million, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt
        issues.

        As of July 5, 1998, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
        contracts maturing in 1998 and 1999 to purchase $18.3 million in foreign
        currency, primarily British sterling and Swiss francs, and to sell $11.6
        million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen and Canadian
        dollars, at contracted forward rates.

        To hedge foreign currency exposure related to anticipated transactions
        associated with the purchase of certain raw materials and finished
        goods, generally covering 3 to 24 months, the Corporation, from time to
        time, also purchases foreign exchange options which permit, but do not
        require, the Corporation to exchange foreign currencies at a future date
        with another party at a contracted exchange rate. As of July 5, 1998,
        the Corporation had purchased foreign exchange options of $4.1 million
        and written foreign exchange options of $3.9 million, related to German
        marks. No options were outstanding as of June 29, 1997.

        The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
        obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
        necessary for maturity differences. The fair value of foreign exchange
<PAGE>
       
        options is estimated using active market quotations. As of July 5, 1998,
        the fair value of foreign exchange forward and options contracts
        approximated the contract value. The Corporation does not hold or issue
        financial instruments for trading purposes.

        In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
        exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
        swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate
        debt to fixed rate debt. As of July 5, 1998, the Corporation had
        agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $150.0
        million, with maturities through 1999. As of July 5, 1998, interest
        rates payable were at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.3%, and the
        interest rate receivable was floating based on the 30-day commercial
        paper composite rate which was 5.5% as of July 5, 1998. Any interest
        rate differential on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment
        to interest expense over the term of each agreement. The Corporation's
        risk related to swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such
        agreements at prevailing market rates.

8.      DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

        In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
        INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (FAS No. 133). FAS No. 133
        establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
        derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an
        asset or liability measured at its fair value. FAS No. 133 requires that
        changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in
        earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
        accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses
        to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement,
        and requires that a company must formally document, designate, and
        assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

        FAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999,
        but may be implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after
        issuance. Retroactive application is not permitted. FAS No. 133 must be
        applied to (a) derivative instruments and (b) certain derivative
        instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued, acquired, or
        substantively modified after December 31, 1997. Changes in accounting
        methods will be required for derivative instruments utilized by the
        Corporation to hedge commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and
        interest rate risks. Such derivatives include, but are not limited to,
        commodity futures and options contracts, foreign exchange forward and
        options contracts and interest rate swaps.

        The  Corporation  has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting FAS No.
        133 on its financial  statements and has not determined the timing of
        or method of adoption.  However, the implementation of FAS No. 133 could
        increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SECOND QUARTER 1998 VS. SECOND QUARTER 1997
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the second quarter fell from $905.7 million in 1997
to $880.4 million in 1998, a decrease of 3% from the prior year. The lower sales
primarily reflected lower sales related to the promotional tie-in with the movie
GODZILLA as compared to last year's highly successful LOST WORLD promotion,
continued softness in the Corporation's Asian and Russian markets and a higher
level of unsalables. These decreases were offset somewhat by incremental sales
from the introduction of new confectionery products.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.4% in 1997 to 40.6% in 1998. The
decrease reflected the cost of realigning our Russian business, lower
profitability resulting from the mix of non-chocolate and chocolate
confectionery items sold in the second quarter of 1998 compared to sales in the
second quarter of 1997, and increased production and distribution costs for
certain products sold under special promotions and for seasonal items. These
higher costs were partially offset by lower costs for raw materials and
packaging and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, marketing and
administrative expenses decreased by 6%, primarily reflecting lower marketing
expenses for existing products, offset somewhat by increased spending associated
with the introduction of new products.

Net interest expense in the second quarter of 1998 was $4.9 million above the
comparable period of 1997 primarily as a result of increased borrowings
associated with the purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School
Trust.

The  second  quarter effective income tax  rate  decreased  from  39.3%  in 1997
to  39.0%  in 1998  primarily  due to  changes  in the mix of the
Corporation's income among various tax jurisdictions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST SIX MONTHS 1998 VS. FIRST SIX MONTHS 1997
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the first six months of 1998 increased by $70.3
million or 4% primarily as a result of incremental sales from the introduction
of new confectionery products, increased sales of core confectionery items and
higher sales of grocery and pasta products. These increases were offset somewhat
by a decline in sales in the Corporation's Asian and Russian markets and a
higher level of unsalables.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.3% in 1997 to 40.6% in 1998. The
decrease was primarily due to lower profitability resulting from the mix of
non-chocolate and chocolate confectionery items sold in 1998 compared to sales
in 1997, the cost of realigning our Russian business, and higher costs for
certain major raw materials, primarily milk and cocoa, labor and overhead. These
cost increases were partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies
associated primarily with production of the acquired Leaf brands. Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses were slightly less than 1997, as higher
marketing expenses associated with the introduction of new products were offset
by lower spending for existing brands.
<PAGE>

Net interest expense was $11.9 million above prior year, primarily as a result
of increased borrowings associated with the purchase of Common Stock from the
Milton Hershey School Trust.

The effective income tax rate decreased from 39.3% in 1997 to 39.0% in 1998
primarily due to changes in the mix of the Corporation's income among various
tax jurisdictions.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper. During the first six months of 1998, the Corporation's cash and cash
equivalents decreased by $20.6 million. Cash and cash equivalents on hand at the
beginning of the period, cash provided from operations and short-term borrowings
were sufficient to finance capital and capitalized software additions of $98.0
million, pay cash dividends of $61.7 million and to repay $25.1 million of
long-term debt.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.4:1 as of July 5, 1998,
and 1.3:1 as of December 31, 1997. The Corporation's capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders' equity, short-term
and long-term debt) was 59% as of July 5, 1998, and 60% as of December 31, 1997.

As of July 5, 1998, the Corporation maintained committed credit facility
agreements with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $600 million which could
be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper. The
Corporation has options to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with the
concurrence of the banks. As of July 5, 1998, and June 29, 1997, the Corporation
also had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks in the
amount of approximately $20 million.

In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes under a
November 1993 Registration Statement. In August 1997, the Corporation issued
$150 million of Notes and $250 million of Debentures under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration Statements. As of July 5, 1998, $250 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration
Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250 million of debt securities
available under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate
requirements, which include reducing existing commercial paper borrowings,
financing capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.

As of July 5, 1998, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization. The Corporation anticipates
that capital expenditures will be in the range of $175 million to $200 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of continued modernization
of existing facilities and capacity expansion to support new products and line
extensions.

In late 1996, the Corporation approved a project to implement an enterprise-wide
integrated information system to replace most of the transaction systems and
applications currently supporting operations of the Corporation. Total
<PAGE>

commitments for this system are expected to be in the range of $75 million to
$85 million. The system is Year 2000 compliant.

The Corporation is evaluating its manufacturing processes and remaining 
legacy information systems to identify and remediate any Year 2000 compliance 
issues. In addition, major business partners and suppliers are being contacted
to gain assurances that they will be Year 2000 compliant. Failure, either by the
Corporation, its major business partners or suppliers, to complete remediation 
in a timely manner could result in significant adverse financial consequences to
the Corporation.

At the present time, the total cost to remediate Year 2000 compliance issues is
not expected to be material to the Corporation's business, operations or
financial condition. It is also expected that remediation to both the
Corporation's manufacturing processes and information systems and those of major
business partners or suppliers will be completed in time to prevent any material
adverse consequences to the Corporation's business, operations or financial
condition.

The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and
interest rate swaps resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not material as of July 5, 1998. The market risk
resulting from a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent
associated with the estimated average fair value of net commodity positions
declined from $9.6 million as of December 31, 1997, to $7.5 million as of July
5, 1998. Market risk represents 10% of the estimated average fair value of net
commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period. The decrease
in average market risk was primarily related to changes in the excess of futures
contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts in 1998 compared to
1997.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

The nature of the Corporation's operations and the environment in which it
operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In connection with the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the
Corporation notes the following factors which, among others, could cause future
results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations
and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Forward looking statements
contained in this document include, but are not limited to Year 2000 issues
(particularly with regard to the Corporation's business partners and suppliers),
the impact of the use of derivative instruments, the amount of future capital
expenditures and the possible uses of proceeds from any future borrowings under
the Corporation's currently effective credit facility or August 1997
Registration Statement. Factors which could cause results to differ include, but
are not limited to: changes in the confectionery and pasta business environment,
including actions of competitors and changes in consumer preferences; changes in
governmental laws and regulations, including income taxes; market demand for new
and existing products; and raw material pricing.

                            ARTICLE I - STOCKHOLDERS



        Section 1.  ANNUAL MEETING.  The annual meeting of stockholders shall be
 held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, either within
 or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the 
Board of Directors from time to time.  Any other proper business may be 
transacted at the annual meeting.

        Section 2. SPECIAL MEETINGS. A special meeting of the stockholders may
be called by the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee of the Board of
Directors or by stockholders holding in the aggregate at least twenty-five
percent of the outstanding votes entitled to be cast by holders of the Common
Stock and the Class B Common Stock voting together without regard to class on
the date such meeting is called.

        Section 3. PLACE OF MEETINGS. All meetings of the stockholders shall be
held at such places, within or without the State of Delaware, as may from time
to time be fixed by the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified or fixed in
the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.

        Section 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Notice of each meeting of the
stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than ten nor
more than sixty days before the date on which the meeting is to be held to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote, by delivering a written or printed
notice thereof to him, personally, or by mailing such notice in a postage
prepaid envelope addressed to him at his post office address registered with the
Corporation. No publication of any notice of a meeting of stockholders shall be

<PAGE>


        Section 6. QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE. At any meeting of stockholders at
which any action is to be taken or questions decided (including the election of
directors), the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of
the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting with respect to such action or
question shall constitute a quorum, provided, however, that at such time as
shares of the Class B Common Stock become outstanding, with respect to the
taking of any action or the deciding of any question as to which either the
Common Stock or the Class B Common Stock is entitled to vote separately as a
class pursuant to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by such class voting
separately as a class at such meeting shall constitute a quorum. At every such
meeting at which a quorum is present for the taking of any action or the
deciding of any question, a majority of the votes present or represented shall
be necessary to take such action or decide such question, with the Common Stock
and the Class B Common Stock voting together without regard to class or

Restated Certificate of Incorporation, provided, however, that with respect to
the election of directors pursuant to the provisions of the Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and these By-laws, the persons receiving the greatest number of
votes, in descending order, shall be elected for the positions to be filled. The
absence of a quorum as provided for herein for the taking of any one action or
the deciding of any one question shall not prevent the taking of any other
action or the deciding of any other question for which a quorum is present.

        Section 7. INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. The Corporation shall, in advance of
any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act
at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate
one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails

at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint
one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering
upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully
to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or
designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine
the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv)
determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any
challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their
determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots.
Such certification shall specify such other information as may be required by
law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such
information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for
an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.

Corporation not later than the close of business on the fifteenth (15th) day

meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b)

represented by certificates or shall be uncertificated. Each registered holder
of shares, upon request to the Corporation, shall be provided a certificate of
stock, representing the number of shares owned by such holder. Absent a specific
request for such a certificate by the registered owner or transferee thereof,
all shares shall be uncertificated upon the original issuance thereof by the
Corporation or upon the surrender of the certificate representing such shares to
the Corporation. Certificates for shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
shall be in such form as shall be approved by the Board of Directors. They shall
be signed by or have engraved thereon a facsimile signature of the Chief
Executive Officer and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary, certifying the number and class of the Corporation's
shares held by such stockholder.

        Section 2. TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS. The Board of Directors may,
in its discretion, appoint responsible banks or trust companies or other
appropriately qualified institutions to act as Transfer Agents and Registrars of
the stock of the Corporation; and, upon such appointments being made, no stock
certificate shall be valid until countersigned by one of such Transfer Agents
and registered by one of such Registrars. Where any such certificate is
registered with the manual signature of a Registrar, the countersignature of a
Transfer Agent may be a facsimile or engraved, stamped or printed. The Board of
Directors may also make such additional rules and regulations as it may deem
expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of uncertificated
shares or certificates for shares of the capital stock of the Corporation.

        Section 3. TRANSFER OF STOCK. Shares of stock may be transferred by
delivery of the certificates therefore, accompanied by an assignment in writing
on the back of the certificates or by written power of attorney to sell, assign
and transfer the same, signed by the record holder thereof , upon receipt of
proper transfer instructions from the owner of uncertificated shares, or upon
the escheat of said shares under the laws of any state of the United States. In
no event shall a transfer of shares affect the right of the Corporation to pay
any dividend upon the stock to the holder of record thereof for all purposes,
and no transfer shall be valid, except between the parties thereto, until such
transfer shall have been made upon the books of the Corporation.






        Section 4. LOST CERTIFICATES. In case any certificate of stock shall be
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may
authorize the issue of, or provide for the manner of issuing an uncertificated
share, or if requested by such holder, a substitute share certificate in place
of the certificate so lost, stolen or destroyed; provided, that, in each such
case, the applicant for a substitute certificate shall furnish to the
Corporation and to such of its Transfer Agents and Registrars as may require the
same evidence to their satisfaction, in their discretion, of the loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate and of the ownership thereof, and also such
security or indemnity as may be required by them.

          Section 5. RECORD DATE. The Board of Directors may fix a record date
for the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof; to receive payment of
any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock; or for the
purpose of any other lawful action. The record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and the record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to
the date of such meeting or such action, or, with respect to any such meeting,
less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. Only stockholders of
record on the record date shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such
meeting, or to receive such dividends or rights, or to exercise such rights, as
the case may be. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for
the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.

          Section 6. DIVIDENDS. The Board of Directors may declare and pay such
dividends upon the shares of the Corporation's capital stock out of the surplus
of the net profits of the Corporation as it may deem expedient and as the
condition of the Corporation shall warrant.

                     subsidiaries, or

               (b)   a director, officer or employee of the Corporation and is

                     designation by the Chief Executive Officer as a director,
                     officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another
                     corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust,
                     nonprofit entity or other enterprise, including service
                     with respect to employee benefit plans,



<PAGE>


against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such person or on such person's behalf in connection with
any such Proceeding. However, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a
person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was or is authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

          Section 2. ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. The Corporation shall pay the
reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) as and when incurred by a
director or officer of the Corporation in connection with any Proceeding
described in Section 1 in advance of its final disposition, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such payment shall be made only upon a receipt of an undertaking by the
director or officer to repay all expenses (including attorneys' fees) advanced
if it should be ultimately determined that the director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise. Payment of such
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by employees of the Corporation
may be made by the Board of Directors in its discretion upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as it deems appropriate.

          Section 3. RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise. The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided for by this Article VI shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer or employee described in Section 1 and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person.

          Section 4. CLAIMS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article
VI, if a claim by a director, officer or employee described in Section 1 for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not paid in
full within thirty days after a written claim therefor has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such
claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid in
full all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such
claim. In any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that
the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of
expenses under applicable law and this Article VI.

          Section 5. OTHER INDEMNIFICATION. The Corporation's obligation to
indemnify or advance expenses hereunder to a person who is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation (as provided for in Section 1) as a director,
officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person is entitled to and
actually receives as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise.

          Section 6. AMENDMENT OR REPEAL. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to or at the time of such repeal or modification.

                       ARTICLE VII - EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

          Section 1. BOARD OF DIRECTORS. During any emergency resulting from an
attack on the United States or on a locality in which the Corporation conducts
its business or customarily holds meetings of its Board of Directors or its
stockholders or during a nuclear or atomic disaster or during the existence of
any catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition (any of the foregoing is
hereinafter referred to as an "Emergency Condition"), as a result of which a
quorum of the Board of Directors cannot readily be convened for action
(including by telephone), then in addition to any director or directors who are
able and available, the elected officers of the Corporation, as and in the order
designated in advance by the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and
approved by the Board of Directors, who are able and available shall be deemed
for all purposes to be directors to the extent required to constitute a quorum
for any meeting of the Board of Directors during such Emergency Condition,
notwithstanding any limitations or other provisions contained in the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws or resolutions of the Board of
Directors in effect at the time of the Emergency Condition.

          Section 2. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. If as a result of any Emergency
Condition or due to his incapacitation, the Chief Executive Officer is unable or
unavailable to act, then until the Chief Executive Officer becomes able and
available to act or a new Chief Executive Officer is elected by the Board of
Directors, the officer of the Corporation, as and in the order designated in
advance by the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and approved by the
Board of Directors, who is able and available to act shall act as Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation.

          Section 3. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. During an Emergency Condition or during
anytime in which the Chief Executive Officer becomes unable or unavailable to
act, a meeting of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the
Board or the Chair of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance. If
neither is able and available, then a meeting of the Board of Directors may be
called by any director, and if none are able and available to do so, by any
elected officer of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called by notice of
the time and place given to such of the directors, or officers serving as
directors in accordance with this Article, as it may be feasible to reach at the
time and by such means (including electronic) as may be feasible at the time.

          Section 4. POWERS DURING AN EMERGENCY CONDITION. During an Emergency
Condition, the Board of Directors (including those serving as the Board pursuant
to Section 1 above) may take any acts in good faith deemed necessary and in the
best interests of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, changing the
head office or designating several alternative head offices or regional offices
of the Corporation, or providing for and from time to time modifying lines of
succession in the event that during any such Emergency Condition any or all
officers or agents of the Corporation shall for any reason be rendered incapable
of discharging their duties.

          Section 5.  LIABILITY.  No officer or director shall be liable for any
act taken in accordance with this Article during an Emergency Condition, except
for willful misconduct.


          Section 6. EFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER BY-LAWS. To the extent not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Article, the other By-laws of the
Corporation shall remain in effect during any Emergency Condition and upon its
termination, the provisions of this Article shall cease to be operative.



                            ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENTS

          These By-laws may be amended or repealed, in whole or in part, and new
By-laws may be adopted, either by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Common Stock and the Class B
Common Stock voting together without regard to class, given at any meeting of
stockholders or by a consent, or by the affirmative vote of two-thirds
(calculated to the nearest whole number) of the total number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors, given at any meeting of directors or by a
consent.
