         of intercompany  accounts and transactions.  These statements have been

         include all of the  information  and  footnotes  required by  generally
         accepted accounting  principles for complete financial  statements.  In
         the opinion of management,  all adjustments  (consisting only of normal
         recurring accruals)  considered  necessary for a fair presentation have
         been included. Operating results for the six months ended July 2, 2000,
         are not necessarily  indicative of the results that may be expected for
         the year ending December 31, 2000. For more  information,  refer to the
         consolidated   financial  statements  and  footnotes  included  in  the

6.       LONG-TERM DEBT

         In August 1997, the Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement
         under which it could offer,  on a delayed or  continuous  basis,  up to
         $500 million of additional  debt  securities.  As of July 2, 2000, $250
         million of debt  securities  remained  available for issuance under the
         August 1997 Registration Statement.

7.       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         The carrying amounts of financial  instruments  including cash and cash
         equivalents,  accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
         approximated  fair  value as of July 2,  2000 and  December  31,  1999,
         because of the  relatively  short  maturity of these  instruments.  The
         carrying value of long-term debt,  including the current  portion,  was
         $878.5  million as of July 2, 2000,  compared to a fair value of $859.4
         million,  based on quoted  market  prices for the same or similar  debt
         issues.

                                       8
<PAGE>

         As of July 2,  2000,  the  Corporation  had  foreign  exchange  forward
         contracts  maturing  in 2000  and 2001 to  purchase  $46.6  million  in
         foreign currency, primarily British sterling, and to sell $25.3 million
         in foreign  currency,  primarily  Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at
         contracted forward rates.

         The fair value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts is estimated by
         obtaining  quotes for future  contracts  with similar  terms,  adjusted
         where necessary for maturity differences.  As of July 2, 2000, the fair
         value of foreign exchange forward  contracts  approximated the contract
         value. The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for
         trading purposes.

         In order to minimize its  financing  costs and to manage  interest rate
         exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
         swap  agreements.  In October  1999,  the  Corporation  entered into an
         interest  rate swap  agreement to  effectively  convert $200 million of
         6.7% Notes Due 2005 (Notes) to variable  rate debt.  The interest  rate
         swap agreement is cancelable at the sole discretion of the counterparty
         effective April 2, 2001. At the same time, the Corporation entered into
         forward  interest rate agreements to fix the interest rate on the Notes
         at 5.8%  through  April  2,  2001.  Subsequently,  if the  counterparty
         chooses not to cancel the  agreement,  the  interest  rate on the Notes
         would be  variable  based on the London  Interbank  Offered  Rate until
         expiration on October 1, 2005.

         Any  interest  rate  differential  on  interest  rate swaps and forward
         agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest  expense over the
         term of each agreement.  As of July 2, 2000, the fair value of interest
         rate swaps and forward agreements  approximated the contract value. The
         Corporation's  risk related to swaps and forward  agreements is limited
         to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates.

8.       DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

         In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
         of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative
         Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities  (SFAS  No.  133).  SFAS No.  133
         establishes  accounting  and reporting  standards  requiring that every
         derivative  instrument  be recorded  in the balance  sheet as either an
         asset or  liability  measured at its fair value.  SFAS No. 133 requires
         that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized  currently in
         earnings unless  specific hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Special
         accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses
         to offset related  results on the hedged item in the income  statement,
         and requires  that a company must  formally  document,  designate,  and
         assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

         SFAS No. 133 is  effective  for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15,
         2000,  but may be implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter
         after issuance.  Retroactive application is not permitted. SFAS No. 133
         must  be  applied  to  (a)  derivative   instruments  and  (b)  certain
         derivative  instruments  embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued,
         acquired, or substantively modified after December 31, 1997. Changes in
         accounting methods will be required for derivative instruments utilized
         by the Corporation to hedge commodity price,  foreign currency exchange
         rate and  interest  rate  risks.  Such  derivatives  include  commodity
         futures contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate
         swaps and forward agreements.

         The Corporation  anticipates the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January
         1, 2001.  As of July 2, 2000,  net deferred  losses on  derivatives  of
         approximately  $39.6  million  after tax would have been  reported as a
         component of other  comprehensive  loss and  classified as  accumulated
         other  comprehensive  loss  on the  consolidated  balance  sheets  upon
         adoption of SFAS No. 133. The

         adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not  expected to have a material  impact on
         the Corporation's results of operations.

9.       SHARE REPURCHASES

         In October 1999, the Corporation's  Board of Directors approved a share
         repurchase program  authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of
         the  Corporation's  Common  Stock.  Under  this  program,  a  total  of
         1,100,847  shares of Common  Stock was  purchased  during the first six
         months of 2000.  As of July 2, 2000, a total of  43,145,248  shares was
         held as  Treasury  Stock and  $151.3  million  remained  available  for
         repurchases  of Common Stock under the repurchase  program  approved in
         October.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations - Second Quarter 2000 vs. Second Quarter 1999
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated  net sales for the second quarter  decreased from $853.2 million in
1999 to $836.2  million in 2000, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. The lower
sales primarily  reflected a decline in sales of core  confectionery and grocery
products,  offset  partially by incremental  sales from the  introduction of new
confectionery products, and lower returns,  discounts, and allowances.  In 2000,
certain international  distributor  allowances were netted against sales instead
of being reported in selling,  marketing and administrative expenses as in 1999.
The second  quarter of 1999  included  approximately  $25  million in net sales,
shifted from the third quarter, as part of a controlled advance purchase program
intended to reduce  disruptions  during the final phase of the implementation of
an enterprise-wide information system last year.

The  consolidated  gross margin  increased  from 39.9% in 1999 to 40.0% in 2000.
Gross  margin in 1999  would  have been .3  percentage  point  lower if  certain
international distributor allowances were reclassified and reported as discussed
above for 2000.  The  increase in gross  margin  reflected  decreased  costs for
certain  major  raw  materials,  primarily  cocoa,  as  well as  lower  returns,
discounts,  and allowances.  The impact of these items was partially  offset by:
higher  transportation  costs;  higher  warehousing  costs related to increasing
storage and  shipping  capacity  for the peak  shipping  season,  including  the
start-up of the new Eastern and Southeastern Distribution Centers; and increased
costs for the disposal of obsolete  packaging and aged  inventory.  In addition,
manufacturing costs and depreciation expense were higher as a percentage of
sales compared to the prior year, also reducing gross margin.

Selling,  marketing  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by 4% in  2000,
primarily  reflecting  increased marketing  expenditures for the introduction of
new products and international exports, and higher software amortization costs.

Net  interest  expense in the second  quarter of 2000 was $.8 million  above the
comparable period of 1999,  primarily  reflecting lower capitalized  interest as
fewer construction projects qualified for interest capitalization in 2000.

The second quarter effective income tax rate was 39.0% in 2000 and 1999.

Results of Operations - First Six Months 2000 vs. First Six Months 1999
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated  net  sales for the first  six  months of 2000  increased  by $30.9
million or 2%. The higher sales primarily reflected an increase in sales of core
confectionery and grocery products in North America,  incremental sales from the
introduction of new confectionery  products, and lower returns,  discounts,  and
allowances.  In 2000, certain international  distributor  allowances were netted
against sales instead of being reported in selling, marketing and administrative
expenses as in 1999.  The first six months of 1999 included $29.3 million in net
sales related to the Corporation's pasta business, which was divested in January
1999.

The  consolidated  gross margin  decreased  from 40.2% in 1999 to 39.5% in 2000.
Gross margin in 1999 benefited .8 percentage point from the inclusion in cost of
sales of a one-time  $12.5  million  gain from  revisions  to the  Corporation's
retiree  medical plan,  and results of the pasta  business.  The gain was net of
additional costs for  supplemental  retirement  contributions  into the Employee
Savings Stock  Investment  and Ownership  Plan.  Excluding  results of the pasta
business and the one-time gain in 1999,  the increase in gross margin  reflected
decreased  costs for certain major raw materials,  primarily  cocoa,  as well as
lower  returns,  discounts,  and  allowances.  The  impact  of these  items  was
substantially offset by: higher  transportation  costs; higher warehousing costs

                                       11
<PAGE>


related to increasing  storage and shipping  capacity and increased  storage and
handling rates;  and increased costs for the disposal of obsolete  packaging and
aged inventory.

Selling,  marketing  and  administrative  expenses  decreased  by  1%  in  2000,
primarily  reflecting the divestiture of the pasta business and the inclusion in
2000 of a one-time  gain of $7.3  million  arising  from the exchange of certain
corporate aircraft. Increased marketing expenditures for the introduction of new
products and international exports as well as higher software amortization costs
substantially offset these items.

Net  interest  expense  was $.1  million  below the  comparable  period of 1999,
primarily as a result of the interest rate swap and forward  agreements  entered
into in October  1999 and higher  interest  income.  An increase  in  short-term
interest  expense,  related to higher  borrowing rates and increased  short-term
borrowings, and lower capitalized interest substantially offset these items.

Excluding the provision for income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of
the  Corporation's  pasta business,  the effective  income tax rate was 39.0% in
2000 and 1999.

Net income for the first six months of 2000 of $111.2  million  was 60%  below
the prior  year and net  income  per share - diluted of $.80 per share was $1.13
below the prior year. Prior year net income included an after tax gain of $165.0
million,  or $1.16 per share - diluted,  on the sale of the Corporation's  pasta
business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

Historically,  the  Corporation's  major  source  of  financing  has  been  cash
generated from  operations.  Domestic  seasonal  working  capital  needs,  which
typically  peak  during the summer  months,  generally  have been met by issuing
commercial paper.  During the first six months of 2000, the  Corporation's  cash
and cash  equivalents  decreased by $82.9 million.  Cash and cash equivalents on
hand  at  the  beginning  of the  period,  cash  provided  from  operations  and
short-term  borrowings  were  sufficient  to  repurchase  $73.1  million  of the
Corporation's  Common Stock,  pay cash dividends of $70.1  million,  and finance
capital expenditures and capitalized software additions of $65.0 million.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.7:1 as of July 2, 2000,
and 1.8:1 as of December 31, 1999. The Corporation's capitalization ratio (total
short-term  and  long-term  debt  as  a  percentage  of  stockholders'   equity,
short-term  and  long-term  debt)  was  52% as of July  2,  2000,  and 50% as of
December 31, 1999.

As of July 2, 2000,  the  Corporation  maintained  a committed  credit  facility
agreement  with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $500.0 million which could
be borrowed  directly or used to support the issuance of commercial  paper.  The
Corporation  has the option to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with
the  concurrence  of the banks.  The  Corporation  also had lines of credit with
domestic and  international  commercial banks in the amount of $24.4 million and
$25.0 million, respectively, as of July 2, 2000 and December 31, 1999.

In March  1997,  the  Corporation  issued  $150  million of 6.95%  Notes under a
November 1993  Registration  Statement.  In August 1997, the Corporation  issued
$150 million of Notes and $250 million of Debentures under the November 1993 and
August 1997  Registration  Statements.  As of July 2, 2000, $250 million of debt
securities  remained  available for issuance under the August 1997  Registration
Statement.  Proceeds  from any offering of the $250  million of debt  securities
available  under  the  shelf  registration  may be used

                                       12
<PAGE>

for general corporate  requirements,  which include reducing existing commercial
paper  borrowings,  financing  capital  additions,  and funding future  business
acquisitions and working capital requirements.

As of July 2, 2000, the  Corporation's  principal capital  commitments  included
manufacturing capacity expansion, modernization and efficiency improvements. The
Corporation  anticipates that capital  expenditures will be in the range of $150
million to $170 million per annum  during the next several  years as a result of
continued modernization of existing facilities and capacity expansion to support
new products and line extensions.  Such  expenditures will be financed with cash
provided from operations and short-term borrowings.

In July 1999, the  Corporation  entered into an operating lease agreement for an
amount not to exceed $65 million for the purpose of financing construction costs
of  a  warehouse  and  distribution  facility  located  on  land  owned  by  the
Corporation near Hershey, Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor pays for
the  construction  costs and thereafter  leases the facility to the Corporation.
The lease term is six years, including the construction period. The lease may be
extended  at the  Corporation's  option for up to four  renewal  periods of five
years each. The lease provides for a substantial residual guarantee and includes
an option to purchase the facility at original cost.

The  potential  loss in fair value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  and
interest rate swaps  resulting from a hypothetical  near-term  adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not material as of July 2, 2000. The market risk
resulting  from a  hypothetical  adverse  market  price  movement of ten percent
associated  with the  estimated  average fair value of net  commodity  positions
decreased from $11.1 million as of December 31, 1999, to $8.0 million as of July
2, 2000.  Market risk represents 10% of the estimated  average fair value of net
commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period.

Safe Harbor Statement
- ---------------------

The  nature of the  Corporation's  operations  and the  environment  in which it
operates  subject  it  to  changing   economic,   competitive,   regulatory  and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties.  In connection with the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the
Corporation notes the following factors which, among others,  could cause future
results to differ materially from the forward-looking  statements,  expectations
and  assumptions  expressed  or  implied  herein.  Many  of the  forward-looking
statements  contained  in  this  document  may  be  identified  by  the  use  of
forward-looking  words  such as  "believe,"  "expect,"  "anticipate,"  "should,"
"planned,"  "estimated," and "potential" among others. Factors which could cause
results to differ include,  but are not limited to: changes in the confectionery
and grocery business  environment,  including actions of competitors and changes
in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws and regulations, including
income  and sales  taxes;  market  demand  for new and  existing  products;  raw
material costs; and the  Corporation's  ability to fully remedy the problems and
avoid the increased costs encountered since implementing changes to the customer
service,  warehousing,  and order fulfillment processes and systems in the third
quarter of 1999; the ability to restore customer service to historical levels;
the effects service levels and other factors have on future customer demand; and
the ability to complete construction and commence operations of new warehousing
facilities on schedule.

                           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Items 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been omitted as not applicable.

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

In  January  1999,  the  Corporation  received a Notice of  Proposed  Deficiency
(Notice)  from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  related to the years 1989
through 1996. The Notice pertains to the Corporate  Owned Life Insurance  (COLI)
program which was  implemented  by the  Corporation in 1989. The IRS proposed an
assessment for the disallowance of interest expense  deductions  associated with
the underlying life insurance policies. The total impact of the disallowance was
approximately  $62.5  million,  including  interest  as of  July  2,  2000.  The
Corporation  may be subject to additional  assessments for federal and state tax
and interest payments for years 1997 and 1998. The Corporation  believes that it
has fully  complied  with the tax law as it  relates  to its COLI  program.  The
Corporation filed a protest of the proposed  deficiency with the Appeals section
of the IRS in April 1999 and continues to vigorously defend its position on this
matter. The Corporation has no other material pending legal  proceedings,  other
than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.
