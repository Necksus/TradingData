3.   Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average
     number of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock

 5.  Restructuring Charge

     In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax
     restructuring charge of $106.1 million following a comprehensive
     review of domestic and international operations designed to enhance
     performance of operating assets by lowering operating and
     administrative costs, eliminating underperforming assets and
     streamlining the overall decision-making process.  The charge of
     $106.1 million resulted in an after-tax charge of $80.2 million or
     $.92 per share in 1994.

     The restructuring charge and its subsequent utilization is summarized 
     below (in thousands of dollars):

                                                          Utilized
                                 Total   Utilized as of  in Current  Remaining
                                Charge   Year-End 1994    Period      Reserve
     Employee severance 
      benefits                 $ 34,269   $ (4,239)      $(4,754)    $25,276 
     Loss on disposal of
      businesses                 39,100       (653)           58      38,505 
     Product line

     Consolidation of operations
      and disposal of machinery                                                 
      and equipment              15,203     (3,992)       (2,463)      8,748 

      Total                    $106,105   $(24,050)      $(9,958)    $72,097 

     The charge for employee severance benefits was associated with the
     elimination of approximately 500 positions in the manufacturing,
     technical and administrative areas at both domestic and international
     operations.  Approximately 60% of the charge was non-cash.  During
     the first quarter of 1995, non-cash charges to accrued restructuring
     reserves were $2.3 million.  Operating cash flows will be used to
     fund any severance or other cash items.

 6.  Financial Instruments

     The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
     equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term
     debt approximated fair value as of April 2, 1995 because of the
     relatively short maturity of these instruments.  The carrying value
     of long-term debt, including the current portion, approximated fair
     value as of April 2, 1995, based upon quoted market prices for the
     same or similar debt issues.

     As of April 2, 1995, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
     contracts maturing in 1995 and 1996 to purchase $25.3 million in
     foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars, and to sell $7.2
     million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen, at contracted
     forward rates.  Additionally, the Corporation had purchased foreign
     exchange options of $11.6 million and written foreign exchange
     options of $10.9 million, principally related to British sterling. 
     As of April 2, 1995, the fair value of foreign exchange forward and
     options contracts approximated carrying value.  The Corporation does
     not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

               Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - First Quarter 1995 vs. First Quarter 1994

Consolidated net sales for the first quarter fell from $883.9
million in 1994 to $867.4 million in 1995, a decrease of 2% from
the prior year.  The lower sales primarily reflected soft sales of
existing domestic confectionery brands and the discontinuance of
the Corporation's refrigerated pudding line in late 1994.  These
decreases were partially offset by incremental sales from new
confectionery products, the introduction of confectionery brands in
new international markets and modest pasta selling price increases.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 40.4% in 1994 to 42.0%
in 1995.  The increase was primarily the result of manufacturing
efficiency improvements and selling price increases, partially
offset by higher costs for certain major raw materials and
increased depreciation expense.  Selling, marketing and
administrative expenses decreased by 3%, due to lower levels of
promotion expenses primarily related to the sales volume decline,
and lower administrative expenses.  These decreases were partially
offset by increased advertising expense for existing confectionery
brands.

Net interest expense in the first quarter of 1995 was $1.6 million
above the comparable period of 1994 as higher short-term interest
expense and decreased capitalized interest were only slightly
offset by lower fixed interest expense and higher interest income. 
The 1995 increase in short-term interest reflected higher average
short-term borrowing rates, partially offset by lower borrowing
levels.  A cumulative decrease in expenditures qualifying for
interest capitalization resulted in lower capitalized interest in
1995. 

The first quarter effective income tax rate increased from 39.8% in
1994 to 40.2% in 1995.  The higher rate in 1995 was due primarily
to changes in the mix of the Corporation's income among various tax
jurisdictions.

Financial Condition

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
cash generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital
needs, which typically peak during the summer, generally have been
met by issuing commercial paper.  During the first three months of
1995, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.7
million.  Cash provided from operations was sufficient to finance
capital additions of $33.0 million, pay cash dividends of $27.7
million, reduce short-term borrowings by $12.7 million, repay long-
term debt of $5.4 million and fund share repurchases of $1.2
million.  The increase in cash provided from operations versus 1994
reflected changes in accounts receivable balances and the timing of
income tax payments.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.2:1 as of
April 2, 1995 and December 31, 1994.  The Corporation's
capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a


percent of stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was
24% as of April 2, 1995, and 25% as of December 31, 1994.  As of
April 2, 1995, the Corporation had $25.0 million of cash and cash

<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 8
equivalents, $3.1 million of current portion of long-term debt and
$304.0 million of short-term debt.  As of April 2, 1995 the
Corporation had lines of credit with domestic and international
commercial banks in the amount of approximately $525 million which
could be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of
commercial paper.  

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $106.1 million ($80.2 million after-tax or
$.92 per share).  The restructuring program is expected to be
completed in 1995 and result in annual savings of approximately
$18.0 million starting in 1996.

As of April 2, 1995, $100 million of debt securities remained
available for issuance under a Form S-3 Registration Statement
which was declared effective in June 1990 and an additional $400
million of debt securities under a Form S-3 Registration Statement
declared effective in November 1993.  Proceeds from any offering of
the $500 million of debt securities available under these shelf
registrations may be used to reduce existing commercial paper
borrowings, finance capital additions, and fund a share repurchase
program and future business acquisitions.

As of April 2, 1995, the Corporation's principal capital
commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion and
modernization.  The Corporation anticipates that capital
expenditures will be in the range of $125 million to $175 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of continued
modernization of existing facilities and capacity expansion to
support new products and line extensions.  

A total of 3,476,230 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased
for approximately $172.8 million under a share repurchase program. 
As of April 2, 1995, 3,212,230 shares were held as Treasury Stock.

                         ARTICLE I - STOCKHOLDERS

      Section 1.  ANNUAL MEETING.  The annual meeting of
stockholders shall be held on the last Monday in the month of
April, in each year, or, if that day be a legal holiday, on the
next succeeding business day not a legal holiday, or on such
other date as may be fixed by the Board of Directors and stated
in the notice of the meeting.  At the annual meeting, the
stockholders shall elect directors and transact such other
business as may properly be brought before such meeting.

      Section 2.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  A special meeting of the
stockholders may be called by the Board of Directors, the
Executive Committee of the Board of Directors or by stockholders
holding in the aggregate at least twenty-five percent of the
outstanding votes entitled to be cast by holders of the Common
Stock and the Class B Common Stock voting together without regard
to class on the date such meeting is called.

      Section 3.  PLACE OF MEETINGS.  All meetings of the
stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the
State of Delaware, as may from time to time be fixed by the Board
of Directors, or as shall be specified or fixed in the respective
notices or waivers of notice thereof.

      Section 4.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Notice of each meeting
of the stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given
not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date on
which the meeting is to be held to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote, by delivering a written or printed notice
thereof to him, personally, or by mailing such notice in a
postage prepaid envelope addressed to him at his post office
address registered with the Corporation.  No publication of any
notice of a meeting of stockholders shall be required.  Every
notice of a special meeting of stockholders, besides stating the
time and place of the meeting, shall state briefly the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called.

      Section 5.  WAIVER OF NOTICE.  Regardless of any other
provision herein, notice of any meeting of stockholders shall not
be required as to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting

<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 2
      Section 6.  QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE.  At any meeting
of stockholders at which any action is to be taken or questions
decided (including the election of directors), the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast at the meeting with respect to such action or
question shall constitute a quorum, provided, however, that at
such time as shares of the Class B Common Stock become
outstanding, with respect to the taking of any action or the
deciding of any question as to which either the Common Stock or
the Class B Common Stock is entitled to vote separately as a
class pursuant to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to
be cast by such class voting separately as a class at such
meeting shall constitute a quorum.  At every such meeting at
which a quorum is present for the taking of any action or the
deciding of any question, a majority of the votes present or
represented shall be necessary to take such action or decide such
question, with the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
voting together without regard to class or separately as a class
or classes as may be prescribed by the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, provided, however, that with
respect to the election of directors pursuant to the provisions
of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws,
the persons receiving the greatest number of votes, in descending
order, shall be elected for the positions to be filled.  The
absence of a quorum as provided for herein for the taking of any
one action or the deciding of any one question shall not prevent
the taking of any other action or the deciding of any other
question for which a quorum is present.

      Section 7.  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  The Corporation
shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or
more inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a
written report thereof.  The Corporation may designate one or
more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who
fails to act.  In the event that no inspector so appointed or
designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting.  Each inspector, before
entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and
sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability.  The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated
shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share,
(ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation
represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and
ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and
retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any
challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v)
certify their determination of the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such
inspectors' count of all votes and ballots.  Such certification 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 3
shall specify such other information as may be required by law. 
In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots
cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the
inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law.  No person who is a candidate for an office at an
election may serve as an inspector at such election.

      Section 8.  CONDUCT OF MEETINGS.  The date and time of
the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which
the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at
such meeting by the person presiding over the meeting.  The Board
of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such
rules, regulations or procedures for the conduct of meetings of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.  Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules, regulations or procedures as
adopted by the Board of Directors, the chair of any meeting of
stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such
rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in
the judgment of such chair, are appropriate for the proper
conduct of the meeting.  Such rules, regulations or procedures,
whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the
following:  (1) the establishment of an agenda or order of
business for the meeting; (2) rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present;
(3) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting
to the stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly
authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
chair shall permit; (4) restrictions on entry to the meeting
after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (5)
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants.  Unless, and to the extent determined by the Board
of Directors or the chair of the meeting, meetings of
stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with

requested to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder.  For

business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the

in this Section 9, Article I of these By-laws.  The chair of an
annual meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9 of these By-laws, and if he or she should so determine,
he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business
not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

either by an assignment in writing on the back of the

transfer the same, signed by the record holder thereof; but no
transfer shall affect the right of the Corporation to pay any
dividend upon the stock to the holder of record thereof, or to
treat the holder of record as the holder in fact thereof for all
purposes, and no transfer shall be valid, except between the
parties thereto, until such transfer shall have been made upon
the books of the Corporation.  

      Section 4.  LOST CERTIFICATES.  In case any certificate
of stock shall be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Board of
Directors, in its discretion, may authorize the issue of, or
provide for the manner of issuing, a substitute certificate in
place of the certificate so lost, stolen or destroyed; provided,
that, in each such case, the applicant for a substitute
certificate shall furnish to the Corporation and to such of its
Transfer Agents and Registrars as may require the same evidence
to their satisfaction, in their discretion, of the loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate and of the ownership thereof, and
also such security or indemnity as may be required by them.

      Section 5.  RECORD DATE.  The Board of Directors may
fix a record date for the purpose of determining the stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof; to receive payment of any dividend or

of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 
The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the purpose of
determining the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted by the Board of Directors, and shall not be more than
ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.

      Section 12.  COMPENSATION.  The compensation of all
elected officers of the Corporation shall be fixed by the Board

                       ARTICLE VI - INDEMNIFICATION

          Section 1.  GENERAL  The Corporation shall indemnify
and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the
Delaware General Corporation Law as it presently exists or may be
hereafter amended from time to time, any person who was or is
made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved
in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit,
arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative ("Proceeding") by reason of the fact that such
person, or a person for whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was 

          (a)  a director or officer of the Corporation or its
               subsidiaries, or 

          (b)  a director, officer or employee of the Corporation
               and is or was serving at the request of the
               Corporation through designation by the Chief
               Executive Officer as a director, officer,
               employee, agent or fiduciary of another
               corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
               trust, nonprofit entity or other enterprise,
               including service with respect to employee benefit
               plans, 

against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person or on
such person's behalf in connection with any such Proceeding. 
However, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person
in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was or is
authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

          Section 2.  ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.  The Corporation
shall pay the reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) as
and when incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in
connection with any Proceeding described in Section 1 in advance
of its final disposition, provided, however, that such payment
shall be made only upon a receipt of an undertaking by the 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 12
director or officer to repay all expenses (including attorneys'
fees) advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this
Article or otherwise.  Payment of such expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by employees of the Corporation may be
made by the Board of Directors in its discretion upon such terms
and conditions, if any, as it deems appropriate.

          Section 3.  RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE.  The rights conferred
on any person by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any
other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation, these By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise.  The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for by this Article VI shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer
or employee described in Section 1 and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

          Section 4.  CLAIMS.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Article VI, if a claim by a director, officer
or employee described in Section 1 for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not paid in full
within thirty days after a written claim therefor has been
received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to
recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid in full all costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such
claim.  In any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden
of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested
indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law
and this Article VI.

          Section 5.  OTHER INDEMNIFICATION.  The Corporation's
obligation to indemnify or advance expenses hereunder to a person
who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation (as
provided for in Section 1) as a director, officer, employee,
agent or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, nonprofit entity, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person is entitled
to and actually receives as indemnification or advancement of
expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, nonprofit entity, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise.

          Section 6.  AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.  Any repeal or
modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall
not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any
person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to or at
the time of such repeal or modification.

          Section 1.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  During any emergency
resulting from an attack on the United States or on a locality in
which the Corporation conducts its business or customarily holds
meetings of its Board of Directors or its stockholders or during
a nuclear or atomic disaster or during the existence of any
catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition (any of the
foregoing is hereinafter referred to as an "Emergency
Condition"), as a result of which a quorum of the Board of
Directors cannot readily be convened for action, then if at least
three members of the Executive Committee of the Board of
Directors are able and available, such members of the Executive
Committee shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute a quorum
of the Board of Directors, notwithstanding any limitations or
other provisions contained in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, these By-laws or resolutions of the Board of
Directors in effect at the time of the Emergency Condition.  If
at least three members of the Executive Committee are not able
and available to act as the Board of Directors under the
foregoing circumstances, then in addition to any director or
directors who are able and available, the elected officers of the
Corporation who are able and available shall be deemed, in order
of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, directors
to the extent required to constitute a quorum of three for any
meeting of the Board of Directors during such Emergency
Condition.

          Section 2.  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.  If as a result of
any Emergency Condition, the Chief Executive Officer is unable or
unavailable to act, then until the Chief Executive Officer
becomes able and available to act or a new Chief Executive
Officer is elected, the senior officer of the Corporation, in
order of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, who
is able and available to act shall act as Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation.

          Section 3.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  During an Emergency
Condition, a meeting of the Board of Directors may be called by
any director, and if none are able and available to do so, by any
elected officer of the Corporation, by notice of the time and
place given to such of the directors, or officers serving as
directors in accordance with this Article, as it may be feasible
to reach at the time and by such means as may be feasible at the
time, including publication or radio.

          Section 4.  POWERS DURING AN EMERGENCY CONDITION. 
During an Emergency Condition, the Board of Directors may take
any acts in good faith deemed necessary and in the best interests
of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, changing the
head office or designating several alternative head offices or
regional offices of the Corporation, or providing for and from
time to time modifying lines of succession in the event that 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 14
during any such Emergency Condition any or all officers or agents
of the Corporation shall for any reason be rendered incapable of
discharging their duties.

          Section 5.  LIABILITY.  No officer or director shall be
liable for any act taken in accordance with this Article during
an Emergency Condition, except for willful misconduct.

          Section 6.  EFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER BY-LAWS.  To the
extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article, the
other By-laws of the Corporation shall remain in effect during
any Emergency Condition and upon its termination, the provisions
of this Article shall cease to be operative.


                         ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENTS

          These By-laws may be amended or repealed, in whole or
in part, and new By-laws may be adopted, either by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
by the holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
voting together without regard to class, given at any meeting of
stockholders or by a consent, or by the affirmative vote of
two-thirds (calculated to the nearest whole number) of the total
number of directors constituting the Board of Directors, given at
any meeting of directors or by a consent.
