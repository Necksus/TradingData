                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION

        The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the
        accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of
        intercompany accounts and transactions. These statements have been
        prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not
        include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
        accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the
        opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal
        recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
        been included. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year
        amounts to conform to the 1998 presentation. Operating results for the
        three months and year-to-date ended October 4, 1998, are not necessarily
        indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
        December 31, 1998. For more information, refer to the consolidated
        financial statements and footnotes included in the Corporation's 1997
        Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2.      COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

        In  June  1997,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
        Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  130,  "Reporting
        Comprehensive  Income" (FAS No. 130). Under FAS No. 130, standards are
        established for reporting and display of comprehensive  income and its
        components in financial  statements.  Comprehensive income is reported
        in  the  Consolidated   Statements  of  Stockholder's   Equity.  Other
        comprehensive   income   represents   foreign   currency   translation
        adjustments. 

3.      INTEREST EXPENSE

6.      LONG-TERM DEBT

        In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due
        2007 (6.95% Notes) under the November 1993 Form S-3 Registration
        Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion
        of the commercial paper borrowings associated with the acquisition of
        the Leaf North America confectionery operations (Leaf) in December 1996.

        In August 1997, the Corporation filed another Form S-3 Registration
        Statement under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis,
        up to $500 million of additional debt securities. Also in August 1997,
        the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2012 (Notes) and
        $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 (Debentures) under the November
        1993 and August 1997 Registration Statements. Proceeds from the debt
        issuance were used to repay short-term borrowings associated with the
        purchase of Common Stock from the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for
        the benefit of Milton Hershey School (Milton Hershey School Trust). As
        of October 4, 1998, $250 million of debt securities remained available
        for issuance under the August 1997 Registration Statement. As of October
        4, 1998 and December 31, 1997, $150.0 million of commercial paper
        borrowings were reclassified as long-term debt in accordance with the
        Corporation's intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a
        long-term basis.

7.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
        equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt,
        including $150.0 million of commercial paper borrowings reclassified as
        long-term debt, approximated fair value as of October 4, 1998 and
        December 31, 1997, because of the relatively short maturity of these
        instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current
        portion, was $879.1 million as of October 4, 1998, compared to a fair
        value of $999.0 million, based on quoted market prices for the same or
        similar debt issues.

        As of October 4, 1998, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
        contracts maturing in 1998 and 1999 to purchase $23.3 million in foreign
        currency, primarily British sterling and Dutch gilders, and to sell
        $11.1 million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen and Canadian
        dollars, at contracted forward rates.

        To hedge foreign currency exposure related to anticipated transactions
        associated with the purchase of certain raw materials and finished
        goods, generally covering 3 to 24 months, the Corporation, from time to
        time, also purchases foreign exchange options which permit, but do not
        require, the Corporation to exchange foreign currencies at a future date
        with another party at a contracted exchange rate. As of December 31,
        1997, the Corporation had purchased foreign exchange options of $3.6
        million, related to Swiss francs. These options matured in early 1998
        and no foreign exchange options were outstanding as of October 4, 1998.



                                       10
<PAGE>




        The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
        obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
        necessary for maturity differences. As of October 4, 1998, the fair
        value of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated the contract
        value. The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for
        trading purposes.

        In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
        exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
        swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate
        debt to fixed rate debt. As of October 4, 1998, the Corporation had
        agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $75.0
        million, with maturities through 1999. As of October 4, 1998, interest
        rates payable were at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.3%, and the
        interest rate receivable was floating based on the 30-day commercial
        paper composite rate which was 5.6% as of October 4, 1998. Any interest
        rate differential on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment
        to interest expense over the term of each agreement. As of October 4,
        1998, the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximated the
        contract value. The Corporation's risk related to swap agreements is
        limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market
        rates.

8.      DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

        In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS No. 133). FAS No. 133
        establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
        derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an
        asset or liability measured at its fair value. FAS No. 133 requires that
        changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in
        earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
        accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses
        to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement,
        and requires that a company must formally document, designate, and
        assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

        FAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999,
        but may be implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after
        issuance. Retroactive application is not permitted. FAS No. 133 must be
        applied to (a) derivative instruments and (b) certain derivative
        instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued, acquired, or
        substantively modified after December 31, 1997. Changes in accounting
        methods will be required for derivative instruments utilized by the
        Corporation to hedge commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and
        interest rate risks. Such derivatives include, but are not limited to,
        commodity futures and options contracts, foreign exchange forward and
        options contracts and interest rate swaps.

        The Corporation anticipates the adoption of FAS No. 133 as of January 1,
        2000, and is presently analyzing methods for implementing and complying
        with this complex pronouncement. As of October 4, 1998, the Corporation
        had not quantified the impact of adopting FAS No. 133. However, the
        implementation of FAS No. 133 could increase volatility in earnings and
        other comprehensive income.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THIRD QUARTER 1998 VS. THIRD QUARTER 1997
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter increased from $1,151.6 million in
1997 to $1,217.2 million in 1998, an increase of 6% from the prior year. The
higher sales primarily reflected incremental sales from the introduction of new
confectionery products and higher sales of core confectionery and grocery
products. These increases were offset somewhat by the impact of currency
exchange rates in the Canadian and Mexican markets, lower sales of core pasta
products and sales declines in international markets, particularly Asia.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 41.6% in 1997 to 42.0% in 1998. The
increase was primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of
reduced costs associated with aged and obsolete inventories of seasonal products
and products sold in conjunction with special theme promotions. These increases
were partially offset by higher costs for certain major raw materials, primarily
milk and cocoa. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased by 7%,
primarily reflecting higher marketing expenses for existing products and
increased spending associated with the introduction of new products.

Net interest expense in the third quarter of 1998 was $2.1 million above the
comparable period of 1997 primarily as a result of increased borrowings
associated with the purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School
Trust, offset somewhat by lower interest expense reflecting reduced average
short-term borrowings.

The third quarter effective income tax rate decreased from 39.3% in 1997 to
39.0% in 1998 primarily as a result of changes in the mix of the Corporation's
income among various tax jurisdictions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST NINE MONTHS 1998 VS. FIRST NINE MONTHS 1997
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 1998 increased by $135.9
million or 4% primarily as a result of incremental sales from the introduction
of new confectionery products and increased sales of core confectionery and
grocery products. These increases were offset somewhat by a decline in sales in
the Corporation's Asian and Russian markets and the impact of currency exchange
rates in the Canadian and Mexican markets.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.4% in 1997 to 41.1% in 1998. The
decrease was primarily due to lower profitability resulting from higher costs
for certain major raw materials, primarily milk and cocoa, labor and overhead,
in addition to the mix of non-chocolate and chocolate confectionery items sold
in 1998 compared to 1997. These cost increases were partially offset by improved
manufacturing efficiencies associated primarily with production of the acquired
Leaf brands and lower costs for packaging and certain minor raw materials.
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 2% higher than 1997, as
higher marketing expenses associated with the introduction of new products were
partially offset by reduced marketing expenses for existing brands and lower
selling expenses in international markets.


                                       12
<PAGE>



Net interest expense was $14.1 million above prior year, primarily as a result
of increased borrowings associated with the purchase of Common Stock from the
Milton Hershey School Trust, partially offset by lower interest expense
reflecting reduced average short-term borrowings.

The effective  income tax rate  decreased  from 39.3% in 1997 to 39.0% in 1998  
primarily due to changes in the mix of the Corporation's income among various 
tax jurisdictions.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper. During the first nine months of 1998, the Corporation's cash and cash
equivalents decreased by $14.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents on hand at the
beginning of the period, cash provided from operations and short-term borrowings
were sufficient to finance capital and capitalized software additions of $147.2
million, pay cash dividends of $95.4 million and to repay $25.1 million of
long-term debt.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.4:1 as of October 4,
1998, and 1.3:1 as of December 31, 1997. The Corporation's capitalization ratio
(total short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders' equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 58% as of October 4, 1998, and 60% as of
December 31, 1997.

As of October 4, 1998, the Corporation maintained a committed credit facility
agreement with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $600 million which could be
borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper. The
Corporation has the option to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with
the concurrence of the banks. The Corporation also had lines of credit with
domestic and international commercial banks in the amount of approximately $20
million as of October 4, 1998 and December 31, 1997.

In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes under a
November 1993 Registration Statement. In August 1997, the Corporation issued
$150 million of Notes and $250 million of Debentures under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration Statements. As of October 4, 1998, $250 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration
Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250 million of debt securities
available under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate
requirements, which include reducing existing commercial paper borrowings,
financing capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.

As of October 4, 1998, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization. The Corporation anticipates
that capital expenditures will be in the range of $165 million to $200 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of continued modernization
of existing facilities and capacity expansion to support new products and line
extensions.

<PAGE>





The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and
interest rate swaps resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not material as of October 4, 1998. The market
risk resulting from a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent
associated with the estimated average fair value of net commodity positions
declined from $9.6 million as of December 31, 1997, to $7.6 million as of
October 4, 1998. Market risk represents 10% of the estimated average fair value
of net commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period. The
decrease in average market risk was primarily related to changes in the excess
of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts in 1998
compared to 1997.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES
- ----------------

Year 2000 issues associated with information systems relate to the way dates are
recorded and computed in many computer systems. These year 2000 issues could
have an impact upon the Corporation's information technology (IT) and non-IT
systems. Non-IT systems include embedded technology such as microcontrollers
which are integral to the operation of most machinery and equipment.
Additionally, year 2000 issues could have a similar impact on the Corporation's
major business partners, including both customers and suppliers. While it is not
currently possible to estimate the total impact of a failure of either the
Corporation or its major business partners or suppliers to complete their year
2000 remediation in a timely manner, the Corporation has determined that it
could suffer significant adverse financial consequences as a result of such
failure.

Awareness of year 2000 issues regarding major business applications software and
other  significant  IT  systems  began in 1990.  A formal  program to assess and
address  year 2000 issues  associated  with IT systems was  established  in late
1995.  The  Corporation  expects  that  remediation  of  these  systems  will be
essentially  completed by the third  quarter of 1999.  In early 1998, a team was
established  with  representatives  from  all  major  functional  areas  of  the
Corporation which assumed overall  responsibility  for ensuring that remediation
of both IT and non-IT  systems  will be  completed  in time to prevent  material
adverse  consequences  to the  Corporation's  business,  operations or financial
condition.

In late 1996, the Corporation approved a project to implement an enterprise-wide
integrated  information  system to improve  process  efficiencies  in all of the
major  functional  areas of the  Corporation  which is  expected  to enable  the
Corporation to provide better service to its customers. This system will replace
most of the transaction  systems and applications  supporting  operations of the
Corporation. The system is year 2000 compliant and will address year 2000 issues
for approximately 80% of the Corporation's business applications software. As of
October 4, 1998,  configuration of this system was  approximately  60% complete,
with  full  implementation   expected  by  the  third  quarter  of  1999.  Total
commitments  for this  system are  expected to be in the range of $80 million to
$90 million  which will be  financed  with cash  provided  from  operations  and
short-term  borrowings.  As of October 4, 1998,  approximately  $48.8 million of
capitalized  software  and  hardware  and $5.5  million  of  expenses  have been
incurred for this project.

                                       14
<PAGE>



The Corporation's mainframe, network and desktop hardware and software have
recently been upgraded and are substantially year 2000 compliant. The
Corporation is in the process of remediating year 2000 compliance issues
associated with legacy information systems not being replaced by the integrated
information system project, including process, automation and factory management
systems, as well as non-IT systems. As of October 4, 1998, remediation of IT
systems was approximately 75% complete and approximately 85% of non-IT systems
were determined to be year 2000 compliant or have been remediated. The total
cost to complete remediation of IT and non-IT systems is expected to be in the
range of $6.0 million to $8.0 million.

The Corporation is also in the process of assessing year 2000 remediation issues
relating to its major third party business partners. All of the Corporation's
major customers have been contacted regarding year 2000 issues related to
electronic data interchange (EDI). As of October 4, 1998, no major customer or
supplier remediation issues have been identified which would significantly
impact EDI transactions. The Corporation is also in the process of contacting
its major suppliers of ingredients, packaging, facilities and logistics services
with regard to year 2000 issues. Because of the uncertainties associated with
assessing the ability of major business partners to complete the remediation of
their systems in time to prevent operational difficulties, the Corporation will
continue to contact and/or visit major customers and suppliers to gain
assurances that no significant adverse consequences will result due to their
failure to complete remediation of their systems.

Year 2000 remediation, conversion, validation and implementation is continuing
and, at the present time, it is expected that remediation to both the
Corporation's IT and non-IT systems and those of major business partners will be
completed in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the Corporation's
business, operations or financial condition. However, contingency plans will be
developed as needed and, to the extent possible, for any potential systems
failures resulting from year 2000 issues.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS
- -------------------------------------

The 1999 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on April 27, 1999. To be
eligible for inclusion in the Corporation's Proxy Statement for the 1999 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, stockholder proposals must be received by the
Corporation by November 16, 1998.

In accordance with the Corporation's By-Laws, stockholders (other than those
holding 25% of the outstanding votes entitled to be cast) who do not submit
proposals for inclusion in the Proxy Statement but who intend to present a
proposal, nomination for director or other business for consideration at any
meeting of stockholders, including any Annual Meeting, are required to notify
the Secretary of the Corporation of their proposal or nomination and provide
other information in advance of such meeting. Stockholders interested in making
proposals at the 1999 Annual Meeting should submit their name and address, their
shareholdings, a brief description of the proposal, and any financial or other

              Hershey Foods Exploring Sale of U.S. Pasta Business


Hershey,  Pa. -- Hershey Foods Corporation  announced today that it is exploring
the possible sale of its U.S. pasta  business and that Goldman,  Sachs & Co. has
been engaged to assist in this process.

Hershey, through its Hershey Pasta and Grocery Group, holds the number-one share
position in the U.S. branded dry pasta category. Its eight regional brands
include American Beauty, Ideal by San Giorgio, Light 'n Fluffy, P&R, Mrs. Weiss,
Ronzoni, San Giorgio and Skinner pasta. In 1997, combined sales for Hershey's
pasta business were $400 million.

"Hershey Foods has been involved in the pasta business since 1966 and today
enjoys the leadership position in the U.S. branded dry pasta category. Over the
years, this business has provided profitable growth and good cash flow for the
corporation. After a thorough review of our strategic direction, we believe that
we can generate a better return for our shareholders by focusing resources on
our confectionery and related grocery and foodservice businesses," said Kenneth
L. Wolfe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hershey Foods.
