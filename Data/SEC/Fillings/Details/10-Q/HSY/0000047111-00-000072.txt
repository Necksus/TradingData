5.       LONG-TERM DEBT
         In August 1997, the Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement
         under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to
         $500 million of additional debt securities. As of April 2, 2000, $250
         million of debt securities remained available for issuance under the
         August 1997 Registration Statement.

6.       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
         The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
         equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
         approximated fair value as of April 2, 2000 and December 31, 1999,
         because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The
         carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was
         $878.1 million as of April 2, 2000, compared to a fair value of $864.3
         million, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt
         issues.

         As of April 2, 2000, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
         contracts maturing in 2000 and 2001 to purchase $28.7 million in
         foreign currency, primarily British sterling, and to sell $24.9 million
         in foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at
         contracted forward rates.

         The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
         obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted
         where necessary for maturity differences. As of April 2, 2000, the fair
         value of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated the contract
         value. The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for
         trading purposes.

         In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
         exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
         swap agreements. In October 1999, the Corporation entered into an
         interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert $200 million of
         6.7% Notes Due 2005 (Notes) to variable rate debt. The interest rate
         swap agreement is cancelable at the sole discretion of the counterparty
         effective April 2, 2001. At the same time, the Corporation entered into
         forward interest rate agreements to fix the interest rate on the Notes
         at 5.8% through April 2, 2001. Subsequently, if the counterparty
         chooses not to cancel the agreement, the interest rate on the Notes
         would be variable based on the London Interbank Offered Rate until
         expiration on October 1, 2005.

                                       7
<PAGE>


         Any interest rate differential on interest rate swaps and forward
         agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the
         term of each agreement. As of April 2, 2000, the fair value of interest
         rate swaps and forward agreements approximated the contract value. The
         Corporation's risk related to swaps and forward agreements is limited
         to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates.

7.       DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
         In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
         of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
         INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133
         establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
         derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an
         asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires
         that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in
         earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
         accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses
         to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement,
         and requires that a company must formally document, designate, and
         assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

         SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
         2000, but may be implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter
         after issuance. Retroactive application is not permitted. SFAS No. 133
         must be applied to (a) derivative instruments and (b) certain
         derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued,
         acquired, or substantively modified after December 31, 1997. Changes in
         accounting methods will be required for derivative instruments utilized
         by the Corporation to hedge commodity price, foreign currency exchange
         rate and interest rate risks. Such derivatives include commodity
         futures contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate
         swaps and forward agreements.

         The Corporation anticipates the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January
         1, 2001. As of April 2, 2000, net deferred losses on derivatives of
         approximately $39.0 million after tax would have been reported as a
         component of other comprehensive loss and classified as accumulated
         other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets upon
         adoption of SFAS No. 133. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected
         to have a material impact on the Corporation's results of operations.

8.       SHARE REPURCHASES
         A total of 572,553 shares of Common Stock was purchased during the
         first quarter of 2000 under the share repurchase program begun in
         February 1999, completing the $230 million program. In October 1999,
         the Corporation's Board of Directors approved an additional share
         repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of
         the Corporation's Common Stock. Under this new program, a total of
         739,547 shares of Common Stock was purchased during the first quarter
         of 2000. As of April 2, 2000, a total of 42,802,415 shares were held as
         Treasury Stock and $168.9 million remained available for repurchases of
         Common Stock under the repurchase program approved in October.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER 2000 VS. FIRST QUARTER 1999
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the first quarter increased from $945.2 million in
1999 to $993.1 million in 2000, an increase of 5% from the prior year. The
higher sales primarily reflected an increased sales volume for core
confectionery and grocery products in North America resulting from strong
seasonal sales for Easter. The first quarter of 1999 included $29.3 million in
net sales related to the Corporation's pasta business which was divested in late
January 1999.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 40.5% in 1999 to 39.1% in 2000.
Gross margin in 1999 benefited 1.7 percentage points primarily from the
inclusion in cost of sales of a one-time $12.5 million gain from revisions to
the Corporation's retiree medical plan, net of additional costs for supplemental
retirement contributions into the Employee Savings Stock Investment and
Ownership  Plan.  Excluding  the  one-time  gain in 1999,  the increase in gross
margin  reflected  decreased  costs for certain major raw  materials,  primarily
cocoa, as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies. These cost decreases were
offset  partially by higher freight and warehousing  costs,  and increased costs
for obsolete  packaging and the disposal of aged inventory.  Selling,  marketing
and administrative  expenses decreased by 5% in 2000,  primarily  reflecting the
divestiture of the Corporation's pasta business.  Administrative expense in 2000
benefited from the inclusion of a one-time gain of $7.3 million arising from the
exchange of certain corporate  aircraft.  This gain was substantially  offset by
higher administrative expenses and software amortization costs.

Net interest expense in the first quarter of 2000 was $.9 million below the
comparable period of 1999, primarily as a result of the interest rate swap and
forward agreements entered into in October 1999.

Net income for the first quarter was $71.2 million compared to $224.7 million in
1999, and net income per share - diluted was $.51 per share compared to $1.57
per share in the prior year. Prior year net income included an after-tax gain of
$165.0 million, or $1.15 per share - diluted, on the sale of the Corporation's
pasta business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -------------------------------

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper. During the first quarter of 2000, the Corporation's cash and cash
equivalents decreased by $71.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents on hand at the
beginning of the period and cash provided from operations were sufficient to
repurchase $55.3 million of the Corporation's Common Stock, pay cash dividends
of $35.2 million, reduce short-term debt by $34.6 million and finance capital
expenditures and capitalized software additions of $31.7 million.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.9:1 as of April 2,
2000, and 1.8:1 as of December 31, 1999. The Corporation's capitalization ratio
(total short-term and long-term debt as a percentage of stockholder's equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 49% as of April 2, 2000, and 50% as of
December 31, 1999.

                                       9
<PAGE>

As of April 2, 2000, the Corporation maintained a committed credit facility
agreement with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $500.0 million which could
be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper. The
Corporation has the option to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with
the concurrence of the banks. The Corporation also had lines of credit with
domestic and international commercial banks in the amount of approximately $25.0
million as of April 2, 2000 and December 31, 1999.

In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes under a
November 1993 Registration Statement. In August 1997, the Corporation issued
$150 million of Notes and $250 million of Debentures under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration Statements. As of April 2, 2000, $250 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration
Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250 million of debt securities
available under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate
requirements, which include reducing existing commercial paper borrowings,
financing capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.

As of April 2, 2000, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included
manufacturing capacity expansion, modernization and efficiency improvements. The
Corporation anticipates that capital expenditures will be in the range of $150
million to $170 million per annum during the next several years as a result of
continued modernization of existing facilities and capacity expansion to support
new products and line extensions. Such expenditures will be financed with cash
provided from operations and short-term borrowings.

In July 1999, the Corporation entered into an operating lease agreement for an
amount not to exceed $65 million for the purpose of financing construction costs
of a warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the
Corporation near Hershey, Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor pays for
the construction costs and thereafter leases the facility to the Corporation.
The lease term is six years, including the construction period. The lease may be
extended at the Corporation's option for up to four renewal periods of five
years each. The lease provides for a substantial residual guarantee and includes
an option to purchase the facility at original cost. Inventory shipments into
the first phase of the distribution center began in May 2000.

The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and
interest rate swaps resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not material as of April 2, 2000. The market
risk resulting from a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent
associated with the estimated average fair value of net commodity positions
decreased from $11.1 million as of December 31, 1999, to $9.4 million as of
April 2, 2000. Market risk represents 10% of the estimated average fair value of
net commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES
- ----------------

The Corporation completed its year 2000 testing and remediation programs in the
third quarter of 1999. No significant year 2000 problems have been encountered
with the Corporation's information technology (IT) and non-IT systems or with
the Corporation's major business partners.

                                       10
<PAGE>

The total cost of testing and  remediation  of the  Corporation's  IT and non-IT
systems not being  replaced by the  integrated  information  system  project was
approximately $6.0 million.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
- ---------------------

The nature of the Corporation's operations and the environment in which it
operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In connection with the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the
Corporation notes the following factors which, among others, could cause future
results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations
and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Many of the forward looking
statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of
forward-looking words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "should,"
"planned," "estimated," and "potential" among others. Factors which could cause
results to differ include, but are not limited to: changes in the confectionery
and grocery business environment, including actions of competitors and changes
in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws and regulations, including
income taxes; market demand for new and existing products; raw material pricing;
the Corporation's ability to fully remedy the problems and avoid the increased
costs encountered since implementing changes to the customer service,
warehousing, and order fulfillment processes and systems in the third quarter of
1999; the ability to restore customer service to historical levels; the effects
service levels and other factors have on future customer demand; and the ability
to complete construction and commence operations of new warehousing facilities
on schedule.

                           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEMS 2, 3 AND 5 HAVE BEEN OMITTED AS NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- --------------------------

In January 1999, the Corporation received a Notice of Proposed Deficiency
(Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to the years 1989
through 1996. The most significant issue pertains to the Corporate Owned Life
Insurance (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The
IRS proposed an assessment for the disallowance of interest expense deductions
associated with the underlying life insurance policies. The total impact of the
disallowance was approximately $61.4 million, including interest as of April 2,
2000. The Corporation may be subject to additional assessments for federal and
state tax and interest payments for years 1997 and 1998. The Corporation
believes that it has fully complied with the tax law as it relates to its COLI
program. The Corporation filed a protest of the proposed deficiency with the
Appeals section of the IRS in April 1999 and continues to vigorously defend its
position on this matter. The Corporation has no other material pending legal
proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.
