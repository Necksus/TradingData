5.      LONG-TERM DEBT

        In August 1997, the Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration  Statement
        under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $500
        million of  additional  debt  securities.  As of  October 3, 1999,  $250
        million of debt  securities  remained  available for issuance  under the
        August 1997 Registration Statement.

6.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The carrying  amounts of financial  instruments  including cash and cash
        equivalents,  accounts receivable,  accounts payable and short-term debt
        approximated  fair value as of October 3, 1999 and  December  31,  1998,
        because of the  relatively  short  maturity  of these  instruments.  The
        carrying value of long-term  debt,  including the current  portion,  was
        $880.8 million as of October 3, 1999, compared to a fair value of $877.6
        million,  based on quoted  market  prices for the same or  similar  debt
        issues.

        As of October 3, 1999,  the  Corporation  had foreign  exchange  forward
        contracts maturing in 1999 and 2000 to purchase $20.9 million in foreign
        currency,  primarily  British  sterling,  and to sell  $34.7  million in
        foreign  currency,  primarily  Canadian  dollars  and  Japanese  yen, at
        contracted forward rates.

        The fair value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  is estimated by
        obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
        necessary  for  maturity  differences.  As of October 3, 1999,  the fair
        value of foreign  exchange forward  contracts  approximated the contract
        value. The Corporation does not hold or issue financial  instruments for
        trading purposes.

        In order to minimize its  financing  costs and to manage  interest  rate
        exposure, the Corporation,  from time to time, enters into interest rate
        swap  agreements to  effectively  convert a portion of its floating rate
        debt to fixed rate debt. As of October 3, 1999, the  Corporation  had no
        such agreements outstanding.

7.      DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

        In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
        of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  ACCOUNTING  FOR DERIVATIVE
        INSTRUMENTS  AND  HEDGING  ACTIVITIES  (SFAS  No.  133).  SFAS  No.  133
        establishes  accounting  and reporting  standards  requiring  that every
        derivative  instrument  be recorded  in the  balance  sheet as either an
        asset or  liability  measured at its fair value.  SFAS No. 133  requires
        that changes in the derivative's  fair value be recognized  currently in
        earnings  unless  specific hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Special
        accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's  gains and losses
        to offset  related  results on the hedged item in the income  statement,
        and  requires  that a company must  formally  document,  designate,  and
        assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

        The  effective  date for SFAS No. 133 has been  deferred to fiscal years
        beginning  after  June  15,  2000,  but  may  be  implemented  as of the
        beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance.


                                       10
<PAGE>

        Retroactive application is not  permitted.  SFAS  No.  133  must be
        applied  to (a)  derivative instruments and (b) certain  derivative
        instruments  embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued,  acquired,
        or substantively  modified after December 31, 1997.

        Changes  in   accounting   methods  will  be  required  for   derivative
        instruments  utilized  by the  Corporation  to  hedge  commodity  price,
        foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks. Such derivatives
        include  commodity  futures  and  options  contracts,  foreign  exchange
        forward and options contracts and interest rate swaps.

        The  Corporation  anticipates the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January
        1, 2001. As of October 3, 1999,  net deferred  losses on  derivatives of
        approximately  $32.0  million  after tax would have been  reported  as a
        component of other  comprehensive  loss and  classified  as  accumulated
        other  comprehensive  loss  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  upon
        adoption of SFAS No. 133.

8.      SHARE REPURCHASES

        A total of  1,963,089  shares of Common Stock was  purchased  during the
        first quarter of 1999 under the share repurchase  program begun in 1996,
        completing the $200 million program. In February 1999, the Corporation's
        Board of  Directors  approved an  additional  share  repurchase  program
        authorizing  the  repurchase of up to $230 million of the  Corporation's
        Common Stock. Under this program,  the Corporation  purchased  1,579,779
        shares of its Common Stock from Hershey  Trust  Company,  as Trustee for
        the benefit of Milton Hershey School, and an additional 1,776,711 shares
        through open market  transactions  during the first nine months of 1999.
        As of  October  3,  1999,  a total of  41,436,416  shares  were  held as
        Treasury Stock and $32.2 million  remained  available for repurchases of
        Common Stock under the repurchase  program approved in February 1999. In
        October  1999,  the  Corporation's   Board  of  Directors   approved  an
        additional share repurchase program  authorizing the repurchase of up to
        $200 million of the  Corporation's  Common Stock,  to be initiated  upon
        completion of the February 1999 repurchase program.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
           FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THIRD QUARTER 1999 VS. THIRD QUARTER 1998
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated  net sales for the third quarter fell from $1,217.2 million in 1998
to $1,066.7  million in 1999,  a decrease of 12% from the prior year.  The sales
decline  reflected  reduced  shipments in the United States of confectionery and
grocery products resulting from problems in order fulfillment (customer service,
warehousing,  and  shipping)  encountered  since  the  July  start-up  of a  new
integrated  information system and new business processes,  in addition to lower
sales  resulting  from the  divestiture of the  Corporation's  pasta business in
January 1999. The sales decrease was partially offset by incremental  sales from
the introduction of new confectionery products.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 42.0% in 1998 to 40.6% in 1999. The
decrease  reflected reduced  manufacturing  efficiency and fixed cost absorption
resulting primarily from sales volume declines,  higher freight and distribution
costs  associated with  difficulties  arising from the new business  systems and
processes  and  with  distribution  center  capacity  constraints,   and  higher
depreciation  expense as a percentage of sales. These cost increases were offset
partially by reduced costs for raw materials and packaging.

Selling,  marketing  and  administrative  expenses  decreased by 14%,  primarily
reflecting  lower expenses  related to the divestiture of the pasta business and
decreased marketing expenditures for core confectionery brands, partially offset
by higher amortization  expense for capitalized software and increased marketing
for the introduction of new products and development of international markets.

Net interest  expense in the third  quarter of 1999 was $2.2  million  below the
comparable  period of 1998,  primarily as a result of lower short-term  interest
expense as a portion of the  proceeds  from the sale of the pasta  business  was
used to reduce short-term borrowings.

The third quarter effective income tax rate was 39.0% in 1999 and 1998.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST NINE MONTHS 1999 VS. FIRST NINE MONTHS 1998
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated  net sales for the first nine  months of 1999  decreased  by $330.6
million or 10%,  primarily as a result of the  divestiture of the  Corporation's
pasta  business and sales  decreases in the United States of core  confectionery
and grocery  products early in the year and particularly in the third quarter as
a result of the problems encountered since the July start-up of the new business
systems and processes. These sales declines were partially offset by incremental
sales from the introduction of new  confectionery  products and increased export
sales in international markets.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.1% in 1998 to 40.4% in 1999. The
decrease reflected lower  profitability  resulting from the mix of confectionery
items sold in 1999  compared  with sales during the  comparable  period of 1998,
primarily  related to lower sales of the more profitable  standard bars.  Higher
freight  and  distribution  costs,  reflecting  increased  costs  related to the
implementation  of new business  systems and processes and  distribution  center
capacity  constraints,  and higher depreciation expense as a percentage of sales
also  contributed  to the lower  gross  margin

                                       12
<PAGE>


in the  first  nine  months  of 1999.  These  cost  increases  were  offset
partially by decreased  costs for  packaging  materials  and raw materials and a
one-time benefit from revisions to the Corporation's retiree medical program.

Selling,  marketing and  administrative  expenses  decreased by 11%,  reflecting
lower expenses  resulting from the  divestiture of the pasta  business,  reduced
marketing  expenses  for core  confectionery  brands  and  lower  administrative
expenses. These decreases were offset partially by increased spending associated
with the introduction of new products and international  exports, in addition to
higher amortization expense for capitalized software.

Net interest  expense was $10.2  million  below the  comparable  period of 1998,
primarily as a result of lower  short-term  interest expense as a portion of the
proceeds  from the sale of the  pasta  business  was used to  reduce  short-term
borrowings.

Excluding the provision for income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of
the pasta business, the effective income tax rate was 39.0% in 1999 and 1998.

In January  1999,  the  Corporation  recorded a gain of $243.8  million,  $165.0
million  or $1.16  per  share -  diluted  after  tax,  on the sale of its  pasta
business.  Excluding  the after-tax  gain on the sale,  net income for the first
nine months of 1999 of $197.3 million was 15% below the comparable period of the
prior year and net income per share - diluted  excluding the after-tax  gain was
$1.39 per share or $.20 per share below 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -------------------------------

Historically,  the  Corporation's  major  source  of  financing  has  been  cash
generated from  operations.  Domestic  seasonal  working  capital  needs,  which
typically peak during the summer,  generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper.  During the first nine months of 1999,  the  Corporation's  cash and cash
equivalents  increased by $3.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents on hand at the
beginning of the period,  cash provided from  operating  activities and proceeds
from the divestiture of the pasta business were sufficient to repurchase  $310.3
million of the  Corporation's  Common Stock,  finance capital  expenditures  and
capitalized  software  additions  of $113.4  million and pay cash  dividends  of
$101.5 million.

An increase in inventories of $120.6 million primarily reflected higher finished
goods  inventories  resulting  from reduced  sales in the third  quarter of 1999
associated with problems  encountered  with the start-up of new business systems
and  processes.  An increase in accounts  receivable of $57.1 million was due to
the  timing of sales in  September  and to  difficulties  with the new  business
systems and  processes,  which  resulted in delays in receiving  payment  and/or
increased  deductions from invoiced  amounts from certain  customers  (including
penalties and fees which the Corporation is contesting).

The ratio of current  assets to current  liabilities  was 1.6:1 as of October 3,
1999, and 1.4:1 as of December 31, 1998. The Corporation's  capitalization ratio
(total  short-term  and  long-term  debt as a percent of  stockholders'  equity,
short-term  and  long-term  debt) was 54% as of October 3, 1999 and December 31,
1998.

                                       13
<PAGE>

As of October 3, 1999, the  Corporation  maintained a committed  credit facility
agreement  with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $576.8 million which could
be borrowed  directly or used to support the issuance of commercial  paper.  The
Corporation  has the option to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with
the  concurrence  of the banks.  The  Corporation  also had lines of credit with
domestic and international commercial banks in the amount of approximately $24.5
million as of October 3, 1999 and $23.0 as of December 31, 1998.

In March  1997,  the  Corporation  issued  $150  million of 6.95%  Notes under a
November 1993  Registration  Statement.  In August 1997, the Corporation  issued
$150 million of Notes and $250 million of Debentures under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration Statements. As of October 3, 1999, $250 million of debt
securities  remained  available for issuance under the August 1997  Registration
Statement.  Proceeds  from any offering of the $250  million of debt  securities
available  under  the  shelf  registration  may be used  for  general  corporate
requirements,  which include  reducing  existing  commercial  paper  borrowings,
financing  capital  additions,  and funding  future  business  acquisitions  and
working capital requirements.

In  January  1999,   the   Corporation   implemented   the  first  phase  of  an
enterprise-wide  integrated  information  system in the United States. The first
phase of system  implementation  included  new  business  systems and  processes
related to  purchasing,  accounts  payable,  fixed assets,  the general  ledger,
production  reporting,  and tracking of plant  inventories.  The start-up of the
second phase of system implementation began on July 5, 1999 and included systems
and processes in the areas of sales order and billing,  transportation  planning
and management,  electronic data  interchange  communications  with  warehouses,
finished  goods  inventories,  accounts  receivable  and  tracking of  marketing
promotions.  As of October 3, 1999,  approximately  $95.9 million of capitalized
software and hardware and $10.2  million of expenses  have been incurred for the
enterprise-wide  information system and related projects.  Total commitments for
these  systems are expected to be  approximately  $115 million to $120  million,
including  incremental  costs to resolve the system and process issues discussed
above and below.  These  expenditures  will be financed  with cash provided from
operations and short-term borrowings.

In July, the Corporation entered into an operating lease agreement for an amount
not to exceed $65 million for the purpose of financing  construction  costs of a
warehouse and  distribution  facility  located on land owned by the  Corporation
near  Hershey,  Pennsylvania.  Under  the  agreement,  the  lessor  pays for the
construction  costs and thereafter  leases the facility to the Corporation.  The
lease term is six years. The lease provides for a substantial residual guarantee
and  includes an option to purchase  the  facility at original  cost.  The first
phase of the  distribution  center is expected to open in the second  quarter of
2000.

As of October 3, 1999, the Corporation's  principal capital commitments included
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization.  The Corporation anticipates
that capital  expenditures  will be in the range of $150 million to $170 million
per annum during the next several  years as a result of continued  modernization
of existing  facilities and capacity  expansion to support new products and line
extensions.   Such  expenditures  will  be  financed  with  cash  provided  from
operations and short-term borrowings.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES
- ----------------

Year 2000 issues associated with information systems relate to the way dates are
recorded and  computed in many  computer  systems.  These year 2000 issues could
have an impact upon the  Corporation's  information  technology  (IT) and non-IT
systems.  Non-IT systems include  embedded  technology such as  microcontrollers
which  are  integral  to  the  operation  of  most   machinery  and   equipment.
Additionally,  year 2000 issues could have a similar impact on the Corporation's
major business partners, including both customers and suppliers. While it is not
currently  possible  to  estimate  the total  impact of a failure  of either the
Corporation or its major  business  partners or suppliers to complete their year
2000  remediation in a timely manner,  the  Corporation  has determined  that it
could suffer  significant  adverse  financial  consequences  as a result of such
failure.

Awareness  and  assessment  of  year  2000  issues   regarding   major  business
applications  software and other  significant IT systems began in 1990. A formal
program to address year 2000 issues  associated  with IT systems was established
in late 1995. In early 1998, a team was established  with  representatives  from
all  major   functional   areas  of  the   Corporation   which  assumed  overall
responsibility  for ensuring that  remediation of both the  Corporation's IT and
non-IT  systems  would  be  completed  in  time  to  prevent   material  adverse
consequences to the Corporation's  business,  operations or financial condition.
The team developed and implemented  year 2000 testing and  remediation  programs
which in some  cases  relied  upon year 2000  certification  from key  equipment
vendors.  As of  October  3,  1999,  the  Corporation's  year 2000  testing  and
remediation  programs were essentially  complete.  The total cost of testing and
remediation of the Corporation's IT and non-IT systems not being replaced by the
integrated  information  system  project is  expected to be in the range of $6.0
million to $8.0 million.

The Corporation has also assessed year 2000  remediation  issues relating to its
major business  partners.  All of the  Corporation's  major  customers have been
contacted regarding year 2000 issues related to electronic data interchange. The
Corporation  has also  contacted  all of its  major  suppliers  of  ingredients,
packaging, facilities, logistics and financial services with regard to year 2000
issues.  The information  provided to-date by the  Corporation's  major business
partners indicates that overall their year 2000 remediation efforts, if properly
executed,   should  not  result  in  material   adverse   consequences   to  the
Corporation's  business,  operations or financial condition as a whole. However,
contingency plans have been developed,  including  increases in raw material and
finished goods inventory levels, and the  identification of alternative  vendors
and suppliers.  The Corporation has  participated  in  industry-wide  efforts to
develop  contingency plans which, to the extent feasible,  may be relied upon to
resolve any potential failures resulting from year 2000 issues.  Operational and
incident specific contingency plans are being finalized within the context of an
overall business  continuity  contingency plan for all major functional areas of
the Corporation.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT
- ----------------

In October 1999, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert $200 million of 6.7% Notes due 2005 (Notes) to variable rate
debt. The interest rate swap  agreement is cancelable at the sole  discretion of
the  counterparty  effective  April 2, 2001. At the same time,  the  Corporation
entered into forward  interest  rate  agreements to fix the interest rate on the
Notes at 5.8%

                                       15
<PAGE>

through April 2, 2001.  Subsequently,  if the counterparty chooses not to cancel
the  agreement,  the interest  rate on the Notes would be variable  based on the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) until expiration on October 1, 2005.


FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
- ---------------------------

As indicated  previously,  the Corporation's  sales and earnings declined in the
third quarter of 1999 primarily as a result of problems with the start-up of new
business systems and processes in the areas of customer service, warehousing and
order fulfillment  encountered  during the  Corporation's  peak shipping season.
These problems resulted in lost sales,  longer  turnaround times,  significantly
increased  freight and warehousing  costs,  and higher levels of inventories and
accounts  receivable.  While shipping volumes improved in September and October,
strong  demand,  distribution  center  capacity  limitations  and  the  need  to
implement  process  changes  continue to result in extended order lead times and
customer service  difficulties.  The Corporation expects customer service levels
to improve through the end of 1999,  subsequent to the peak shipping period,  as
identified  process changes are  implemented,  and to be further enhanced as the
new  distribution  center  becomes  operational in 2000.  The  Corporation  will
continue to incur  increased  costs for freight and  warehousing,  for increased
working capital requirements,  for further enhancements to systems and processes
until such  improvements  are fully  implemented,  and for the  start-up  of the
Corporation's new distribution center.

The Corporation  considers its customer relations to be good. However,  customer
service    and    order    fulfillment    problems    during    the    important
Back-to-School/Halloween shipping period caused distribution difficulties in the
form of incomplete and/or delayed shipments and selective  regional/customer out
of stock conditions for the  Corporation's  products in certain  markets.  These
circumstances have resulted in lost sales and related market share declines. The
Corporation  expects to resolve these issues,  to return to historical levels of
customer service,  and to restore confidence in Hershey as a valued and reliable
supplier.  It is anticipated  that these efforts will be effective in increasing
sales and regaining market share.

The  nature of the  Corporation's  operations  and the  environment  in which it
operates  subject  it  to  changing   economic,   competitive,   regulatory  and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties.  In connection with the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the
Corporation notes that the following factors,  among others,  could cause future
results to differ materially from the forward-looking  statements,  expectations
and  assumptions  expressed  or  implied  herein.  Many of the  forward  looking
statements  contained  in  this  document  may  be  identified  by  the  use  of
forward-looking  words  such as  "believe,"  "expect,"  "anticipate,"  "should,"
"planned,"  "estimated," and "potential" among others. Factors which could cause
results to differ include,  but are not limited to: changes in the confectionery
and grocery business  environment,  including actions of competitors and changes
in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws and regulations, including
income taxes; market demand for new and existing products; raw material pricing;
the  Corporation's  ability to remedy the problems and avoid the increased costs
encountered since implementing changes to the customer service, warehousing, and
order  fulfillment  processes  and systems in July 1999;  the ability to restore
customer service to historical levels; the effects service levels have on future
customer demand; and the ability to complete construction and commence operation
of the new distribution facility on schedule.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The  potential  loss in fair value of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  and
interest rate swaps  resulting from a hypothetical  near-term  adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not  material as of October 3, 1999.  The market
risk resulting from a hypothetical  adverse market price movement of ten percent
associated  with the  estimated  average fair value of net  commodity  positions
increased  from $7.6  million as of December 31,  1998,  to $11.1  million as of
October 3, 1999.  Market risk represents 10% of the estimated average fair value
of net commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period.

                           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEMS 2 THROUGH 4 HAVE BEEN OMITTED AS NOT APPLICABLE.


ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In  January  1999,  the  Corporation  received a Notice of  Proposed  Deficiency
(Notice)  from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  related to the years 1989
through 1996. The most  significant  issue pertains to the Corporate  Owned Life
Insurance  (COLI) program which was  implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The
IRS proposed the disallowance of interest expense deductions associated with the
underlying life insurance policies.  The Corporation  believes that it has fully
complied  with the tax law as it relates to its COLI  program.  The  Corporation
filed a protest of the proposed  deficiency  with the Appeals section of the IRS
in April 1999 and intends to vigorously defend its position on this matter.

The  Corporation  has no other material  pending legal  proceedings,  other than
ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.


ITEM 5.    OTHER INFORMATION

In June 1999, the Pennsylvania  Supreme Court determined that the  manufacturing
exemption  for  Pennsylvania  Capital Stock - Franchise Tax purposes is facially
discriminatory under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution,  and
remanded for a determination  whether the tax on foreign corporations is a valid
compensatory  tax. The court further suggested that the result might be that the
entire exemption would be ruled unconstitutional. If such a ruling is eventually
sustained,  the  Corporation  may be subject to  additional  Pennsylvania  state
franchise tax liability.

In October 1999, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert $200 million of 6.7% Notes due 2005 (Notes) to variable rate
debt. The interest rate swap  agreement is cancelable at the sole  discretion of
the  counterparty  effective  April 2, 2001. At the same time,  the  Corporation

Notes at 5.8% through April 2, 2001.  Subsequently,  if the counterparty chooses
not to cancel the  agreement,  the interest  rate on the Notes would be variable
based on LIBOR until expiration on October 1, 2005.
