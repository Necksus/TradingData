        The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out
        (LIFO) method. The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
        first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. Inventories were as follows:

6.      LONG-TERM DEBT

        In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due
        2007 (6.95% Notes) under the November 1993 Form S-3 Registration
        Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion
        of the commercial paper borrowings associated with the acquisition of
        the Leaf North America confectionery operations (Leaf) in December 1996.

        In August 1997, the Corporation filed another Form S-3 Registration
        Statement under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis,
        up to $500 million of additional debt securities. Also in August 1997,
        the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due 2012 (Notes) and
        $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 (Debentures) under the November
        1993 and August 1997 Registration Statements. Proceeds from the debt
        issuance were used to repay short-term borrowings associated with the
        purchase of Common Stock from the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for
        the benefit of Milton Hershey School (Milton Hershey School Trust). As
        of April 5, 1998, $250 million of debt securities remained available for
        issuance under the August 1997 Registration Statement. As of April 5,
        1998 and December 31, 1997, $150.0 million of commercial paper
        borrowings were reclassified as long-term debt in accordance with the
        Corporation's intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a
        long-term basis.

7.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The contract amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
        equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt,
        including $150.0 million of commercial paper borrowings reclassified as
        long-term debt, approximated fair value as of April 5, 1998 and December
        31, 1997, because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments.
        The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was
        $879.2 million as of April 5, 1998, compared to a fair value of $956.0
        million, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt
        issues.
<PAGE> Page 9

        As of April 5, 1998, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
        contracts maturing in 1998 and 1999 to purchase $10.6 million in foreign
        currency, primarily British sterling and Swiss francs, and to sell $12.7
        million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen and Canadian
        dollars, at contracted forward rates. To hedge foreign currency exposure
        related to anticipated transactions associated with the purchase of
        certain raw materials and finished goods, the Corporation, from time to
        time, also purchases foreign exchange options. No options were
        outstanding as of April 5, 1998.

        The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
        obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
        necessary for maturity differences. As of April 5, 1998, the fair value
        of foreign exchange forward and options contracts approximated the
        contract value. The Corporation does not hold or issue financial
        instruments for trading purposes.

        In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
        exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
        swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate
        debt to fixed rate debt. As of April 5, 1998, the Corporation had
        agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $150.0
        million, with maturities through 1999. As of April 5, 1998, interest
        rates payable were at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.3%, and the
        interest rate receivable was floating based on the 30-day commercial
        paper composite rate which was 5.5% as of April 5, 1998. Any interest
        rate differential on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment
        to interest expense over the term of each agreement. The Corporation's
        risk related to swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such
        agreements at prevailing market rates.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER 1998 VS. FIRST QUARTER 1997


Consolidated net sales for the first quarter rose from $1,002.5 million in 1997
to $1,098.1 million in 1998, an increase of 10% from the prior year. The higher
sales primarily reflected increased sales of core confectionery brands,
incremental sales from the introduction of new confectionery products, and
increased sales of pasta and grocery products, offset somewhat by lower
international sales in the Far East.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 41.2% in 1997 to 40.6% in 1998. The
decrease reflected increased costs associated with seasonal items, higher costs
for certain major raw materials, primarily cocoa and semolina, and lower
profitability resulting from the mix of non-chocolate and chocolate
confectionery items sold in 1998 compared to sales in the first quarter of 1997.
These unfavorable variances were partially offset by improved manufacturing
efficiencies and increased profitability from the acquired Leaf brands. Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses increased by 5%, reflecting higher
marketing expenses associated with the introduction of new products.

Net interest expense in the first quarter of 1998 was $7.0 million above the
comparable period of 1997 primarily as a result of increased borrowings
associated with the purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School
Trust.

The  first  quarter  effective  income  tax rate  decreased  from  39.3% in 1997
to 39.0% in 1998  primarily  due to  changes  in the mix of the Corporation's 
income among various tax jurisdictions.

FINANCIAL CONDITION


Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper. During the first three months of 1998, the Corporation's cash and cash
equivalents increased by $5.4 million. Cash provided from operations was
sufficient to finance capital additions of $41.8 million, pay cash dividends of
$30.9 million and to repay $25.0 million of long-term debt and $17.5 million of
short-term borrowings.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.4:1 as of April 5,
1998, and 1.3:1 as of December 31, 1997. The Corporation's capitalization ratio
(total short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders' equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 58% as of April 5, 1998, and 60% as of
December 31, 1997.

As of April 5, 1998, the Corporation maintained committed credit facility
agreements with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $600 million which could
be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper. The
Corporation has options to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with the
concurrence of the banks. As of April 5, 1998, and March 30, 1997, the
Corporation also had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial
banks in the amount of approximately $25 million and $20 million, respectively.
<PAGE> Page 11

In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes under a
November 1993 Registration Statement. In August 1997, the Corporation issued
$150 million of Notes and $250 million of Debentures under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration Statements. As of April 5, 1998, $250 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration
Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250 million of debt securities
available under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate
requirements, which include reducing existing commercial paper borrowings,
financing capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.

As of April 5, 1998, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization. The Corporation anticipates
that capital expenditures will be in the range of $175 million to $200 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of continued modernization
of existing facilities and capacity expansion to support new products and line
extensions.

In late 1996, the Corporation approved a project to implement an enterprise-wide
integrated information system to replace most of the transaction systems and
applications currently supporting operations of the Corporation. Total
commitments for this system are expected to be in the range of $75 million to
$85 million. This system is Year 2000 compliant and will replace a large portion
of the Corporation's legacy information systems. Legacy systems not being
replaced by the new integrated information system are being upgraded to be Year
2000 compliant and, as of April 5, 1998, the costs are not expected to be
material to the Corporation's business, operations, or financial condition.
Progress toward compliance with Year 2000 issues by the Corporation's major
business partners is being reviewed for the most significant operations and
business activities. The extent of Year 2000 compliance efforts by major
partners and suppliers and the possible effect on the Corporation's business of
their failure to comply continues to be evaluated, but a final determination of
the potential impact cannot be made at this time. The remediation of Year 2000
issues involving the Corporation's information systems is expected to be
completed in time to prevent any material adverse consequences to the
Corporation's business, operations or financial condition.

The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and
interest rate swaps resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not material as of April 5, 1998. The market
risk resulting from a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent
associated with the estimated average fair value of net commodity positions
declined from $9.6 million as of December 31, 1997, to $7.3 million as of April
5, 1998. Market risk represents 10% of the estimated average fair value of net
commodity positions at four dates prior to the end of each period. The decrease
in average market risk was primarily related to changes in the excess of futures
contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts in 1998 compared to
1997.
