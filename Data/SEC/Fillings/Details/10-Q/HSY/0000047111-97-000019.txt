                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION

        The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the
        accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of
        intercompany accounts and transactions. These statements have been
        prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not
        include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
        accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the
        opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal
        recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
        been included. Operating results for the three months ended March 30,
        1997, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
        for the year ending December 31, 1997. For more information, refer to
        the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the
        Corporation's 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

3.      STOCK SPLIT

        In August 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors declared a
        two-for-one split of the Common Stock and Class B Common Stock effective
        September 13, 1996, to stockholders of record August 23, 1996. The split
        was effected as a stock dividend by distributing one additional share
        for each share held. Unless otherwise indicated, all shares and per
        share information have been restated to reflect the stock split.

4.      NET INCOME PER SHARE

        Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average number
        of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock outstanding
        during each period. A total of 143,849 shares of Common Stock was
        repurchased during the first quarter of 1997 under the share repurchase
        program begun in 1996. A total of 27,153,165 shares were held as
        Treasury Stock as of March 30, 1997.

5.      INVENTORIES

        The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out
        (LIFO) method. The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
        first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. Inventories were as follows:

6.      ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

        In January 1996, the Corporation completed the sale of the assets of
        Hershey Canada Inc.'s PLANTERS nut and LIFE SAVERS and BREATH SAVERS
        hard candy, and BEECH-NUT cough drops businesses to Johnvince Foods
        group and Beta Brands Inc., respectively.

        In December 1996, the Corporation acquired from an affiliate of
        Huhtamaki Oy (Huhtamaki), Huhtamaki's Leaf North America (Leaf)
        confectionery operations and sold to Huhtamaki the outstanding shares of
        Gubor Holding GmbH (Gubor) and Sperlari, S.r.l. (Sperlari). For further
        information, refer to the Corporation's 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

7.      LONG-TERM DEBT

        In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due
        2007 (Notes) under the November 1993 Form S-3 Registration Statement.
        Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of the
        commercial paper borrowings associated with the Leaf acquisition. As of
        March 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996, $150.0 million and $300.0 million,
        respectively, of commercial paper borrowings were reclassified as
        long-term debt in accordance with the Corporation's intent and ability
        to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis.

8.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
        equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
        approximated fair value as of March 30, 1997, because of the relatively
        short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term
        debt, including the current portion, also approximated fair value as of
        March 30, 1997, based upon quoted market prices, as of those dates, for
        the same or similar debt issues.

        As of March 30, 1997, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
        contracts maturing in 1997 and 1998 to purchase $21.6 million in foreign
        currency, primarily British sterling, German marks and Swiss francs, and
        to sell $25.4 million in foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars
        and Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.

        The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
        obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
        necessary for maturity differences. As of March 30, 1997, the fair value
        of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated carrying value. The
        Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
        purposes.

        In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
        exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
        swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate
        debt to fixed rate debt. As of March 30, 1997 and March 31, 1996, the
        Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount
        of $250.0 million and $200.0 million with maturities through 1999 and
        1997, respectively. As of March 30, 1997 and March 31, 1996, interest
        rates payable were at weighted average fixed rates of 6.1% and 5.6%,
        respectively, and interest rates receivable were floating based on
        30-day commercial paper composite rates. Any interest rate differential
        on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment to interest
        expense during the period. The Corporation's risk related to swap
        agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at
        current market rates.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations - First Quarter 1997 vs. First Quarter 1996
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the first quarter rose from $931.5 million in 1996 to
$1,002.5 million in 1997, an increase of 8% from the prior year. The higher
sales primarily reflected incremental sales from the Leaf acquisition and from
the introduction of new confectionery products. These increases were offset
somewhat by lower sales resulting from the divestitures of the Gubor and
Sperlari businesses in December 1996 and a decline in sales of pasta and grocery
products.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 41.0% in 1996 to 41.2% in 1997. The
increase reflected the impact of confectionery selling price increases, improved
manufacturing efficiencies and the favorable impact of the divestitures of the
Gubor and Sperlari businesses. These favorable variances were partially offset
by the lower margin associated with the recently acquired Leaf business and
increases in manufacturing costs. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses
increased by 5%, due to increased marketing expenses associated with the
introduction of new products.

Net interest expense in the first quarter of 1997 was $3.5 million above the
comparable period of 1996 primarily as a result of increased borrowings 
associated with the Leaf acquisition.

The first quarter effective income tax rate decreased from 40.1% in 1996 to
39.3% in 1997 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of the
Corporation's income.

Financial Condition
- -------------------

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper. During the first three months of 1997, the Corporation's cash and cash
equivalents increased by $15.9 million. Cash provided from operations and
long-term borrowings was sufficient to repay $173.3 million of short-term
borrowings, finance capital additions of $38.0 million and pay cash dividends of
$30.0 million.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.2:1 as of March 30,
1997 and December 31, 1996. The Corporation's capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders' equity, short-term
and long-term debt) was 44% as of March 30, 1997, and 46% as of December 31,
1996.

As of March 30, 1997, the Corporation could borrow up to $600 million under its
committed credit facility agreements with options to increase borrowings by $1.0
billion. As of March 30, 1997, and March 31, 1996, the Corporation also had
lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks in the amount
of approximately $20 million and $100 million, respectively, which could be
borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper.



<PAGE>


In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of Notes under a November
1993 Registration Statement. As of March 30, 1997, $150 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the Registration Statement.
Proceeds from any offering of the $150 million of debt securities available
under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate requirements
including, reducing existing commercial paper borrowings, financing capital
additions, and funding future business acquisitions and working capital
requirements.

As of March 30, 1997, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization. The Corporation anticipates
that capital expenditures will be in the range of $175 million to $225 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of continued modernization
of existing facilities and capacity expansion to support new products and line
extensions.

Recent Pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per share (FAS 128). FAS 128 specifies
the computation, presentation, and disclosure requirements for earnings per
share and is effective for periods ending after December 15, 1997. Adoption of
this accounting standard is not expected to have a material effect on the
earnings per share computations of the Corporation.
