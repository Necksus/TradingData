                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION

        The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the
        accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of
        intercompany accounts and transactions. These statements have been
        prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not
        include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
        accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the
        opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal
        recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
        been included. Operating results for the three months and year-to-date
        period ended June 29, 1997, are not necessarily indicative of the
        results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 1997. For
        more information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and
        footnotes included in the Corporation's 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

3.      STOCK SPLIT

        In August 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors declared a
        two-for-one split of the Common Stock and Class B Common Stock effective
        September 13, 1996, to stockholders of record August 23, 1996. The split
        was effected as a stock dividend by distributing one additional share
        for each share held. Unless otherwise indicated, all shares and per
        share information have been restated to reflect the stock split.

4.      NET INCOME PER SHARE

        Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average number
        of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock outstanding
        during each period. A total of 171,510 shares of Common Stock was
        repurchased during the first six months of 1997 under the share
        repurchase program begun in 1996. A total of 27,180,826 shares were held
        as Treasury Stock as of June 29, 1997.

5.      INVENTORIES

        (LIFO) method. The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
        first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. Inventories were as follows:

6.      ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

        In January 1996, the Corporation completed the sale of the assets of
        Hershey Canada Inc.'s PLANTERS nut and LIFE SAVERS and BREATH SAVERS
        hard candy, and BEECH-NUT cough drops businesses to Johnvince Foods
        group and Beta Brands Inc., respectively.

        In December 1996, the Corporation acquired from an affiliate of
        Huhtamaki Oy (Huhtamaki), Huhtamaki's Leaf North America (Leaf)
        confectionery operations and sold to Huhtamaki the outstanding shares of
        Gubor Holding GmbH (Gubor) and Sperlari, S.r.l. (Sperlari). For further
        information, refer to the Corporation's 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

7.      LONG-TERM DEBT

        In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due
        2007 (Notes) under the November 1993 Form S-3 Registration Statement.
        Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of the
        commercial paper borrowings associated with the Leaf acquisition. As of
        June 29, 1997 and December 31, 1996, $150.0 million and $300.0 million,
        respectively, of commercial paper borrowings were reclassified as
        long-term debt in accordance with the Corporation's intent and ability
        to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis.

8.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
        equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
        approximated fair value as of June 29, 1997, because of the relatively
        short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term
        debt, including the current portion, also approximated fair value as of
        June 29, 1997, based upon quoted market prices, as of those dates, for
        the same or similar debt issues.

        As of June 29, 1997, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
        contracts maturing in 1997 and 1998 to purchase $18.5 million in foreign
        currency, primarily British sterling, Swiss francs and German marks, and
        to sell $20.9 million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen and
        Canadian dollars, at contracted forward rates.

        The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
        obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
        necessary for maturity differences. As of June 29, 1997, the fair value
        of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated carrying value. The
        Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
        purposes.

        In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
        exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
        swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate
        debt to fixed rate debt. As of June 29, 1997 and June 30, 1996, the
        Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount
        of $250.0 million and $200.0 million with maturities through 1999 and
        1997, respectively. As of June 29, 1997 and June 30, 1996, interest
        rates payable were at weighted average fixed rates of 6.1% and 5.6%,
        respectively, and interest rates receivable were floating based on
        30-day commercial paper composite rates. Any interest rate differential
        on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment to interest
        expense during the period. The Corporation's risk related to swap
        agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at
        current market rates.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SECOND QUARTER 1997 VS. SECOND QUARTER 1996
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the second quarter rose from $796.3 million in 1996
to $905.7 million in 1997, an increase of 14% from the prior year. The higher
sales primarily reflected incremental sales from the Leaf acquisition, increased
sales of existing domestic confectionery brands and the introduction of new
confectionery products. These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales
resulting from the divestitures of the Gubor and Sperlari businesses in December
1996.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 41.0% in 1996 to 41.4% in 1997. The
increase reflected lower costs for certain major raw materials, particularly
flour and milk, and increased manufacturing efficiencies. These favorable
effects were partially offset by the lower margin associated with the Leaf
business. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased by 12%, as a
result of incremental expenses associated with the acquired Leaf operations and
increased marketing expenses associated with the introduction of new products.
These higher expenses were offset somewhat by decreases related to the
divestiture of Gubor and Sperlari.

Net interest expense in the second quarter of 1997 was $4.9 million above the
comparable period of 1996 primarily as a result of increased borrowings
associated with the Leaf acquisition.

The second quarter effective income tax rate decreased from 40.1% in 1996 to
39.3% in 1997 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of the
Corporation's income.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST SIX MONTHS 1997 VS. FIRST SIX MONTHS 1996
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated net sales for the first six months of 1997 increased by $180.3
million or 10% primarily as a result of the incremental sales from the Leaf
acquisition, the introduction of new confectionery products and increased sales
of core confectionery items. These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales
resulting from the divestiture of the Gubor and Sperlari businesses and a
decline in sales of pasta and grocery products.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 41.0% in 1996 to 41.3% in 1997. The
increase was primarily the result of lower costs for certain major raw
materials, primarily flour and milk. The impact of raw material cost decreases
was partially offset by the lower margin associated with the Leaf business.
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased by 8%, as a result of
incremental expenses associated with the Leaf business and increased marketing
expenses associated with the introduction of new products, partially offset by
decreases resulting from the Gubor and Sperlari divestitures.

Net interest expense was $8.4 million above prior year, primarily as a result of
increased borrowings associated with the Leaf acquisition and higher short-term
borrowing rates.

The effective income tax rate decreased from 40.1% in 1996 to 39.3% in 1997
primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of the Corporation's income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which
typically peak during the summer, generally have been met by issuing commercial
paper. During the first six months of 1997, the Corporation's cash and cash
equivalents decreased by $35.0 million. Cash and cash equivalents on hand at the
beginning of the period and cash provided from operations and long-term
borrowings was sufficient to repay $154.4 million of short-term borrowings,
finance capital additions of $85.4 million and pay cash dividends of $59.9
million.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.2:1 as of June 29, 1997
and December 31, 1996. The Corporation's capitalization ratio (total short-term
and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders' equity, short-term and
long-term debt) was 44% as of June 29, 1997, and 46% as of December 31, 1996.

As of June 29, 1997, the Corporation maintained committed credit facility 
agreements with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $600 million which could 
be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper.  The 
Corporation has options to increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with the
concurrence of the banks. As of June 29, 1997, and June 30, 1996, the 
Corporation also had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial
banks in the amount of approximately $20 million and $100 million, respectively.

In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of Notes under a November
1993 Registration Statement. As of June 29, 1997, $150 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the Registration Statement.
Proceeds from any offering of the $150 million of debt securities available
under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate requirements
including, reducing existing commercial paper borrowings, financing capital
additions, and funding future business acquisitions and working capital
requirements.

As of June 29, 1997, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included
manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization. The Corporation anticipates
that capital expenditures will be in the range of $175 million to $225 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of continued modernization
of existing facilities and capacity expansion to support new products and line
extensions.

RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per share (FAS 128). FAS 128
specifies the computation, presentation, and disclosure requirements for
earnings per share and is effective for periods ending after December 15, 1997.
Adoption of this accounting standard is not expected to have a material effect
on the earnings per share computations of the Corporation.
