NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial
     statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its
     subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
     transactions.  These statements reflect all adjustments which are,
     in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
     the information contained herein.  All such adjustments were of a
     normal and recurring nature.  Certain reclassifications have been
     made to prior year amounts to conform to the 1995 presentations.

2.   Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

                                          For the Three Months Ended
                                      March 31, 1996      April 2, 1995
                                                                       
                                         (in thousands of dollars)

     Interest expense                    $13,871            $10,184      
     Interest income                        (892)              (746)     
     Capitalized interest                   (755)              (294)     
                                                                    
        Interest expense, net            $12,224            $ 9,144      
                                                                    

3.   Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average
     number of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
     outstanding during the period.  Average shares outstanding during the
     first quarter were 77,313,574 in 1996 and 86,728,387 in 1995.  There
     were no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding during the periods
     presented.

     A total of 3,956,930 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased
     under a share repurchase program begun in 1993, thereby completing
     the $200 million program as of March 31, 1996.  Of the total shares
     repurchased, 264,000 shares were retired, 32,775 shares were reissued
     in connection with the exercise of stock options and 3,660,155 shares
     were held as Treasury Stock as of March 31, 1996.  In addition, in
     August 1995, the Corporation purchased 9,049,773 shares of its Common
     Stock from Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of
     Milton Hershey School.  A total of 12,709,928 shares were held as
     Treasury Stock as of March 31, 1996.

     In February 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved an
     additional share repurchase program to acquire from time to time,
     through open market or privately negotiated transactions, up to $200
     million of Common Stock.  The repurchase of shares under this program
     began in April 1996.

     (LIFO) method.  The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
     first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.  Inventories were as

 5.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax
     restructuring charge of $106.1 million following a comprehensive
     review of domestic and international operations designed to enhance
     performance of operating assets by lowering operating and
     administrative costs, eliminating underperforming assets and
     streamlining the overall decision-making process.

     As of March 31, 1996, $85.1 million of restructuring reserves had
     been utilized and $16.7 million had been reversed to reflect
     revisions and changes in estimates to the original restructuring
     program.  Remaining accrued restructuring reserves will be utilized
     during 1996 as the final aspects of the restructuring program are
     completed.  Operating cash flows were used to fund cash requirements
     which represented approximately 25% of the total reserves utilized. 
     The non-cash portion of restructuring reserve utilization was
     associated primarily with the divestiture of foreign businesses and
     the discontinuation of certain product lines.

 6.  In June 1995, the Corporation completed the sale of the outstanding
     shares of Overspecht B.V. (OZF Jamin) to a management buyout group
     at OZF Jamin, as part of the restructuring program announced by the
     Corporation in late 1994.  The Corporation purchased the outstanding
     shares of OZF Jamin in October 1993 for approximately $20.2 million.

 7.  In January 1996, the Corporation completed the sale of the assets of
     Hershey Canada, Inc.'s PLANTERS nut (Planters) and LIFE SAVERS and
     BREATH SAVERS hard candy, and BEECH-NUT cough drop (Life Savers)
     businesses to Johnvince Foods Group and Beta Brands Inc.,
     respectively.  Both transactions were part of the Corporation's
     restructuring program.

 8.  In December 1995, the Corporation completed the acquisition of the
     outstanding shares of the confectionery company Henry Heide,
     Incorporated (Henry Heide), for approximately $12.5 million.  Henry
     Heide's manufacturing facility is located in New Brunswick, N.J.,
     where it manufactures a variety of non-chocolate confectionery
     products including JUJYFRUITS candies and WUNDERBEANS jellybeans.

     The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and,
     accordingly, results subsequent to the date of acquisition are
     included in the consolidated financial statements.  Had the results
     of the Henry Heide acquisition been included in consolidated results
     for the full corresponding three-month period of 1995, the effect
     would not have been material.

 9.  In October 1995, the Corporation issued $200 million of 6.7% Notes
     due 2005 (Notes) under Form S-3 Registration Statements which were
     declared effective in June 1990 and November 1993.  The proceeds from
     issuance of the Notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings. 

10.  The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
     equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term
     debt approximated fair value as of March 31, 1996 and December 31,
     1995, because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. 
     The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion,
     also approximated fair value as of March 31, 1996 and December 31,
     1995, based upon quoted market prices, as of those dates, for the
     same or similar debt issues.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 7
     
     As of March 31, 1996, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
     contracts maturing in 1996 and 1997 to purchase $24.0 million in
     foreign currency, primarily British sterling, German marks, and Irish
     punt, and to sell $13.5 million in foreign currency, primarily
     Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.

     As of December 31, 1995, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
     contracts maturing in 1996 and 1997 to purchase $54.7 million in
     foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars, British sterling and
     Swiss francs, and to sell $26.4 million in foreign currency,
     primarily Italian lira, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at
     contracted forward rates.  Additionally, as of December 31, 1995, the
     Corporation had purchased foreign exchange options of $11.5 million
     and written foreign exchange options of $8.9 million, principally
     related to British sterling.  Such options expired or were settled
     in the first quarter of 1996.

     The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
     obtaining  quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted
     where necessary for maturity differences, and the fair value of
     foreign exchange options is estimated using active market quotations. 
     As of March 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, the fair value of foreign
     exchange forward and options contracts approximated carrying value. 
     The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for
     trading purposes.

     In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
     exposure, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements
     in the fourth quarter of 1995 to effectively convert a portion of its
     floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.  As of March 31, 1996, the
     Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional
     amount of $200.0 million with maturities through 1997.  As of March
     31, 1996, interest rates payable were at a weighted average fixed
     rate of 5.6% and interest rates receivable were floating based on 30-
     day commercial paper composite rates.  Any interest rate differential
     on interest rate swaps is recognized as an adjustment to interest
     expense over the term of the agreement.  The Corporation's risk
     related to swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such
     agreements at current market rates.

     for more detailed financial statements and footnotes.

               Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - First Quarter 1996 vs. First Quarter 1995

Consolidated net sales for the first quarter rose from $867.4
million in 1995 to $931.3 million in 1996, an increase of 7% from
the prior year.  The higher sales primarily reflected sales volume
increases for existing confectionery and grocery brands,
incremental sales from new domestic confectionery and grocery
products, confectionery selling price increases in the United
States and incremental sales from the acquisition of Henry Heide. 
These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales resulting from
the divestitures of OZF Jamin in the second quarter of 1995 and the
Planters and Life Savers businesses in January 1996.

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 42.0% in 1995 to 41.0%
in 1996.  The decrease was primarily the result of higher costs for
certain major raw materials and increased manufacturing costs
primarily attributable to production start-up and manufacturing of
new products, along with adverse weather conditions.  These cost
increases were partially offset by confectionery price increases
and the favorable impact of the OZF Jamin divestiture.  Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses increased by 7%, due to
increased advertising and promotion expenses reflecting sales
volume increases and activities related to the anticipated
introduction of new products.

Net interest expense in the first quarter of 1996 was $3.1 million
above the comparable period of 1995 primarily as a result of higher
fixed interest expense.  The increase in fixed interest was due to
the issuance of $200 million of 6.7% Notes due 2005 (Notes) in
October 1995.  The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were
used to reduce short-term borrowings required to fund capital
additions, payment of cash dividends, share repurchases and working
capital requirements. 

The first quarter effective income tax rate decreased from 40.2% in
1995 to 40.1% in 1996.

Financial Condition

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
cash generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital
needs, which typically peak during the summer, generally have been
met by issuing commercial paper.  During the first three months of
1996, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents increased by
$27.6 million.  Cash provided from operations was sufficient to
finance capital additions of $36.0 million, pay cash dividends of
$27.3 million and reduce short-term borrowings by $42.2 million. 
The increase in cash provided from operations primarily reflected
favorable changes in working capital balances.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 as of
March 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995.  The Corporation's
capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a
percent of stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was
40% as of March 31, 1996, and 42% as of December 31, 1995.  As of
April 2, 1995 the Corporation had lines of credit with domestic and
international commercial banks in the amount of approximately $525
million which could be borrowed directly or used to support the
<PAGE>
<PAGE>Page 9

issuance of commercial paper.

In December 1995, the Corporation entered into committed credit
facility agreements with a syndicate of banks under which it could
borrow up to $600 million as of March 31, 1996, with options to
increase borrowings by $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the
banks.  Of the total committed credit facility, $200 million is for
a renewable 364-day term and $400 million is effective for a five-
year term.  The credit facilities may be used to fund general
corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and,
in certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions.  As
of March 31, 1996, the Corporation also had lines of credit with
domestic and international commercial banks in the amount of
approximately $100 million which could be borrowed directly or used
to support the issuance of commercial paper.

In October 1995, The Corporation issued $200 million of Notes under
Form S-3 Registration Statements which were declared effective in
June 1990 and November 1993.  As of March 31, 1996, $300 million of
debt securities remained available for issuance under the November
1993 Registration Statement.  Proceeds from any offering of the
$300 million of debt securities available under the shelf
registration may be used for general corporate requirements
including, reducing existing commercial paper borrowings, financing
capital additions, and funding future business acquisitions and
working capital requirements.

In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Corporation entered into
interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of
its floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.  As of March 31, 1996,
the Corporation had agreements outstanding with an aggregate
notional amount of $200.0 million, with maturities through 1997. 
Any interest rate differential on interest rate swaps is recognized
as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the
agreement.

As of March 31, 1996, the Corporation's principal capital
commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion and
modernization.  The Corporation anticipates that capital
expenditures will be in the range of $125 million to $175 million
per annum during the next several years as a result of continued
modernization of existing facilities and capacity expansion to
support new products and line extensions.
