NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements
       include the accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after
       elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.  These statements
       reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,
       necessary for a fair presentation of the information contained herein. 
       All such adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

2.  Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

                                            For the Six Months Ended
                                        July 2, 1995         July 3, 1994
                                            (in thousands of dollars)

          Interest expense, net            $16,993            $16,029      
                                                                   
3.  Income per share has been computed based on the weighted average number
    of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock outstanding
    during the period.  Average shares outstanding during the second quarter
    and six months ended July 2, 1995 were 86,637,997 and 86,683,439,
    respectively, and were 87,095,985 and 87,256,569 for the respective
    periods in 1994.  There were no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding
    during the periods presented.

    A total of 3,704,330 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased under
    a share repurchase program of which 3,440,330 shares were held as
    Treasury Stock as of July 2, 1995.

4.  The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in, first-out
    (LIFO) method.  The remaining inventories are stated at the lower of
    first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.  Inventories were as follows:

                                          July 2, 1995     December 31, 1994

          Total inventories                 $577,929           $445,702 
                                                                       
5. Restructuring Charge

       In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax
       restructuring charge of $106.1 million following a comprehensive review
       of domestic and international operations designed to enhance performance
       of operating assets by lowering operating and administrative costs,
       eliminating underperforming assets and streamlining the overall
       decision-making process.  The charge of $106.1 million resulted in an
       after-tax charge of $80.2 million or $.92 per share in 1994.
<PAGE>

       The restructuring charge and its subsequent utilization are summarized
       below by category (in thousands of dollars):

       Consolidation of operations
        and disposal of machinery                                              
        and equipment              15,203     (3,992)       (2,845)      8,366 
       
       Total                     $106,105   $(24,050)     $(30,126)    $51,929 


    In June 1995, the Corporation completed the sale of Overspecht B.V.
    (OZF/Jamin) to a management buyout group at OZF/Jamin. During the first 
    half of 1995, non-cash charges to accrued restructuring reserves were 
    $18.9 million, related primarily to the divestiture of OZF/Jamin.  
    Operating cash flows will be used to fund any severance or other 
    cash items.

    The Corporation anticipates that the remaining reserve is adequate to
    cover the cost of restructuring activities to be completed during 1995.
    Any deficiencies in particular reserve categories will be offset as
    requirements in other categories are finalized.
    
 6. Financial Instruments

    The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
    approximated fair value as of July 2, 1995 because of the relatively
    short maturity of these instruments.  The carrying value of long-term
    debt, including the current portion, approximated fair value as of July
    2, 1995, based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt
    issues.

    As of July 2, 1995, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
    contracts maturing primarily in 1995 and 1996 to purchase $14.4 million
    in foreign currency, principally British sterling and Irish punt, and to
    sell $15.9 million in foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars and
    Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.  Additionally, the
    Corporation had purchased foreign exchange options of $11.6 million and
    written foreign exchange options of $10.9 million, principally related
    to British sterling.  As of July 2, 1995, the fair value of foreign
    exchange forward and options contracts approximated carrying value.  The
    Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
    purposes.

    for more detailed financial statements and footnotes.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 8    Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - Second Quarter 1995 vs. Second Quarter 1994

Consolidated net sales for the second quarter rose from $676.0
million in 1994 to $722.3 million in 1995, an increase of 7%.  The
higher sales primarily reflected volume growth from existing
domestic confectionery brands and pasta products and selling price
increases in several of the Corporation's foreign businesses. 
These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales resulting from
the discontinuance of the Corporation's refrigerated pudding line
in late 1994 and the divestiture of OZF/Jamin in May 1995.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 40.4% in 1994 to 41.3%
in 1995.  The increase was primarily the result of manufacturing
efficiency improvements and selling price increases, partially
offset by higher costs for certain major raw materials.  Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses increased by 6%, due to
increased advertising for existing confectionery brands and higher
levels of promotion expense primarily related to the sales volume
increase.  These increases were partially offset by lower
administrative expenses.

Net interest expense in the second quarter of 1995 was $.7 million
below the comparable period of 1994 due to lower fixed interest
expense and higher interest income.  The decrease in fixed interest
expense reflected reduced long-term borrowings, while increased
interest income resulted from higher investment rates and balances.

The second quarter effective income tax rate decreased from 39.8%
in 1994 to 39.3% in 1995.  The lower rate in 1995 was due primarily
to the impact of changes in Pennsylvania state tax regulations
which included a June 1995 reduction in the state income tax rate
which was retroactive to January 1, 1995.

Results of Operations - Second Six Months 1995 vs. Second Six
Months 1994

Consolidated net sales for the first six months of 1995 increased
by $29.8 million or 2% as a result of incremental sales from new
confectionery and grocery products, pasta sales volume increases,
the introduction of confectionery brands in new international
markets and selected selling price increases.  These increases were
partially offset by lower sales resulting from the discontinuance
of the Corporation's refrigerated pudding line in late 1994 and the
divestiture of OZF/Jamin in May 1995.

The consolidated gross margin increased from 40.4% in 1994 to 41.7%
in 1995.  The increase was primarily the result of manufacturing
efficiency improvements and selling price increases, partially
offset by higher costs for certain major raw materials.  Selling,
marketing and administrative expenses increased by 1% due to
increased advertising for existing confectionery brands, partly
offset by lower administrative expenses.

Net interest expense was $1.0 million above prior year as higher
short-term interest expense and reduced capitalized interest were
only partially offset by lower fixed interest expense and higher
interest income.  Short-term interest expense was above prior year
primarily as a result of higher borrowing rates, partially offset
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 9
by lower borrowing balances.  Capitalized interest was below prior
year reflecting lower levels of spending on projects qualifying for
interest capitalization.  Fixed interest expense was less than
prior year due to reduced long-term borrowings, while investment
income exceeded prior year as a result of an increase in average
investment income rates and higher investment balances.

The effective income tax rate increased from 39.8% in 1994 to 39.9%
in 1995.  The higher rate in 1995 was due primarily to changes in
the mix of the Corporation's income among various tax jurisdictions
which more than offset lower Pennsylvania state income taxes
resulting from changes in tax regulations enacted in June 1995.

Financial Condition

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
cash generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital
needs, which typically peak during the summer, generally have been
met by issuing commercial paper.  During the first six months of
1995, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents increased by $5.2
million.  Cash provided from operations and short-term borrowings
was sufficient to finance capital additions of $66.6 million, pay
cash dividends of $55.5 million, repay long-term debt of $5.8
million and fund share repurchases of $12.9 million.  The increase
in cash generated from operations primarily reflected increases in
cash provided from changes in accounts receivable and inventory
balances, the timing of income tax payments and higher income in
1995 versus 1994.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.3:1 and
1.2:1 as of July 2, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively.  The
Corporation's capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term
debt as a percent of stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term
debt) was 26% as of July 2, 1995, and 25% as of December 31, 1994. 
As of July 2, 1995 the Corporation had lines of credit with
domestic and international commercial banks in the amount of
approximately $470 million which could be borrowed directly or used
to support the issuance of commercial paper.

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $106.1 million ($80.2 million after-tax or
$.92 per share).  The restructuring program is expected to be
completed in 1995 and result in annual savings of approximately
$18.0 million starting in 1996.

As of July 2, 1995, $100 million of debt securities remained
available for issuance under a Form S-3 Registration Statement
which was declared effective in June 1990 and an additional $400
million of debt securities under a Form S-3 Registration Statement
declared effective in November 1993.  Proceeds from any offering of
the $500 million of debt securities available under these shelf
registrations may be used to reduce existing commercial paper
borrowings, finance capital additions, and fund a share repurchase
program and future business acquisitions.

As of July 2, 1995, the Corporation's principal capital commitments
included manufacturing capacity expansion and modernization.  The
Corporation anticipates that capital expenditures will be in the
range of $125 million to $175 million per annum during the next
<PAGE>
<PAGE> Page 10
several years as a result of continued modernization of existing
facilities and capacity expansion to support new products and line
extensions.

A total of 3,704,330 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased
for approximately $184.4 million under a share repurchase program. 
As of July 2, 1995, 3,440,330 shares were held as Treasury Stock.

                         ARTICLE I - STOCKHOLDERS


      Section 1.  Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of
stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such
date, time and place, either within or without the State of
Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of
Directors from time to time.  Any other proper business may be
transacted at the annual meeting.

      Section 2.  Special Meetings.  A special meeting of the
stockholders may be called by the Board of Directors, the
Executive Committee of the Board of Directors or by stockholders
holding in the aggregate at least twenty-five percent of the
outstanding votes entitled to be cast by holders of the Common
Stock and the Class B Common Stock voting together without regard
to class on the date such meeting is called.

      Section 3.  Place of Meetings.  All meetings of the
stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the
State of Delaware, as may from time to time be fixed by the Board
of Directors, or as shall be specified or fixed in the respective
notices or waivers of notice thereof.

      Section 4.  Notice of Meetings.  Notice of each meeting
of the stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given
not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date on
which the meeting is to be held to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote, by delivering a written or printed notice
thereof to him, personally, or by mailing such notice in a
postage prepaid envelope addressed to him at his post office
address registered with the Corporation.  No publication of any
notice of a meeting of stockholders shall be required.  Every
notice of a special meeting of stockholders, besides stating the
time and place of the meeting, shall state briefly the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called.

      Section 5.  Waiver of Notice.  Regardless of any other
provision herein, notice of any meeting of stockholders shall not
be required as to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting
in person or by proxy; and, if any stockholder shall, in person
or by proxy duly authorized, waive notice of any meeting, whether
before or after such meeting, notice thereof shall not be
required as to him.

<PAGE>
      
      Section 6.  Quorum and Required Vote.  At any meeting
of stockholders at which any action is to be taken or questions
decided (including the election of directors), the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast at the meeting with respect to such action or
question shall constitute a quorum, provided, however, that at
such time as shares of the Class B Common Stock become
outstanding, with respect to the taking of any action or the
deciding of any question as to which either the Common Stock or
the Class B Common Stock is entitled to vote separately as a
class pursuant to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to
be cast by such class voting separately as a class at such
meeting shall constitute a quorum.  At every such meeting at
which a quorum is present for the taking of any action or the
deciding of any question, a majority of the votes present or
represented shall be necessary to take such action or decide such
question, with the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
voting together without regard to class or separately as a class
or classes as may be prescribed by the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, provided, however, that with
respect to the election of directors pursuant to the provisions
of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws,
the persons receiving the greatest number of votes, in descending
order, shall be elected for the positions to be filled.  The
absence of a quorum as provided for herein for the taking of any
one action or the deciding of any one question shall not prevent
the taking of any other action or the deciding of any other
question for which a quorum is present.

      Section 7.  Inspectors of Election.  The Corporation
shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or
more inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a
written report thereof.  The Corporation may designate one or
more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who
fails to act.  In the event that no inspector so appointed or
designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting.  Each inspector, before
entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and
sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability.  The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated
shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share,
(ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation
represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and
ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and
retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any
challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) 



                                    -2-
<PAGE>
certify their determination of the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such
inspectors' count of all votes and ballots.  Such certification
shall specify such other information as may be required by law. 
In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots
cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the
inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law.  No person who is a candidate for an office at an
election may serve as an inspector at such election.

      Section 8.  Conduct of Meetings.  The date and time of
the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which
the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at
such meeting by the person presiding over the meeting.  The Board
of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such
rules, regulations or procedures for the conduct of meetings of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.  Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules, regulations or procedures as
adopted by the Board of Directors, the chair of any meeting of
stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such
rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in
the judgment of such chair, are appropriate for the proper
conduct of the meeting.  Such rules, regulations or procedures,
whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the
following:  (1) the establishment of an agenda or order of
business for the meeting; (2) rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present;
(3) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting
to the stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly
authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
chair shall permit; (4) restrictions on entry to the meeting
after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (5)
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants.  Unless, and to the extent determined by the Board
of Directors or the chair of the meeting, meetings of
stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
rules of parliamentary procedure.

      Section 9.  Notice of Stockholder Business.  At an
annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. 
To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be
(a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors,
(b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or by a stockholder or
stockholders holding, in the aggregate, at least twenty-five
percent (25%) of the outstanding votes entitled to be cast by
holders of the Common Stock and Class B Common Stock voting
together without regard to class, or (c) otherwise properly 


                                    -3-
<PAGE>
requested to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder.  For
business to be properly requested to be brought before an annual
meeting by a stockholder pursuant to (c) above, the stockholder
must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary
of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days prior to
the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date
of the meeting is not publicly announced by the Corporation by
mail, press release or otherwise more than sixty (60) days prior
to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the
close of business on the fifteenth (15th) day following the day
on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was mailed
to stockholders.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall
set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring
before the annual meeting:  (a) a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the
reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b)
the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books,
of the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and
number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned
by the stockholder, and (d) any material interest of the
stockholder in such business.  Notwithstanding anything in the
By-laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an
annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Section 9, Article I of these By-laws.  The chair of an
annual meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9 of these By-laws, and if he or she should so determine,
he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business
not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.


                            ARTICLE II - STOCK

      Section 1.  Stock Certificates.  Every stockholder
shall be entitled to a certificate signed by or having engraved
thereon a facsimile signature of the Chief Executive Officer and
the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary, certifying the number and class of the
Corporation's shares held by such stockholder.

      Section 2.  Transfer Agents and Registrars.  The Board
of Directors may, in its discretion, appoint responsible banks or
trust companies to act as Transfer Agents and Registrars of the
stock of the Corporation; and, upon such appointments being made,
no stock certificate shall be valid until countersigned by one of
such Transfer Agents and registered by one of such Registrars. 
Where any such certificate is registered with the manual


                                    -4-
<PAGE>
signature of a Registrar, the countersignature of a Transfer
Agent may be a facsimile or engraved, stamped or printed.

      Section 3.  Transfer of Stock.  Shares of stock may be
transferred by delivery of the certificates therefor, accompanied
either by an assignment in writing on the back of the
certificates or by written power of attorney to sell, assign and
transfer the same, signed by the record holder thereof; but no
transfer shall affect the right of the Corporation to pay any
dividend upon the stock to the holder of record thereof, or to
treat the holder of record as the holder in fact thereof for all
purposes, and no transfer shall be valid, except between the
parties thereto, until such transfer shall have been made upon
the books of the Corporation.  

      Section 4.  Lost Certificates.  In case any certificate
of stock shall be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Board of
Directors, in its discretion, may authorize the issue of, or
provide for the manner of issuing, a substitute certificate in
place of the certificate so lost, stolen or destroyed; provided,
that, in each such case, the applicant for a substitute
certificate shall furnish to the Corporation and to such of its
Transfer Agents and Registrars as may require the same evidence
to their satisfaction, in their discretion, of the loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate and of the ownership thereof, and
also such security or indemnity as may be required by them.

      Section 5.  Record Date.  The Board of Directors may
fix a record date for the purpose of determining the stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof; to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock;
or for the purpose of any other lawful action.  The record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and the record
date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of
such meeting or such action, or, with respect to any such
meeting, less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. 
Only stockholders of record on the record date shall be entitled
to notice of and to vote at such meeting, or to receive such
dividends or rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may
be.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 
The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the purpose of
determining the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date


                                    -5-
<PAGE>
is adopted by the Board of Directors, and shall not be more than
ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.

      Section 6.  Dividends.  The Board of Directors may
declare and pay such dividends upon the shares of the
Corporation's capital stock out of the surplus or the net profits
of the Corporation as it may deem expedient and as the condition
of the Corporation shall warrant.


                     ARTICLE III - BOARD OF DIRECTORS

meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of a person not
made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

      Section 3.  Organization Meeting.  The Board of
Directors shall meet as soon as practicable after the annual
election of directors for the purpose of organization and the
transaction of other business.  No notice of such meeting shall

consent and waiver of notice thereof, signed by all the
directors.

      Section 4.  Stated Meetings.  The Board of Directors
may by resolution appoint the time and place for holding stated
meetings of the Board, if deemed advisable; and such stated
meetings shall be held at the time and place so appointed,
without the giving of any special notice.  In case the day
appointed for the stated meeting shall fall on a legal holiday,
such meeting shall be held on the next following business day,
not a legal holiday, at the same hour.

      Section 5.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the
Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman
or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors or by the President or

to be held, or shall be sent to him or her at such place by
telegraph, or be delivered personally, or by telephone or other
oral means, not later than the day before the day on which the
meeting is to be held.  Except as otherwise provided in these
By-laws or as may be indicated in the notice thereof, any and all
business may be transacted at any special meeting.

      Section 6.  Notice of Meetings.  Notice of any meeting
of the Board of Directors or of any committee need not be given
to any director if waived by him or her in writing, whether
before or after such meeting, or if he or she shall be present at

Directors, or of any committee, shall be a legal meeting without
any notice thereof having been given, if all the members shall be
present thereat.

and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the
Delaware General Corporation Law as it presently exists or may be
hereafter amended from time to time, any person who was or is 


                                   -11-
<PAGE>
made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved
in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit,
arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative ("Proceeding") by reason of the fact that such
person, or a person for whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was 

          (a)   a director or officer of the Corporation or its
                subsidiaries, or 

          (b)   a director, officer or employee of the
                Corporation and is or was serving at the request
                of the Corporation through designation by the
                Chief Executive Officer as a director, officer,
                employee, agent or fiduciary of another
                corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
                trust, nonprofit entity or other enterprise,
                including service with respect to employee
                benefit plans, 

against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person or on
such person's behalf in connection with any such Proceeding. 
However, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person
in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was or is
authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

          Section 2.  Advancement of Expenses.  The Corporation
shall pay the reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) as
and when incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in
connection with any Proceeding described in Section 1 in advance
of its final disposition, provided, however, that such payment
shall be made only upon a receipt of an undertaking by the
director or officer to repay all expenses (including attorneys'
fees) advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this
Article or otherwise.  Payment of such expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by employees of the Corporation may be
made by the Board of Directors in its discretion upon such terms
and conditions, if any, as it deems appropriate.

          Section 3.  Rights Not Exclusive.  The rights conferred
on any person by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any
other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation, these By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise.  The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for by this Article VI shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer 

                                   -12-
<PAGE>
or employee described in Section 1 and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

          Section 4.  Claims.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Article VI, if a claim by a director, officer
or employee described in Section 1 for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not paid in full
within thirty days after a written claim therefor has been
received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to 
recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid in full all costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such
claim.  In any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden
of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested
indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law
and this Article VI.

          Section 5.  Other Indemnification.  The Corporation's
obligation to indemnify or advance expenses hereunder to a person
who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation (as
provided for in Section 1) as a director, officer, employee,
agent or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, nonprofit entity, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person is entitled
to and actually receives as indemnification or advancement of
expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, nonprofit entity, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise.

          Section 6.  Amendment or Repeal.  Any repeal or
modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall
not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any
person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to or at
the time of such repeal or modification.


                    ARTICLE VII - EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

          Section 1.  Board of Directors.  During any emergency
resulting from an attack on the United States or on a locality in
which the Corporation conducts its business or customarily holds
meetings of its Board of Directors or its stockholders or during
a nuclear or atomic disaster or during the existence of any
catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition (any of the
foregoing is hereinafter referred to as an "Emergency
Condition"), as a result of which a quorum of the Board of
Directors cannot readily be convened for action, then if at least
three members of the Executive Committee of the Board of
Directors are able and available, such members of the Executive 



                                   -13-
<PAGE>
Committee shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute a quorum
of the Board of Directors, notwithstanding any limitations or
other provisions contained in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, these By-laws or resolutions of the Board of
Directors in effect at the time of the Emergency Condition.  If
at least three members of the Executive Committee are not able
and available to act as the Board of Directors under the
foregoing circumstances, then in addition to any director or
directors who are able and available, the elected officers of the
Corporation who are able and available shall be deemed, in order
of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, directors
to the extent required to constitute a quorum of three for any
meeting of  the Board of Directors during such Emergency
Conditions.


          Section 2.  Chief Executive Officer.  If as a result of
any Emergency Condition, the Chief Executive Officer is unable or
unavailable to act, then until the Chief Executive Officer
becomes able and available to act or a new Chief Executive
Officer is elected, the senior officer of the Corporation, in
order of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, who
is able and available to act shall act as Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation.

          Section 3.  Notice of Meetings.  During an Emergency
Condition, a meeting of the Board of Directors may be called by
any director, and if none are able and available to do so, by any
elected officer of the Corporation, by notice of the time and
place given to such of the directors, or officers serving as
directors in accordance with this Article, as it may be feasible
to reach at the time and by such means as may be feasible at the
time, including publication or radio.

          Section 4.  Powers During an Emergency Condition. 
During an Emergency Condition, the Board of Directors may take
any acts in good faith deemed necessary and in the best interests
of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, changing the
head office or designating several alternative head offices or
regional offices of the Corporation, or providing for and from
time to time modifying lines of succession in the event that
during any such Emergency Condition any or all officers or agents
of the Corporation shall for any reason be rendered incapable of
discharging their duties.

          Section 5.  Liability.  No officer or director shall be
liable for any act taken in accordance with this Article during
an Emergency Condition, except for willful misconduct.

          Section 6.  Effectiveness of Other By-laws.  To the
extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article, the
other By-laws of the Corporation shall remain in effect during
any Emergency Condition and upon its termination, the provisions
of this Article shall cease to be operative.


                         ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENTS

          These By-laws may be amended or repealed, in whole or
in part, and new By-laws may be adopted, either by the affirmative 
vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders 
of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock voting together 
without regard to class, given at any meeting of stockholders or by 
a consent, or by the affirmative vote of two-thirds (calculated to 
the nearest whole number) of the total number of directors constituting 
the Board of Directors, given at any meeting of directors or by a consent.
