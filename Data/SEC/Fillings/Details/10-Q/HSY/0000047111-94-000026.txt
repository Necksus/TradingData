NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial
      statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its
      subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
      transactions.  These statements reflect all adjustments which
      are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair
      presentation of the information contained herein.  All such
      adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.


2.   Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

                                         For the Three Months Ended
                                       April 3, 1994    April 4, 1993 
                                         (in thousands of dollars)

      Interest expense                    $  9,253         $ 10,019   
      Interest income                         (371)            (719) 
      Capitalized interest                  (1,356)          (1,739)  
                                                                       
          Interest expense, net           $  7,526         $  7,561   
                                                                       

3.    Income per share has been computed based on the weighted
      average number of shares of the Common Stock and the Class B
      Common Stock outstanding during the period.  Average shares
      outstanding during the first quarter were 87,413,699 in 1994
      and 90,186,336 in 1993.  There were no shares of Preferred
      Stock outstanding during the periods presented.

      During the second quarter of 1993, the Corporation's Board of
      Directors approved a share repurchase program to acquire from
      time to time through open market or privately negotiated
      transactions up to $200 million of Common Stock.  A total of
      2,829,739 shares have been repurchased under the program of
      which 2,565,739 shares were held as Treasury Stock as of 
      April 3, 1994.


4.    The majority of inventories are valued under the last-in,
      first-out (LIFO) method.  The remaining inventories are stated
      at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. 
      Inventories were as follows:

                                 April 3, 1994     December 31, 1993
                                      (in thousands of dollars)

          Total inventories         $521,146           $453,442 
                                                                                


5.   In March 1993, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of
      $80.6 million on the sale of its 18.6% interest in Freia
      Marabou a.s.  This gain had the effect of increasing net
      income in the first quarter of 1993 by $40.6 million.  Gross
      proceeds from the sale in the amount of $259.7 million were
      received in April 1993.

 6.   In March 1993, the Corporation purchased certain assets of the
      Cleveland area Ideal Macaroni and Mrs. Weiss Noodle companies
      for approximately $14.6 million.

      In September 1993, the Corporation completed the acquisition
      of the Italian confectionery business of Heinz Italia S.p.A.
      for approximately $130.0 million.  The business is the leader
      in the Italian non-chocolate confectionery market and
      manufactures and distributes a wide range of confectionery
      products, including sugar candies and traditional products for
      special occasions such as nougat and gift boxes.
      
      In October 1993, the Corporation completed the purchase of the
      outstanding shares of Overspecht B.V. (OZF Jamin) for
      approximately $20.2 million plus the assumption of
      approximately $13.4 million in debt.  OZF Jamin manufactures
      chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products, cookies,
      biscuits and ice cream for distribution primarily to customers
      in the Netherlands and Belgium.

      In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the
      purchase prices for the above acquisitions have been allocated
      to the underlying assets and liabilities at the date of
      acquisition based on their estimated respective fair values. 
      These allocations and estimated fair values may be revised at
      a later date.  Results subsequent to the dates of acquisition
      are included in the consolidated financial statements.  Had
      the results of the acquisitions been included in consolidated
      financial results for each period presented, the effect would
      not have been material.



 7.   During the first quarter of 1993, the Corporation completed
      the early repayment of $42.1 million of long-term debt.



 8.   Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statements
      of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers'
      Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"
      and No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" by means of catch-up
      adjustments.  The net charge associated with these changes in
      accounting had the effect of decreasing net income by
      approximately $103.9 million, or $1.15 per share.



 9.   Reference is made to the Registrant's 1993 Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for more detailed financial statements and
      footnotes.

               Management's Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations - First Quarter 1994 vs. First Quarter 1993

Consolidated net sales for the first quarter fell from $897.8
million in 1993 to $883.9 million in 1994, a decrease of 2% from
the prior year.  The lower sales reflected continuing sluggish demand for
existing confectionery and grocery brands caused by weak market
conditions which began late in the first quarter of 1993 and have continued
into the first half of 1994, adverse weather and an earlier Easter
in 1994, and the timing of certain year-end promotions which shifted some 
domestic confectionery sales into the fourth quarter of 1993.  These sales
decreases were substantially offset by sales increases attributable
to new confectionery products and international businesses acquired
in the second half of 1993.  

The consolidated gross margin decreased from 43.1% in 1993 to 40.4%
in 1994.  The decrease was primarily the result of higher costs for
certain major raw materials, including flour, higher unit manufacturing
costs associated with lower sales volumes, and increased expenses for 
shipping and depreciation, partially offset by pasta selling price
increases.  Selling, marketing and administrative expenses
decreased by 4%, primarily due to lower levels of promotion and
advertising expenses related to the sales volume decline, partially
offset by higher selling expenses associated with the 1993 business
acquisitions.  

In March 1993, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of $80.6
million on the sale of its 18.6% investment interest in Freia
Marabou a.s (Freia) which increased net income by $40.6 million.

Net interest expense in the first quarter of 1994 was in line with
the comparable period of 1993 as higher short-term interest expense
and decreased capitalized interest were offset by lower fixed
interest expense resulting from the 1993 early repayment of long-
term debt.  The 1994 increase in short-term interest reflected
higher average short-term borrowing levels to finance acquisitions
and a share repurchase program.  A cumulative decrease in
expenditures qualifying for interest capitalization resulted in
lower capitalized interest in 1994. 

The first quarter effective income tax rate decreased from 43.8% in
1993 to 39.8% in 1994.  The higher rate in 1993 was due primarily
to the relatively high income taxes associated with the gain on the
sale of the Freia investment.  The 1994 effective income tax rate
reflected the increase in the Federal statutory income tax rate as
provided for in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for
Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and No. 109
"Accounting for Income Taxes" by means of catch-up adjustments. 
The net charge associated with these changes in accounting had the
effect of decreasing 1993 first quarter net income by approximately
$103.9 million, or $1.15 per share.






Financial Condition

Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
cash generated from operations.  Domestic seasonal working capital
needs, which typically peak during the summer, generally have been
met by issuing commercial paper.  During the first three months of
1994, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents increased by
$15.1 million.  Cash provided from operations and short-term
borrowings were sufficient to finance capital additions of $43.0
million, pay cash dividends of $25.8 million and fund share
repurchases of $12.5 million.  

<PAGE>
<PAGE> PAGE 8


The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 as of
April 3, 1994 and December 31, 1993.  The Corporation's
capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a
percent of stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was
30% as of April 3, 1994, and 27% as of December 31, 1993.  As of
April 3, 1994, the Corporation had $31.0 million of cash and cash
equivalents, $18.0 million of current portion of long-term debt and
$425.4 million of short-term debt.  As of April 3, 1994 the
Corporation had lines of credit with domestic and international
commercial banks in the amount of approximately $575 million which
could be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of
commercial paper.  

As of April 3, 1994, $100 million of debt securities remained
available for issuance under a Form S-3 Registration Statement
which was declared effective in June 1990 and an additional $400
million of debt securities under a Form S-3 Registration Statement
declared effective in November 1993.  Proceeds from any offering of
the $500 million of debt securities available under these shelf
registrations may be used to reduce existing commercial paper
borrowings, finance capital additions, and fund a share repurchase
program and future business acquisitions.

As of April 3, 1994, the Corporation's principal capital
commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion and
modernization.  The Corporation anticipates that capital
expenditures will be in the range of $200 million per annum during
the next several years as a result of the expansion of facilities
to support new products and continued modernization of existing
facilities.  

During the second quarter of 1993, the Corporation's Board of
Directors approved a share repurchase program to acquire from time
to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions up
to $200 million of Common Stock.  A total of 2,829,739 shares have
been repurchased under the program of which 2,565,739 shares were
held as Treasury Stock as of April 3, 1994.

Hershey, Pa.  -  Hershey Foods Corporation announced today that it expects 
earnings for the first quarter ending April 3, 1994, to be below the record 
$.71 per share earned before accounting changes and the one-time gain from the 
sale of the Corporation's Freia Marabou investment in the first quarter of 
1993.  When viewed in the context of the last six months, however, the 
Corporation's earnings are expected to be similar to the corresponding 
six-month period a year earlier.

"Last year's first quarter produced strong volume gains especially for our 
largest division, Hershey Chocolate U.S.A., making this year's comparison more 
difficult," said Kenneth L. Wolfe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  
"In 1994 an earlier Easter and the timing of certain year-end promotions 
shifted some sales into the fourth quarter of 1993.  In addition, our 
operations in the first quarter were hampered by adverse weather conditions.

"While there has been sluggishness in the U.S. confectionery market throughout 
much of 1993, there are some recent signs that growth is resuming for the 
category, and the most recent data available indicate that we continue to gain 
share in the U.S. confectionery market.

"From time to time the seasonality of our business causes earnings to shift on 
a quarterly basis, but we expect 1994 to be another good year for the 
Corporation," Wolfe concluded.
