<LI><B>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</B>

<P>The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hershey Foods
Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (the &#147;Corporation&#148;)
after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. These statements
have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the
2003 presentation. Operating results for the three months ended March 30, 2003,
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2003, because of the seasonal effects of the
Corporation&#146;s business. For more information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and notes included in the Corporation&#146;s 2002 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.</P>

<LI><B>EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS</B>

<P>As of March 30, 2003, the
Corporation had two stock-based employee compensation plans. The Corporation
applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, <I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,</I> and
related Interpretations in accounting for those plans. No stock-based employee
compensation expense is reflected in net income for employee stock options since
all stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for
performance stock units is recognized ratably over a period of up to seventy-two
months based on the quarter-end market values of the stock. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Corporation
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based</I>
<I>Compensation,</I> to stock-based employee compensation. </FONT></P>

<LI>  <B>DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES</B>

<P>The Corporation accounts
for derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, <I>Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,</I> as amended. All derivative instruments currently utilized by the
Corporation, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap
agreements and commodities futures contracts, are designated as cash flow
hedges.

<P>Net after-tax losses on
cash flow hedging derivatives reflected in comprehensive income were $9.3
million for the three months ended March 30, 2003. Net after-tax gains on cash
flow hedging derivatives reflected in comprehensive income were $17.5 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2002. Net gains and losses on cash flow
hedging derivatives were primarily associated with commodities futures
contracts. Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) to income, for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives,
were reflected in cost of sales. Reclassification of gains of $12.8 million and
$3.1 million for the three months ended March&#160;30, 2003 and March 31, 2002,
respectively, were associated with commodities futures contracts. No gains or
losses as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were incurred during the three
months ended March 30, 2003. Gains on commodities futures contracts recognized
in cost of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately $.5
million before tax for the three months ended March 31, 2002. No gains or losses
on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) into income as a result of the discontinuance of a
hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not
occur. There were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging
derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.</P>

<LI><B>   LONG-TERM DEBT</B>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In August 1997, the
Corporation filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement under which it could offer,
on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $500 million of additional debt
securities. As of March 30, 2003, $250 million of debt securities remained
available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration Statement.</P>

<LI><B>  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</B>

<P>The carrying amounts of
financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and short-term debt approximated fair value as of March 30,
2003 and December 31, 2002, because of the relatively short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current
portion, was $868.6 million as of March 30, 2003, compared to a fair value of
$1,008.2 million, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt
issues.</P>

<P>As of March 30, 2003, the
Corporation had foreign exchange forward contracts maturing in 2003 and 2004 to
purchase $39.0 million in foreign currency, primarily British sterling and
euros, and to sell $17.2 million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen, at
contracted forward rates.</P>

<P>The fair value of foreign
exchange forward contracts is estimated by obtaining quotes for future contracts
with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. As of
March 30, 2003, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was an
asset of $2.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, the fair value of foreign
exchange forward contracts was an asset of $3.1 million. The Corporation does
not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.</P>

<P>In order to minimize its
financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, the Corporation, from time
to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. In February 2001, the
Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively
converted variable-interest-rate rental payments on certain operating leases
from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%. Any interest rate differential on
interest rate swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
over the term of each agreement. The fair value of interest rate swap agreements
was a liability of $8.2 million and $7.1 million as of March&#160;30, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, respectively. The Corporation&#146;s risk related to interest
rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at
prevailing market rates.</P>

<LI>  <B>SHARE REPURCHASES</B>

<P>In December 2002, the
Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program
authorizing the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Corporation&#146;s
Common Stock. Under this program, a total of 2,911,300 shares of Common Stock
was purchased through March 30, 2003 for $187.1 million. As of March 30, 2003, a
total of 48,778,036 shares were held as Treasury Stock and $312.9 million
remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under the repurchase program.</P>

<p>

<LI> <B> NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT</B>

<P>In January 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46,
<I>Consolidation of Variable Interest </I> <I>Entities, an interpretation of ARB
No. 51</I>. This Interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises
of special-purpose entities (SPEs) to which the usual condition for
consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, <I>Consolidated
Financial Statements, </I>does not apply because the SPEs have no voting
interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting
interests.</P>

<P>The Interpretation is
effective for calendar year companies beginning in the third quarter of 2003 and
it is reasonably possible that the Interpretation will require the consolidation
of the Corporation&#146;s three off-balance sheet arrangements with SPTs for the
leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. The consolidation of
these entities will result in an increase to property, plant and equipment of
approximately $120.0 million, with a corresponding increase to long-term debt
and minority interest. The consolidation of these entities will also result in
an increase to depreciation expense of approximately $5.0 million on an annual
basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U><B>Results of
Operations - First Quarter 2003 vs. First Quarter 2002</B></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net sales for the first
quarter decreased from $988.5 million in 2002 to $953.2 million in 2003. The
decrease in sales primarily resulted from a buy-in associated with a price
increase announced in December 2002, as previously disclosed, and the continued
rationalization of certain under-performing products and brands, primarily the
divestiture of <I>Heide</I> brands and the discontinuance of the
Corporation&#146;s aseptically packaged drink products in the United States
during the second quarter of 2002. These decreases represented the majority of
the decline in sales from 2002 to 2003. Incremental sales from the January 2003
selling price increase were substantially offset by higher promotional
allowances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Cost of sales for the
quarter decreased $27.1 million, or 4%, from 2002 to 2003. The decline was
primarily caused by lower sales volume, reduced supply chain costs, and lower
costs for raw materials, primarily dairy products and peanuts, and packaging.
The consolidated gross margin increased from 36.9% in 2002 to 37.4% in 2003. The
margin expansion reflected the impact of the price increase, improved
profitability from the product and channel sales mix and the aforementioned
decreases in supply chain, raw material and packaging costs. These margin
improvements were partially offset by increased promotional expenses due to
competitive activity and maintaining promoted prices which had been committed to
prior to the January price increase. Selling, marketing and administrative
expenses decreased by 7% in the first quarter, primarily attributable to reduced
advertising and consumer promotions expenses as well as continued savings from
the Corporation&#146;s business realignment initiatives. These cost reductions
were offset slightly by increased packaging development and marketing research
expenses. Additionally, the bad debt reserve was increased by $5.0 million in
the first quarter of 2003 as an estimate of probable exposure to the bankruptcy
of Fleming Companies, Inc., announced on April 1, 2003. At the time of the
bankruptcy announcement, the Corporation&#146;s accounts receivable from Fleming
Companies, Inc. totaled approximately $15 million. At the present time, the
Corporation does not anticipate any material impact on sales for the remainder
of the year as a result of this situation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Total costs and expenses in
the first quarter of 2002 included $9.0 million of business realignment charges
reflecting a charge to cost of sales of $.2 million associated with the
relocation of manufacturing equipment and $8.8 million associated with pension
settlement costs related to the voluntary work force reduction program
implemented as part of the Corporation&#146;s business realignment initiatives. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net interest expense in the
first quarter of 2003 was $.9 million less than the comparable period of 2002,
primarily reflecting higher interest income and capitalized interest in 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net income for the first
quarter increased $10.5 million, or 12%, from 2002 to 2003, and net income per
share - diluted increased $.10, or 16%. Net income of $87.0 million for the
first quarter of 2002 included total business realignment charges of $5.7
million after tax. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U><B>Liquidity and
Capital Resources</B></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Historically, the
Corporation&#146;s major source of financing has been cash generated from
operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which typically peak during
the summer months, generally have been met by issuing commercial paper. During
the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation&#146;s cash and cash equivalents
decreased by $153.7 million. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents
reflected the repurchase of 2.9 million shares of the Corporation&#146;s Common
Stock for $187.1 million, partially offset by cash collections during the first
quarter. Cash provided from operations was sufficient to fund dividend payments
of $42.5 million, capital expenditures and capitalized software additions
totaling $40.0 million and incentive plan transactions of $29.7 million. Cash
used by other assets and liabilities of $81.4 million was principally the result
of commodities transactions and lower liabilities associated with marketing
programs and incentive compensation, partially offset by an increase in accrued
income taxes. Cash used by other assets and liabilities of $68.5 million in the
first quarter of 2002 primarily reflected a pension plan contribution of $75.0
million and changes to liabilities associated with taxes and incentive
compensation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The ratio of current assets
to current liabilities was 2.1:1 as of March 30, 2003, and 2.3:1 as of
December&#160;31, 2002. The Corporation&#146;s capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders&#146; equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 42% as of March 30, 2003, and 39% as of
December 31, 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), within
the 90 days prior to the filing date of this report, the Corporation conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Corporation&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was
carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the
Corporation&#146;s management, including the Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Corporation&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have
been no significant changes in the Corporation&#146;s internal controls or in
other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to
the date of the evaluation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Disclosure controls and
procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Corporation&#146;s reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Corporation&#146;s reports filed under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. </FONT></P>

<TEXT>

                                                                      Exhibit 10

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                           AMENDED AND RESTATED (2003)
                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN



         1.    PURPOSE OF PLAN. The purpose of the Amended and Restated (2003)
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, effective as of March 1, 2003,
(hereinafter called the "Plan") is to obtain for Hershey Foods Corporation
(hereinafter called the "Corporation") all of the benefits which flow from
maintaining a strong management team by providing to executive and upper level
management employees the means to continue their attained standard of living
during retirement and by offering benefits that will assist in attracting
executive and upper level management employees of outstanding ability. The Plan
constitutes an amendment, restatement and continuation of the prior plan which
was most recently restated as of August 19, 2002.

               To the extent provided by law, the benefits provided hereunder
with respect to any Participant who retired or whose employment with the
Corporation terminated prior to March 1, 2003, will, except as otherwise
specifically provided for herein, be governed in all respects by the terms of
the plan document then in effect on the date of the Participant's retirement or
other termination of employment.

         2.    DEFINITIONS.  The  following  words and  phrases  as used in the
Plan shall have the following  meanings,  unless a different  meaning is plainly
required by the context:

               a. "Cause" means, as determined by the Committee in its
reasonable discretion, the willful engaging by an employee of the Corporation in
illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably
injurious to the Corporation, including, without limitation, illegal conduct or
gross misconduct that causes, or has the potential to cause, material financial
or reputational injury to the Corporation.

               For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act, on
the part of an employee of the Corporation, shall be considered "willful" unless
it is done, or omitted to be done, by the employee in bad faith and without
reasonable belief that the employee's action or omission was in the best
interest of the Corporation. Any act or failure to act, based upon prior
approval given by the Board or upon the instruction or with the approval of the
Chief Executive Officer or the employee's superior or based upon the advice of
counsel for the Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
omitted to be done, by the employee in good faith and in the best interest of
the Corporation.

               b. "Committee" means the Compensation and Executive
Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the
"Board") or other such person, persons or committees as the Board may prescribe
from time to time.
<PAGE>


               Effective as of October 2, 2001, Committee shall also mean the
Employee Benefits Committee of the Corporation, to which the Board has delegated
certain duties with respect to the administration of the Corporation's employee
benefit plans, or any successor committee as designated by the Board.

               c. "Deferred Retirement Date" means the first day of the month
following an employee's termination of employment with the Corporation provided
such termination occurs after his Normal Retirement Date.

               d. "Disability" or "Disabled", for purposes of this Plan,
shall have the same meaning as provided in Section 1.16 of the Retirement Plan,
as such section may be amended from time to time.

               e. "Early Retirement Date" means the first day of any month
following an employee's termination of employment with the Corporation which is
coincident with or following his fifty-fifth (55th) birthday and prior to his
Normal Retirement Date.

               f. "Final Average Compensation" means the sum of (1) the
highest annual average of a Vested Participant's basic salary paid or accrued
over any thirty-six (36) consecutive month period during his last ten (10) years
of employment with the Corporation and (2) the highest annual average of his
annual awards under the Annual Incentive Program (hereinafter called the "AIP")
of the Corporation's Key Employee Incentive Plan ("KEIP") paid or accrued over
any five (5) consecutive calendar years during his last ten (10) years of
employment with the Corporation. If a Vested Participant dies, retires, or
suffers a Disability or if a Participant suffers a Disability during a calendar
year and only a partial AIP award is made for that year, for purposes of the
Plan, his AIP award for such year will be considered to equal the award actually
made divided by the fraction of such year that he was employed by the
Corporation prior to his death, retirement or Disability. If a Vested

Corporation, and who retires (or whose employment is otherwise terminated, other
than for Cause) on or after his Normal Retirement Date shall be entitled under
the Plan to receive a normal retirement benefit which shall be an annual
benefit, payable in monthly installments, equal to:

<PAGE>

                 (1)  the product of three and  two-thirds  percent (3 2/3%) of
          his Final Average  Compensation and his Years of Service not in excess
          of fifteen (15) Years of Service;

                 reduced by:

                 (2)  one hundred percent (100%) of the Vested
         Participant's retirement benefit under the Retirement Plan and any
         other tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan maintained by the
         Corporation or any affiliate thereof, payable as a life annuity
         commencing at his Normal Retirement Date or his Deferred Retirement
         Date if he retires after his Normal Retirement Date, regardless of
         whether such benefit payment is in that form or begins at that time;
         and

                 (3)  one hundred percent (100%) of the primary social
         security benefit to which the Vested Participant would be entitled on
         his Normal Retirement Date or his Deferred Retirement Date if he
         retires after his Normal Retirement Date regardless of whether he
         receives any portion of such primary Social Security benefit on such
         date.

               Payment of such benefit shall commence on his Normal
Retirement Date if he retires (or otherwise has his employment terminated, other
than for Cause) on such date and on his Deferred Retirement Date if he retires
(or otherwise has his employment terminated, other than for Cause) after his
Normal Retirement Date.

               b. Early Retirement Benefit. An employee who qualifies as a
Vested Participant on the date of his termination of employment with the
Corporation, and who retires (or whose employment is otherwise terminated, other
than for Cause) on or after his Early Retirement Date and prior to his Normal
Retirement Date shall be entitled under the Plan to receive an early retirement
benefit which shall be an annual benefit payable in monthly installments, equal
to:

                 (1)  the product of three and two-thirds percent (3
         2/3%) of his Final Average Compensation and his Years of Service not in
         excess of fifteen (15) Years of Service reduced by the sum of (2), (3)
         and (4), where (2), (3) and (4) equal:

                 (2)  one hundred percent (100%) of his retirement
         benefit under the Retirement Plan and any other tax-qualified defined
         benefit pension plan maintained by the Corporation or any affiliate
         thereof, payable as a life annuity commencing at his Early Retirement
         Date or the first date thereafter on which such benefits would be
         payable if they are not payable on his Early Retirement Date regardless
         of whether such benefit payment is in that form or begins at that time;

                 (3)  one hundred percent (100%) of the primary Social
         Security benefit to which the Vested Participant would be entitled on
         his Early Retirement Date or the first date thereafter on which such
         benefits would be payable if they are not payable on his Early
         Retirement Date regardless of whether he receives any portion of such
         primary Social Security benefit on such date; and
<PAGE>

                 (4)  the product of (A) the difference between (1) and
         the sum of (2) and (3), (B) five-twelfths of a percent (5/12%), and (C)
         the number of complete calendar months by which the Vested
         Participant's date of termination of employment precedes his sixtieth
         (60th) birthday.

               Payment of such benefit shall commence on the first day of the
month coincident with the Vested Participant's retirement or other termination
of employment, other than for Cause.

               c. Disability Retirement Benefit. If an employee who is an
active participant in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP suffers a
Disability prior to his Normal Retirement Date and while employed by the
Corporation, the period of his Disability will be recognized as Years of Service
and as years of participation in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP
under the Plan. If such Disability continues to his Normal Retirement Date, for
purposes of the Plan, he will retire on that date and will be entitled to a
normal retirement benefit calculated in accordance with Section 4.a. commencing
on that date. In calculating the benefit under Section 4.a., the Participant's
Final Average Compensation shall be equal to his annual base compensation
immediately prior to his Disability plus the average of his AIP earned during
the three (3) years immediately prior to the commencement of his Disability.

               d. Pre-Retirement Death Benefit. If a Participant dies before
his employment by the Corporation terminates and qualifies as a Vested
Participant on his date of death, his designated beneficiary(ies), or his estate
if he has not designated any beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with
procedures established by the Committee, shall receive within ten (10) days of
the Vested Participant's death a death benefit equal to the lump sum present
value of one hundred percent (100%) of the retirement benefit that would have
been payable to the Vested Participant under Sections 4.a. or 4.b. (including
the spousal survivor benefit payable pursuant to Section 4.e. with respect to
any Vested Participant survived by a spouse) if he had retired on the date of
his death. The lump sum present value of the retirement benefit shall be
calculated using: (x) for each Vested Participant who was a Vested Participant
on January 1, 1998, (i) the 83 GAM mortality tables; and (ii) an interest rate
equal to the sum of one-twelfth (1/12th) of each PBGC Interest Rate for the
twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of the Vested Participant's
death; and (y) for each Vested Participant who first became a Vested Participant
after January 1, 1998, (i) the prevailing commissioner's standard mortality
table (described in Section 807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended from time to time) used to determine reserves for group annuity
contracts issued on the date of the Vested Participant's death (without regard
to any other subparagraph for such Section 807(d)(5)) that is prescribed by the
Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service in revenue rulings, notices, or
other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin; and (ii) an interest
rate equal to the Lump Sum Interest Rate as of the date of the Vested
Participant's death. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary,
the lump sum cash value of the benefit described in this Section 4.d. with
respect to each Vested Participant who (A) was a Vested Participant as of
January 1, 1998 and (B) whose employment with the Corporation terminated due to
his or her death on or after January 1,

<PAGE>
2002,  shall be equal to the  greater of the value of the lump sum cash  payment
calculated pursuant to the rates and factors set forth in subsections (x) or (y)
of this paragraph.

               e. Post-Retirement Death Benefit. If a Vested Participant who
is receiving monthly retirement benefits under this Plan following his
termination of employment by the Corporation dies, his surviving spouse, if he
is survived by a spouse, shall be entitled to receive a death benefit which
shall be a monthly payment for the spouse's life, beginning on the first day of
the month following the Vested Participant's death, equal to:

                 (1)  fifty  percent  (50%) of the  monthly  retirement  benefit
         to which the Vested  Participant  was entitled under the Plan prior to
         his death;

                  reduced by:

                 (2)  the monthly annuity value of any life insurance
         provided by the Corporation or any affiliate thereof for retired
         employees that is in excess of post-retirement group term life
         insurance regularly provided by the Corporation or any affiliate
         thereof.

         5.    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN. The Committee is charged with the
administration of the Plan. It shall have full power and authority to construe
and interpret the Plan. Its decisions shall be final, conclusive and binding on
all parties. Subject to Section 10 of this Plan, the Committee shall also have
the power, in its sole discretion, at any time (i) to waive, in whole or in
part, application of any of the eligibility requirements of Section 3 or of the
benefit reduction factors in Sections 4.a. and 4.b. and (ii) to determine the
timing and form of payment of any benefit under the Plan, in the case of any
individual Participant, Vested Participant or other employee of the Corporation
who has participated in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP.

         6.    OPTIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT. In lieu of the monthly retirement
benefit (including the spousal survivor benefit payable pursuant to Section 4.e.
hereof) payable pursuant to Section 4.a. or 4.b. hereof to a Vested  Participant
(and his surviving  spouse) who retires (or whose employment is terminated other

Participant  and/or his surviving  spouse is herein  referred to for purposes of
this Section 6 as the "Applicable Retirement Benefit"),  such Vested Participant
may elect to receive the following form of benefit payment:

               A lump sum cash payment, payable to the Vested Participant

Cause), calculated in accordance with the Corporation's practices for
determining retirement benefits; and (y) for

rates and factors set forth in subsections (x) or (y) of this paragraph.

               Any such election must be made by those Participants
designated by the Committee from time to time at least two (2) years and by all

                      person's benefit.
               4.     directly in payment of expenses of support, maintenance
                      or education of such person.

               The Corporation shall not be required to see to the
application by any third party of any payments made pursuant to the Plan.

               b. The Committee may, in its discretion, suspend or terminate
the benefits provided by the Plan to any Vested Participant, the spouse of such
Vested Participant or any other person succeeding to the interests under the
Plan of such Vested Participant, who first receives benefit payments under the
Plan after March 1, 2003 if such Vested Participant (i) was not a Vested
Participant under the Plan on March 1, 2003; and (ii) engaged in any conduct or
misconduct while employed by the Corporation that the Committee reasonably
determines constitutes Cause under the Plan. Such suspension or termination of
benefits shall apply prospectively from and after the date of the Committee's
determination that such conduct or

<PAGE>

 misconduct constitutes Cause.

         9.    EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN. This Amended and Restated (2003)
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan shall be effective March 1, 2003 and
Vested Participants who become eligible to retire under the Plan on or after
that date shall be entitled to the benefits provided hereunder.

         10.   AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation may, at any time, suspend or terminate the Plan.
The Board, or its duly appointed delegee, if applicable, may also from time to
time, amend the Plan in such respects as it may deem advisable in order that
benefits provided hereunder may conform to any change in law or in other
respects which the Board, or its delegee in accordance with the Board's
delegation of authority thereto, deems to be in the best interest of the
Corporation. No such suspension, termination or amendment of the Plan shall
adversely affect any right of any person who is a Vested Participant at the time
of such suspension, termination or amendment or his beneficiary(ies), estate or
surviving spouse, as applicable, to receive benefits under the Plan in
accordance with its provisions in effect immediately prior to such suspension,
termination or amendment without the consent of such Vested Participant,
beneficiary(ies), estate or surviving spouse. Any benefits payable under the
terms of the Plan at the time of any suspension, termination or amendment of the
Plan shall remain in effect according to their original terms, or such alternate
terms as may be in the best interests of both parties and agreed to by the
Vested Participant or his beneficiaries, estate or surviving spouse, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Plan may not be terminated or
amended in any manner that is adverse to the interests of a Participant or the
surviving spouse of a Participant without the consent of the Participant or
surviving spouse, as applicable, either: (i) after a Potential Change in Control
occurs and for one (1) year following the cessation of the Potential Change in
Control, or (ii) for a two (2) year period beginning on the date of a Change in
Control (the "Coverage Period"); and (b) no termination of this Plan or
amendment hereof in a manner adverse to the interests of any Participant, or
such Participant's surviving spouse, (without the consent of the Participant or
surviving spouse) shall be effective if such termination or amendment occurs (i)
at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to
effect a Change in Control, or (ii) in connection with or in anticipation of a
Change in Control. After the Coverage Period, the Plan may not be amended or
terminated in any manner that would adversely affect the entitlement of a
Participant or his surviving spouse (without the consent of the Participant or
surviving spouse) to benefits that have accrued hereunder. For purposes of the
immediately preceding two sentences of this Section 10, whether an employee of
the Corporation qualifies as a Participant shall be determined at the time (a)
the Coverage Period commences and any time thereafter or (b) his employment is
terminated or the Plan is amended (i) at the request of a third party who has
taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control, or (ii) in
connection with or in anticipation of a Change in Control.
