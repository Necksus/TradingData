                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q, in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"   "projects,"   "will  likely   result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

        -   war and acts of terrorism;

        -   prevailing  governmental  policies and regulatory actions, including
            those of the United States Congress,  state legislatures,  the FERC,
            the  MPUC,   the  FPSC,  the  NCUC,  the  PSCW  and  various  county
            regulators, about allowed rates of return, financings,  industry and
            rate  structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities,
            operation  and  construction  of  plant   facilities,   recovery  of
            purchased power and capital investments,  and present or prospective
            wholesale  and  retail  competition  (including  but not  limited to
            transmission  costs)  as  well  as  general   vehicle-related  laws,
            including vehicle brokerage and auction laws;

        -   unanticipated impacts of  restructuring  initiatives in the electric
            industry;

        -   economic and geographic factors, including  political  and  economic
            risks;

        -   changes  in  and compliance  with environmental  and safety laws and
            policies;

        -   weather conditions;

        -   population growth rates and demographic patterns;

        -   the effects of competition, including the competition for retail and
            wholesale  customers,  as  well  as  suppliers   and  purchasers  of
            vehicles;

        -   pricing and transportation of commodities;

        -   market demand, including structural market changes;

        -   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

        -   unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;

        -   unanticipated   changes   in   operating    expenses   and   capital
            expenditures;

        -   capital market conditions;

        -   competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;

        -   our ability to  manage expansion and  integrate recent acquisitions;
            and

        -   the outcome  of  legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil
            or  criminal)   and   settlements   that  affect  the  business  and
            profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

included.  The results of operations  for an interim  period may not give a true
indication of results for the year. The financial  information for prior periods
has been  reclassified to reflect as discontinued  operations our Water Services
businesses,  our  auto  transport  business,  and our  retail  business-Electric

NOTE 2.    OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

AFC,  through a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  sells  certain  finance  receivables
through a revolving private  securitization  structure.  On May 31, 2002 AFC and
the subsidiary entered into a revised  securitization  agreement that allows for
the revolving  sale by the  subsidiary to third parties of up to $500 million in
undivided  interests  in eligible  finance  receivables.  The revised  agreement
expires in 2005.  The  securitization  agreement  in place prior to May 31, 2002
limited the sale of undivided interests to $325 million. In conjunction with the
revised securitization agreement and in accordance with SFAS 140 "Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,"
AFC, for accounting  purposes,  began  consolidating  the subsidiary used in the
securitization  structure  on June 1, 2002 and  reclassified  prior  periods  to
conform to the current year  presentation.  Previously,  AFC's  interest in this
subsidiary  was recorded as residual  interest in other current  assets  ($103.0
million at December 31,  2001) net of the  subsidiary's  allowance  for doubtful
accounts.

AFC managed total receivables of $535.7 million at June 30, 2002; $215.9 million
represent  receivables  which  were  included  in  accounts  receivable  on  our
consolidated  balance sheet and $319.8  million  represent  receivables  sold in
undivided  interests  through  the  securitization  agreement  ($267  million at
December 31, 2001) which are off-balance  sheet. AFC's proceeds from the sale of
the  receivables to third parties were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund new loans to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the  subsidiary  must each maintain
certain  financial  covenants such as minimum  tangible net worth to comply with
the terms of the securitization agreement.



NOTE 3.    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We adopted SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in January 2002 and
accordingly  no longer  amortize  goodwill.  We completed the required  goodwill
impairment testing in the first quarter of 2002 with no resulting impairment. No
event or change has occurred  that would  indicate the carrying  amount has been
impaired  since our annual test.  SFAS 142 requires  disclosure of what reported
net income and  earnings  per share  would  have been in all  periods  presented
exclusive  of  amortization  expense  recognized  in those  periods  related  to
goodwill or other  intangible  assets that are no longer  being  amortized.  All
goodwill amortization related to continuing operations.

NOTE 4.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In September 2001 we began a process of systematically evaluating our businesses
to determine the  strategic  value of our assets and explore ways to unlock that
value. As a result, our management and Board of Directors committed to a plan to
sell our  Water  Services  businesses  and our auto  transport  business.  Water
Services includes water and wastewater services operated by several wholly owned
subsidiaries in Florida,  North Carolina and Georgia.  We anticipate selling our
Water  Services  businesses  by the end of 2002 or early 2003.  During the first
half of 2002 we exited our nonregulated water  subsidiaries,  our auto transport
business,  and our retail  business-Electric  Odyssey. The financial results for
all of these  businesses  have been  accounted for as  discontinued  operations.
Accordingly, we ceased depreciation of assets related to these businesses in the
fourth quarter of 2001.

NOTE 7.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the quarter ended June 30, 2002 total comprehensive income was $44.8 million
($52.8  million for the quarter ended June 30,  2001).  For the six months ended
June 30, 2002 total  comprehensive  income was $78.0 million  ($79.2 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2001).  Total  comprehensive  income  includes net
income,    unrealized   gains   and   losses   on   securities   classified   as
available-for-sale,  changes  in the fair  value of an  interest  rate  swap and
foreign currency translation adjustments.



NOTE 8.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS  143,   "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement   Obligations,"   requires  the
recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in
which it is incurred.  When the  liability is initially  recorded,  the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time,
the  liability  is  accreted to its  present  value and the related  capitalized
charge is depreciated  over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective
for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  Currently,  decommissioning
amounts  collected  in  Minnesota  Power's  rates are  reported  in  accumulated
depreciation, which upon adoption of SFAS 143 will require a reclassification to
a  liability.  We are  reviewing  what  additional  assets,  if  any,  may  have
associated  retirement  costs as defined by SFAS 143 and  anticipate no material
impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.



NOTE 9.    SQUARE BUTTE POWER PURCHASED CONTRACT

Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase  agreement with Square Butte that extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in our electric service  territory and enables Minnesota Power to meet
power pool  reserve  requirements.  Square  Butte,  a North  Dakota  cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-MW coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center, North
Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a generating  unit owned by  Minnkota,  a North
Dakota cooperative  corporation whose Class A members are also members of Square
Butte. Minnkota serves as the operator of the Unit and also purchases power from
Square Butte.

Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's  output
under the  Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance
notice  requirement,  Minnkota  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  Minnesota Power
is  obligated  to pay its pro  rata  share  of  Square  Butte's  costs  based on
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to  Unit  output.   Minnesota  Power's  payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service.  At June 30, 2002 Square Butte had total debt
outstanding  of $299.1  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be approximately $36 million in each of the years 2002 and 2003, and
$23 million in each of the years 2004 through  2006.  Variable  operating  costs
include the price of coal purchased from BNI Coal, Ltd., our subsidiary, under a
long-term  contract.  Minnesota Power's payments to Square Butte are approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

NET INCOME

The  following net income  discussion  summarizes a comparison of the six months
ended June 30, 2002 to the six months ended June 30, 2001.

ENERGY  SERVICES'  net income in 2002  decreased  $3.4  million,  or 15 percent,
primarily  due to weaker  wholesale  market  conditions.  Last  year's  stronger
economy and colder winter weather  resulted in higher  wholesale  prices.  Total
retail megawatthour sales were similar to last year.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  reported a $15.3 million,  or 40 percent,  increase in net
income and a 9 percent  increase in EBITDAL over 2001.  The continued  growth in
net income was  primarily  due to higher  conversion  rates (the  percentage  of
vehicles  sold  from  those  that  were  offered  at  auction),   improved  cost
efficiencies,  a mandated accounting change which resulted in the discontinuance
of goodwill  amortization  and lower interest rates. The conversion rate related
to wholesale vehicles sold was 63 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2002
(61 percent for the same period in 2001). In 2002 the number of vehicles sold at
our wholesale auction  facilities were similar to last year. Fleet downsizing by
rental car companies  after  September  11, 2001 resulted in increased  sales of
factory vehicles at our auction  facilities during the fourth quarter of 2001 to
the  detriment  of the first six months of 2002.  Vehicle  sales in other higher
margin  categories  and strong  conversion  rates in 2002  helped  mitigate  the
reduction in sales of factory vehicles.  Vehicles sold at our total loss vehicle
auction  facilities  were up 36 percent from 2001. AFC contributed 30 percent of
the net income for Automotive Services in 2002 (33 percent in 2001) and reported
a 5 percent increase in the number of vehicles financed. Net income in 2002 also
included  a $0.8  million  charge  associated  with the exit from our 44 percent
ownership in a Canadian auto transport business.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES reported $15.5 million less net income in 2002
due to  smaller  real  estate  transactions  in 2002 and  lower  returns  on our
securities portfolio.  In June 2001 our real estate operations reported an $11.1
million gain on its largest single sale ever. Our securities  portfolio earned a
negative 0.33 percent after-tax annualized return in 2002 compared to a positive
10.02 percent in 2001.  This  decrease was partially  offset by more income from
our emerging technology investments.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS was up $2.2 million  primarily due to the suspension of
depreciation on our Water Services  assets.  Our Water Services  businesses also
reported a 12 percent increase in water consumption as a result of drier weather
conditions and a 4 percent increase in customers. These increases were partially
offset  by $3.1  million  of exit  charges  associated  with the auto  transport
business and the retail business-Electric Odyssey.


COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 AND 2001

ENERGY SERVICES

OPERATING  REVENUE was up $6.6 million,  or 4 percent,  in 2002 primarily due to
increased revenue from power marketing activities and Enventis Telecom.  Revenue
from power  marketing  activities was $9.2 million higher in 2002 reflecting the
inclusion  of $8.1  million  of  revenue  from  merchant  generation  operations
(non-rate  base  generation   sold  at  market-based   rates  pursuant  to  FERC
authority),  and $5.3  million  for  mark-to-market  income  related  to  energy
contracts  ($1.5 million in 2001).  The increase in revenue from power marketing
activities, however, was negatively impacted by weak wholesale market conditions
which reduced  wholesale prices in 2002.  Revenue from Enventis Telecom was $3.3
million higher in 2002  reflecting the July 2001  acquisition of Enventis,  Inc.
These increases were partially offset by a $5.5 million decrease in revenue from
retail  electric  sales  which was  primarily  attributed  to lower fuel  clause
recovery  because of lower fuel costs in 2002. Total retail  megawatthour  sales
were similar to last year.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in both 2002 and 2001.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both
2002 and  2001.  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 4  percent  of
consolidated operating revenue in 2002 (5 percent in 2001).

OPERATING  EXPENSES were up $6.6 million,  or 5 percent,  in 2002 reflecting the
inclusion of merchant generation and Enventis, Inc. operations.  These increases
were partially offset by reduced maintenance  expenses.  In 2001 the Company had
higher plant maintenance expenses and additional costs incurred as a result of a
severe ice storm.

<PAGE>


AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $2.9 million,  or 1 percent,  in 2002 reflecting strong
conversion rates at wholesale auction  facilities.  At ADESA,  454,000 wholesale
vehicles  were sold in 2002  (458,000 in 2001).  The number of vehicles sold was
impacted by a reduction in factory vehicles  brought to auction.  Stronger sales
in other vehicle  categories  helped mitigate the reduction in factory vehicles.
In addition,  at our total loss vehicle  auctions,  47,000 vehicles were sold in
2002 (34,000 in 2001), an increase of 38 percent.

Operating revenue from AFC was higher in 2002 reflecting a 4 percent increase in
vehicles   financed   through  its  loan   production   offices.   AFC  financed
approximately  241,000  vehicles in 2002  (232,000  in 2001) and  managed  total
receivables of $536 million at June 30, 2002 ($480 million at June 30, 2001).

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $11.8 million,  or 7 percent, in 2002 primarily due
to improved cost  efficiencies,  reduced  interest  expense ($4.3  million) as a
result of lower interest rates, and the discontinuance of goodwill  amortization
($3.3  million).  These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by an  increase  in
operating  expenses  incurred to  standardize  operations  at all our total loss
auction facilities and expenditures for information technology initiatives.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

OPERATING REVENUE was down $37.9 million,  or 88 percent,  in 2002 primarily due
to a large real estate  transaction  recorded  in 2001.  In 2002 our real estate
operations  reported  no large real estate  sales,  while in 2001 two large real
estate sales  contributed  $30.4  million to revenue,  one of which was our real
estate  operations'  largest single transaction ever. Income from our securities
portfolio and emerging technology investments was also lower in 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $12.7 million, or 48 percent, in 2002 primarily due
to expenses associated with larger real estate sales in 2001.


COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 AND 2001

ENERGY SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was down $9.5 million,  or 3 percent, in 2002 primarily due to
a $16.9  million  decrease in revenue from retail  electric and gas sales.  This
decrease was attributed to warmer winter weather and lower fuel clause  recovery
due to lower fuel costs in 2002. Total retail megawatthour sales were similar to
last year. Revenue from power marketing activities was down $2.1 million in 2002
due to weak wholesale market  conditions which reduced wholesale prices in 2002.
This decrease was  partially  offset by the inclusion of $8.1 million of revenue
from merchant generation operations,  and $5.3 million for mark-to-market income
related to energy contracts in 2002 ($1.5 million in 2001). Revenue in 2002 also
included $8.0 million more revenue from  Enventis  Telecom  reflecting  the July
2001 acquisition of Enventis, Inc.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in both 2002 and 2001.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both
2002 and  2001.  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 4  percent  of
consolidated operating revenue in 2002 (6 percent in 2001).

OPERATING  EXPENSES  were  down  $4.0  million,  or 1  percent,  in 2002  due to
decreased purchased power and maintenance expenses.  Purchased power expense was
down $15.0 million in 2002 because  prices paid for purchased  power were lower,
Company generation was up 6 percent and 2 percent fewer megawatthours were sold.
Purchased  gas  expense  was lower in 2002  because in 2001  prices paid were at
record  highs.  In 2001 the Company had higher  plant  maintenance  expenses and
additional  costs  incurred as a result of a severe ice storm.  These  decreases
were partially offset by the inclusion of merchant generation and Enventis, Inc.
operations.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $11.5 million,  or 3 percent, in 2002 reflecting strong
conversion rates at wholesale auction  facilities.  At ADESA,  915,000 wholesale
vehicles  were sold in 2002  (924,000 in 2001).  The number of vehicles sold was
impacted by a reduction in factory vehicles  brought to auction.  Stronger sales
in other vehicle  categories  helped mitigate the reduction in factory vehicles.
In addition,  at our total loss vehicle  auctions,  94,000 vehicles were sold in
2002 (69,000 in 2001), an increase of 36 percent.

Operating revenue from AFC was higher in 2002 reflecting a 5 percent increase in
vehicles   financed   through  our  loan   production   offices.   AFC  financed
approximately  478,000  vehicles in 2002  (453,000  in 2001) and  managed  total
receivables of $536 million at June 30, 2002 ($480 million at June 30, 2001).

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $13.3 million,  or 4 percent, in 2002 primarily due
to improved cost  efficiencies,  reduced  interest  expense ($9.2  million) as a
result of lower interest rates, and the discontinuance of goodwill  amortization
($6.6  million).  These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by an  increase  in
operating  expenses  incurred to  standardize  operations  at all our total loss
auction  facilities and  expenditures  for information  technology  initiatives.
Also,  operating expenses in 2001 reflected  additional expenses for utility and
labor costs incurred as a result of inclement weather conditions.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

OPERATING REVENUE was down $34.3 million,  or 61 percent,  in 2002 primarily due
to a large real estate transaction recorded in 2001. Two large real estate sales
in 2002  contributed  $4.9  million  to  revenue,  while in 2001 four large real
estate sales  contributed  $33.1  million to revenue,  one of which was our real
estate  operations'  largest single  transaction  ever.  Operating  revenue also
reflected  less income from the  securities  portfolio  due to lower  returns in
2002.  Operating  revenue from our emerging  technology  investments was up $0.5
million in 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $8.5 million,  or 22 percent, in 2002 primarily due
to expenses associated with larger real estate sales in 2001.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Certain accounting measurements under applicable generally accepted accounting
principles involve management's judgment about subjective factors and estimates,
the effects of which are inherently uncertain. The following summarizes those
accounting measurements we believe are most critical to our reported results of

OUTLOOK

Based on a mid-year review of our businesses,  we have revised our 2002 earnings
per share  estimate  to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.10,  excluding  $0.05 per
share of charges  related to the exit from the auto  transport  business and the
retail business-Electric  Odyssey, and any potential gain recognized on the sale
of our Water Services businesses. This estimate reflects the goodwill accounting
change  and   incorporates   our  year  to  date  performance  and  our  revised
expectations  for the second half of 2002 which include the  liquidation  of our
trading securities portfolio and lower wholesale power prices.

We have  decided to  liquidate  our trading  securities  portfolio to reduce our
exposure to increased  volatility in the securities market. At June 30, 2002 the
fair value of our trading securities  portfolio was $157.2 million.  Our revised
earnings estimate for 2002 reflects a $0.10 per share income reduction due to no
contribution  from  our  trading  securities  portfolio.  No  gain  or  loss  on
liquidation  is expected.  With the  proceeds we plan to reduce  debt.  The cash
generated from this decision as well as from our  continuing  operations and the
expected sale of our Water  Services'  assets will fuel our future  growth.  Our
balance   sheet  remains   strong.   We  continue  to  focus  on  our  two  core
competencies-Energy   Services  and   Automotive   Services,   and  work  toward
positioning each of them to continue our earnings growth track record.

ENERGY SERVICES.  Our new merchant generation  facilities at the Taconite Harbor
Energy  Center  in  northern  Minnesota  and in  Kendall  County  near  Chicago,
Illinois,  became fully  operational  by the second  quarter of 2002.  The third
quarter is  typically  the highest net income  quarter for our Energy  Services'
business,  and the third  quarter of 2002 is expected  to follow the  historical
pattern.  While our base retail  electric  business  remains  stable,  we do not
expect  that  wholesale  power  margins  will return to the high levels of a few
years  ago,  but we do  expect  improvement  during  the third  quarter  of 2002
compared  to the first  half of 2002.  The extent of our  profitability  will be
impacted by wholesale power prices during the third quarter of 2002.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES.  The second  quarter 2002  performance  of our  Automotive
Services business demonstrated our ability to drive efficiencies at our auctions
acquired since January 2000 and generate profits.  We expect to continue EBITDAL
and revenue  improvement,  and double digit  earnings  growth into 2003. We also
expect that the factory  vehicle  volume at our  auctions  will return to normal
levels  later this year.  We remain on target to achieve our  previously  stated
goal of 30 percent earnings growth (20 percent excluding the goodwill accounting
change) over 2001. In addition,  we anticipate continued growth in the number of
vehicles sold and financed at auction.  We expect a 5 percent  increase in total
vehicles both sold and financed over 2001.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES. We anticipate net income from Investments and
Corporate  Charges  to  decline in 2002 due to the  liquidation  of our  trading
securities portfolio and, as expected, a lower contribution from our real estate
operations.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS.  We remain  engaged  in  discussions  relating  to the
planned sale of our Water Services  businesses.  The FGUA has delayed taking any
action on the proposed  purchase of Florida Water assets until  September  2002.
The FGUA has stated its intent to advise Florida Water which utility  systems it
desires to purchase and the purchase  price for these  utility  systems,  and to
seek finalized definitive agreements.  We continue to work with them at the same
time that we explore other sales  opportunities.  ALLETE has hired an investment
banker to facilitate the sale of Heater Utilities and Georgia Water Services. We
expect to close these  transactions  in late 2002 or early 2003. In June 2002 we
completed our exit from the auto transport business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES

During  the first  six  months  of 2002  cash  flow  from  operating  activities
reflected  strong  operating  results  and  continued  focus on working  capital
management.  Cash flow from  operating  activities was higher in 2002 due to the
timing of the collection of certain finance receivables  outstanding at December
31,  2001  and  changes  in  trading  securities.  In  2001  additional  trading
securities  were  purchased  with a portion of the proceeds  from a common stock
issuance.  Cash flow from  operations  was also  affected by a number of factors
representative of normal operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper. In July 2002 we began liquidating our
trading securities  portfolio through a process we anticipate  completing by the
end of September 2002.  With the proceeds we plan to reduce debt.  Approximately
5.0 million original issue shares of our common stock are available for issuance
through INVEST DIRECT, our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided.  However, ADESA has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for dealers to purchase  vehicles at
auctions in exchange for a security  interest in each vehicle.  The financing is
provided  through  the  earlier  of the date the dealer  sells the  vehicle or a
general  borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC has  arrangements  to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet its working  capital
requirements.

AFC,  through a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  sells  certain  finance  receivables
through a revolving private  securitization  structure.  On May 31, 2002 AFC and
the subsidiary entered into a revised  securitization  agreement that allows for
the revolving  sale by the  subsidiary to third parties of up to $500 million in
undivided  interests  in eligible  finance  receivables.  The revised  agreement
expires in 2005.  The  securitization  agreement  in place prior to May 31, 2002
limited the sale of undivided interests to $325 million. In conjunction with the
revised securitization agreement and in accordance with SFAS 140 "Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,"
AFC, for accounting  purposes,  began  consolidating  the subsidiary used in the
securitization  structure  on June 1, 2002 and  reclassified  prior  periods  to
conform to the current year  presentation.  Previously,  AFC's  interest in this
subsidiary  was recorded as residual  interest in other current  assets  ($103.0
million at December 31,  2001) net of the  subsidiary's  allowance  for doubtful
accounts.

AFC managed total receivables of $535.7 million at June 30, 2002; $215.9 million
represent  receivables  which  were  included  in  accounts  receivable  on  our
consolidated  balance sheet and $319.8  million  represent  receivables  sold in
undivided  interests  through  the  securitization  agreement  ($267  million at
December 31, 2001) which are off-balance  sheet. AFC's proceeds from the sale of
the  receivables to third parties were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund new loans to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the  subsidiary  must each maintain
certain  financial  covenants such as minimum  tangible net worth to comply with
the terms of the securitization agreement.

Significant changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at June
30, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001 were due to increased sales and financing
activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down during the
winter months and in December because of the holidays.  As a result,  Automotive
Services had higher receivables and higher payables at June 30, 2002.

We provide up to $50 million in credit support to facilitate the power marketing
activities of Split Rock Energy, and had $36.1 million in outstanding support at
June 30, 2002 ($36.0 million at December 31, 2001).

SECURITIES.  In March 2001  ALLETE,  ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE  Capital III,
jointly filed a  registration  statement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement,  which has been declared
effective by the SEC, relates to the possible issuance of an aggregate amount of
$500 million of securities which may include ALLETE common stock, first mortgage
bonds and other debt  securities,  and ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE Capital III
preferred  trust  securities,   of  which  approximately  $387  million  remains
available to be issued.  ALLETE also previously filed a registration  statement,
which has been declared  effective by the SEC, relating to the possible issuance
of $25 million of first  mortgage bonds and other debt  securities.  We may sell
all or a portion of the remaining  registered  securities if warranted by market
conditions  and our  capital  requirements.  Any  offer  and  sale of the  above
mentioned  securities  will be made only by means of a  prospectus  meeting  the
requirements  of the  Securities  Act of 1933  and  the  rules  and  regulations
thereunder.

INVESTMENTS.  As  investments  in emerging  technology  companies  are sold,  we
recognize a gain or loss.  Our investment in the companies that have gone public
had a cost basis of approximately  $12 million at June 30, 2002 and December 31,
2001. The aggregate  market value of our  investment in these  companies at June
30, 2002 was $7 million  ($24 million at December  31,  2001).  At this time the
Company  does not believe  there is a permanent  impairment.  These  investments
provide us with access to developing technologies before their commercial debut,
as well as potential financial returns. We view these investments as a source of
capital for redeployment in existing businesses.


CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

As  a  result  of  new  construction  and  expansions  at  Automotive  Services,
consolidated  capital expenditures for 2002 are now expected to be $235 million.
Consolidated  capital  expenditures  for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 totaled
$97.5 million  ($78.3  million in 2001).  Expenditures  for 2002 included  $44.9
million  for  Energy  Services  and  $26.3  million  for  Automotive   Services.
Expenditures  for 2002 also  included  $26.3  million  related  to  discontinued
operations  ($22.4 million to maintain our Water Services  businesses while they
are in the process of being sold;  $3.9  million to buy  previously  leased auto
transportation  trucks).  Internally generated funds were the primary sources of
funding for these expenditures.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS  143,   "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement   Obligations,"   requires  the
recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in
which it is incurred.  When the  liability is initially  recorded,  the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time,
the  liability  is  accreted to its  present  value and the related  capitalized
charge is depreciated  over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective
for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  Currently,  decommissioning
amounts  collected  in  Minnesota  Power's  rates are  reported  in  accumulated
depreciation, which upon adoption of SFAS 143 will require a reclassification to
a  liability.  We are  reviewing  what  additional  assets,  if  any,  may  have
associated  retirement  costs as defined by SFAS 143 and  anticipate no material
impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

In July 2002 we began  liquidating our trading  securities  portfolio  through a
process we anticipate completing by the end of September 2002. With the proceeds
we plan to  reduce  our debt.  At June 30,  2002  available-for-sale  securities
consisted of the common stock of publicly traded companies and equity securities
in a grantor trust established to fund certain employee benefits.

Our trading securities  portfolio had a fair value of $157.2 million at June 30,
2002 ($155.6 million at December 31, 2001).  Our  available-for-sale  securities
portfolio had a fair value of $19.0  million at June 30, 2002 ($26.5  million at
December 31, 2001).


FOREIGN CURRENCY

Our foreign currency  exposure is limited to the conversion of operating results
of our  Canadian  subsidiaries  and,  therefore,  we have not  entered  into any
foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge the  conversion of our Canadian  operating
results into United States dollars.


POWER MARKETING

Minnesota Power purchases power for retail sales in our retail service territory
and occasionally  sells excess generation in the wholesale market. At the end of
second quarter of 2002 we also had 500 MW of merchant generation  (non-rate base
generation sold at market-based rates pursuant to FERC authority)  available for
sale to the wholesale market. Our merchant  generation  includes 225 MW from our
Taconite Harbor Energy Center in northern Minnesota that was acquired in October
2001. It also includes 275 MW of generation  secured  through a 15-year  tolling
agreement,  which  commenced in May 2002,  with NRG Energy at the Kendall County
facility near Chicago, Illinois. Under the Kendall County tolling agreement, the
Company pays a fixed capacity charge for the right,  but not the obligation,  to
utilize one 275 MW generating unit. We are responsible for arranging the natural
gas fuel supply and are entitled to the electricity produced. Our strategy is to
sell the majority of merchant  generation through long-term contracts of various
durations.  The  balance  will be sold in the spot  market,  through  short-term
agreements,  or  possibly  utilized  as a  source  of  low-cost  supply  for our
regulated  operations if the need exists.  The services of Split Rock Energy may
be utilized  to broker or market  merchant  generation.  We  currently  have two
long-term forward capacity and energy contracts related to generation secured by
the NRG Energy tolling  agreement.  Each is for 50 MW, with one having a 10-year
term and the other a 15-year term.

The services of Split Rock Energy are used to fulfill purchase  requirements for
retail  load and to market  excess  generation.  We own 50 percent of Split Rock
Energy which was formed in 2000 with Great River Energy to provide us with least
cost supply,  maximize the value of our generation assets and maximize marketing
revenue within  prescribed  limits.  Split Rock Energy operates in the wholesale
energy markets, and engages in marketing activities by entering into forward and
option  contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity.  These contracts are
primarily  short-term in nature with maturities of less than one year.  Although
Split Rock Energy generally attempts to balance its purchase and sale positions,
commodity  price risk  sometimes  exists or is  created.  This risk is  actively
managed through a risk management program that includes policies, procedures and
limits established by the Split Rock Energy Board of Governors.

Revenue for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2002 included $5.3 million
for  mark-to-market  income  attributable to the power  marketing  activities of
Split Rock Energy and our merchant  generation  operations ($1.5 million for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30,  2001).  Included in the $5.3  million of
mark-to-market  income in 2002 is $5.6  million  of  mark-to-market  income  for
future fixed margins associated with the Kendall County contracts.

In June 2002  Minnkota  received a Notice of  Violation  from the  Environmental
Protection  Agency (EPA) regarding  alleged New Source Review  violations at the
M.R.  Young Station which  includes the Square Butte  generating  unit.  The EPA
claims certain capital  projects  completed by Minnkota should have gone through
the New Source Review process potentially  resulting in new air permit operating
conditions.  The  Company  is unable to  predict  the  outcome  of this  matter.

         (e) For the purposes of this SECTION 1.4:

             (i)    if on any day the Outstanding Balance of any Pool Receivable
         is reduced or adjusted as a result of any discount, rebate or other
         adjustment made by the Originator, Seller or Servicer, or any setoff or

             (iv)   if and to the extent any Purchaser Agent, the Agent,
         [  *  ] or any Purchaser shall be required for any reason to pay over
         to an Obligor (or any trustee, receiver, custodian or similar official
         in any Insolvency Proceeding) any amount received by it hereunder, such
         amount shall be deemed not to have been so received but rather to have

         Agent, [  *  ] or such Purchaser, as the case may be, shall have a
         claim against the Seller for such amount, payable when and to the
         extent that any distribution from or on behalf of such Obligor is made

Investment of the Participations), the Seller may do so as follows:

             (i)    the Seller shall give each Purchaser Agent, [  *  ] and
         the Agent at least two Business Days' prior written notice thereof

         on which such reduction will commence),

             (ii)   on the proposed date of commencement of such reduction and
         on each day thereafter, the Servicer shall cause each Revolving
         Purchaser's Distribution Percentages of the remainder of the

         effect to SECTION 1.4(b)(i), SECTION 1.4(b)(ii)(A) and SECTION 1.4(g))
         to be transferred to the Liquidation Account and the Agent shall hold
         therein such amounts until the aggregate amount thereof not so
         reinvested shall equal the desired amount of reduction, and

             (iii)  the Agent shall hold such Collections in the Liquidation
         Account for the benefit of the Revolving Purchasers, and for payment to
         each Revolving Purchaser on a pari passu basis on the next Settlement
         Date relating to any Portion of the Investment of such Revolving
         Purchaser [  *  ] pursuant to SECTION 1.4(c)(ii) or (iii);

provided that,

              A.    unless otherwise agreed by the Agent the amount of any such
         reduction with respect to each Purchaser shall be not less than
         $1,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $100,000, and the

         such reduction shall be not less than $2,000,000,

             B.     the Seller shall use reasonable efforts to choose a
         reduction amount, and the date of commencement thereof, so that to the
         extent practicable such reduction shall commence and conclude in the
         same Yield Period, and

             C.     if two or more Portions of Investment shall be outstanding
         with respect to any Purchaser at the time of any proposed reduction,
         such proposed reduction shall be applied, unless the Seller shall
         otherwise specify in the notice given pursuant to SECTION 1.4(f)(i), to

day that is not a Termination Day from (i) the occurrence of the first Purchaser
Termination Day with respect to such Purchaser or (ii), to the extent a
Termination Date has occurred after the date in CLAUSE (i) hereof, the first
Business Day after such Termination Date that is not a Termination Day, in each
case until the date such Purchaser's Investment shall be paid in full. To the
extent that amounts have been transferred to the Liquidation Account pursuant to
this SECTION 1.4(g) but not distributed to the applicable Purchaser [ * ] prior
to the occurrence of a Termination Date, the Agent shall hold each Purchaser's
Termination Share of such amounts for distribution to such Purchaser pursuant to
SECTION 1.4(c)(iii) until the first day that is not a Termination Day, at which
time the Agent shall hold any such amounts for the benefit of the Purchaser
whose Purchaser Termination Day preceded the occurrence of the most recent
Termination Date (or, if the Investment of such Purchaser has been reduced to
zero, the Agent shall transfer such amounts to the Seller for reinvestment
pursuant to SECTION 1.4(b)(ii)(E)).

         (h) On each Revolving Paydown Day that is not also a Termination Day,
the remainder of the Collections represented by the Aggregate Participation

Revolving Paydown Day, at which point the Agent shall transfer such funds from
the Liquidation Account to the Seller, who shall reinvest such funds pursuant to
SECTION 1.4(b)(ii)(E) to the maximum extent permitted under this Agreement, (ii)

benefit of the Revolving Purchasers pursuant to this SECTION 1.4(h) or, if such
day is also not a Revolving Paydown Day, reinvested pursuant to CLAUSE (i) of
this SECTION 1.4(h)) and (iii) the first Settlement Date related to the end of
the Yield Period with respect to any Portion of Investment of a Revolving

Liquidation Account to make in full the distributions required under ITEM SECOND
of CLAUSE (i) of SECTION 1.4(c) or ITEM THIRD of CLAUSE (iii) of SECTION 1.4(c)

used by the Seller to acquire Receivables, the Seller shall deposit into the
Liquidation Account on or before such Draw Date the lesser of the amounts
described in CLAUSES (A) and (B) above for the benefit of the applicable
Purchasers. If on any Draw Date insufficient funds are on deposit in the
Liquidation Account (after giving effect to any deposits made by the Seller as
described in the preceding sentence) to make in full the distributions required

of SECTION 1.4(c) for such Draw Date, the Agent shall distribute funds from the
Cash Reserve Account pursuant to ITEM SECOND of CLAUSE (i) of SECTION 1.4(c) and
ITEM THIRD of CLAUSE (iii) of SECTION 1.4(c) as if such funds were funds on

Purchaser Agent, and consented to by the Insurer, in contemplation of the
applicable Purchaser becoming an additional party hereto (each such letter, as

determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the
existence of any commitment to make purchases of or otherwise to maintain the

the Pool Receivables; PROVIDED that within 30 days of an Affected Person's
knowledge of any such circumstance such Affected Person shall notify the Seller
in writing of the same and whether such Affected Person will request that the

purchasing, or maintaining the ownership of the related Participation(s) in

such Affected Person shall notify the Seller in writing of the same and whether
such Affected Person will request that the Seller indemnify it for such
circumstance. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Seller, the
Insurer, the Agent and the applicable Purchaser Agent (if any), by such Affected
Person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

each Yield Period in respect of which Discount is computed by reference to the
Eurodollar Rate, for such Yield Period, at a rate per annum equal at all times
during such Yield Period to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the
Eurodollar Rate for such Yield Period from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing
such Eurodollar Rate referred to in clause (i) above by that percentage equal to
100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage for such Yield Period, payable
on each date on which Discount is payable on the applicable Portion of
Investment; PROVIDED that within 30 days of an Affected Person's knowledge of
any such circumstance such Affected Person shall notify the Seller of the same
and whether such Affected Person will request that the Seller indemnify it for
such circumstance. Such additional Discount shall be determined by the Affected
Person and notified to the Seller through such Affected Person (or its Purchaser
Agent or the Agent) within 30 days after any Discount payment is made with
respect to which such additional Discount is requested. A certificate as to such
additional Discount submitted to the

                                       13

Seller by the Affected Person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

         Section 1.10. REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. In the event that any Affected
Person determines that the existence of or compliance with (i) any law or
regulation or any change therein or in the interpretation or application
thereof, in each case adopted, issued or occurring after the date hereof or (ii)
any request, guideline or directive from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority (whether or not having the force of law) issued or occurring after the
date of this Agreement:

             (i)    does or shall subject such Affected Person to any tax of any
         kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any increase in the
         applicable Participation(s) or in the amount of Investment relating
         thereto, or does or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to
         such Affected Person on account of Collections, Discount or any other
         amounts payable hereunder (excluding taxes imposed on the overall net
         income of such Affected Person, and franchise taxes imposed on such
         Affected Person, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such
         Affected Person is organized or a political subdivision thereof);

             (ii)   does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
         purchases, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any
         other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Affected Person which
         are not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate
         or the Base Rate hereunder; or

             (iii)  does or shall impose on such Affected Person any other
         condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is (x) to increase the cost to such
Affected Person of acting as a Purchaser Agent, Insurer or Agent or of agreeing
to purchase or purchasing or maintaining the ownership of undivided ownership
interests with regard to the applicable Participation or any Portion of
Investment (or interests therein) in respect of which Discount is computed by
reference to the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate or (y) to reduce any amount
receivable hereunder (whether directly or indirectly) funded or maintained by
reference to the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate, then, in any such case, upon
written demand by such Affected Person the Seller shall pay such Affected Person
any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Affected Person for such
additional cost or reduced amount receivable. All such amounts shall be payable
as incurred. A certificate from such Affected Person to the Seller certifying,
in reasonably specific detail, the basis for, calculation of, and amount of such
additional costs or reduced amount receivable shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error; PROVIDED, however, that no Affected Person shall be required
to disclose any confidential or tax planning information in any such
certificate.

         Section 1.11. INABILITY TO DETERMINE EURODOLLAR RATE. In the event that
any Purchaser Agent shall have determined prior to the first day of any Yield
Period for the Participation of its Purchaser (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto) by reason of circumstances
affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, either (a) dollar deposits in the
relevant amounts and for the relevant Yield Period are not available, (b)
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate
for such Yield Period or (c) the Eurodollar Rate determined pursuant hereto does
not accurately reflect the cost (as conclusively determined by such Purchaser
Agent) to any Purchaser for which such Purchaser Agent acts as agent of
maintaining each such Portion of Investment of such Purchaser during such Yield
Period, such Purchaser Agent shall promptly give telephonic notice of such
determination, confirmed in writing, to the Seller and the Insurer prior to the
first day of such Yield Period. Upon delivery of such notice (a) no Portion of
Investment of such Purchaser shall be funded thereafter at the Bank Rate
determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, unless and until the applicable
Purchaser Agent shall have given notice to the Seller that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exist, and (b) with respect to any
outstanding Portions of Investment then funded at the Bank Rate determined by
reference to the Eurodollar Rate, such Bank Rate shall automatically be
converted to the Bank Rate determined by reference to the Base Rate at the
respective last days of the then-current Yield Periods relating to such Portions
of Investment.

         Section 1.12. ADDITIONAL AND REPLACEMENT PURCHASERS, INCREASE IN
REVOLVING PURCHASE LIMIT. (a) The Seller shall have the right, at any time and
from time to time, with the prior written consent of the Agent and the Insurer
(the consent of the Insurer not to be unreasonably withheld), to add any entity
as a Purchaser hereunder (which addition may increase the Revolving Purchase
Limit if a Revolving Purchaser is added) or increase the Maximum Purchase Amount
of any existing Revolving Purchaser. Each such addition of a new Purchaser
hereunder shall be effected by delivery to the Insurer, the Seller, the
Servicer, the Agent and each Purchaser Agent, of a (i) Joinder Agreement
executed by the Seller, the Servicer, the Agent, such new Purchaser, its
Purchaser Agent (if different from the Purchaser) and the Insurer in
substantially the form of ANNEX D hereto and (ii) in the case of any new
Purchaser that is a Term Purchaser an opinion of counsel to such new Term
Purchaser as to tax matters in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Insurer.
Upon receipt of a Joinder Agreement, if such Joinder Agreement has been fully
executed and completed and is substantially in the form of ANNEX D, the Servicer
shall, not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the effectiveness of such
Joinder Agreement give prompt written notice to all Purchaser Agents, the Agent,
the Insurer and Purchasers as to (i) the name, identity and address for
receiving notices of the new Purchaser(s) and Purchaser Agent(s) becoming party
hereto, (ii) the Maximum Purchase Amount (if such Purchaser is a Revolving
Purchaser) of such new Purchaser, (iii) the change in the Revolving Purchase
Limit (if any) and (iv) the effective date of such Joinder Agreement.
Immediately upon the effectiveness of such Joinder Agreement, such additional
Purchaser shall purchase, by wire transfer of immediately available funds its
Participation and, if such Purchasers shall agree, a portion of the other
Purchasers' outstanding Portion of Investment. Effective with the payment of
such

                                       15
<PAGE>

amounts, such new Purchaser and its Purchaser Agent designated in the applicable
Joinder Agreement shall each become parties hereto.

         (b) By executing and delivering a Joinder Agreement, each new Purchaser
and Purchaser Agent confirms to and agrees with the Insurer, the Agent and each
other Purchaser and Purchaser Agent party hereto as follows: (A) such new
Purchaser has received a copy of this Agreement, the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, the Insurance Agreement, and the Policy, together with copies of such
financial statements and other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Joinder Agreement; (B) such new Purchaser has made and will continue to make,
independently and without reliance upon the Insurer, the Agent, any Purchaser
Agent or any other Purchaser and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, its own credit decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement; (C) such new Purchaser appoints and
authorizes the Control Party, Insurer and the Agent to take such action as agent
on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated
to the Control Party, Insurer and the Agent by the terms hereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (D) such new Purchaser and
its Purchaser Agent agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms
all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be
performed by it as a Purchaser or Purchaser Agent.

         (c) In addition to the foregoing, in the event that any Purchaser or
Purchaser Agent (i) does not consent to an amendment of clause (ii) of the
definition of Termination Date to which the Seller, the Servicer and the Insurer
have otherwise consented; or (ii) does not consent to any amendment or
modification of this Agreement agreed to by the Seller, the Servicer, the Agent
and the Control Party and the Majority Purchasers but which requires the consent
of such Purchaser, then, in any such event, the Seller shall have the right,
with the prior written consent of the Control Party and the Agent, to require
such Purchaser to assign its interests in its Participation and the Pool
Receivables and all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a
replacement Purchaser acceptable to the Control Party, the Agent and the Seller.
Any such assignment shall be without recourse, representation or warranty of any
kind on the part of the assigning Purchaser, except that such assignment is free
and clear of any Adverse Claims created by such Purchaser, and shall be
consummated pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the assignor
and assignee on not less than ten days' prior written notice, at a purchase
price equal to the sum of (w) the aggregate outstanding Investment of the
Purchaser being so replaced; (x) all accrued and unpaid Discount on such
Investment; (y) all accrued and unpaid Program Fees owed to or on behalf of such
Purchaser; and (z) all other accrued and unpaid expenses, indemnities and other
amounts owing under this Agreement to such Purchaser, including any Termination
Fees caused by the above-described assignment. Concurrently with any such
assignment, the Seller, the Servicer, such replacement Purchaser, its Purchaser
Agent (if different from the Purchaser) and the Insurer shall execute a Joinder
Agreement to evidence the terms and conditions under which such replacement
Purchaser has agreed to become a Purchaser hereunder.

expenses, losses and liabilities (including Attorney Costs) (all of the
foregoing being collectively referred to as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS") arising out
of or resulting from this Agreement or other Transaction Documents (whether
directly or indirectly) or the use of proceeds of purchases or reinvestments or

other acts or omissions of an Indemnified Party, excluding, however, (a)
Indemnified Amounts to the extent resulting from gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party, (b) recourse (except as

Amounts relating to or resulting from any of the following:

             (i)    the failure of any Receivable included in the calculation

         If for any reason the indemnification provided above in this SECTION
3.1 is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold such
Indemnified Party harmless, then the Seller shall contribute to such Indemnified

         Purchaser Agent with respect to Receivables or this Agreement to be
         true and correct;

             (ii)   any representation or warranty made by AFC under or in
         connection with any Transaction Document in its capacity as Servicer or
         any information or report delivered by or on behalf of AFC in its
         capacity as Servicer pursuant hereto, which shall have been false,
         incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed
         made;

         in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of any
         Receivable in, or purporting to be in, the Receivables Pool resulting
         from or relating to collection activities with respect to such
         Receivable (if such collection activities were performed by the Seller
         or any of its Affiliates acting as Servicer or by any agent or
         independent contractor retained by the Seller or any of its
         Affiliates);

         time with other funds; or

             (vii)  any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to AFC's
         activities as Servicer under this Agreement.

         If for any reason the indemnification provided above in this SECTION
3.2 is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold such
Indemnified Party harmless, then AFC shall contribute to such Indemnified Party
the amount otherwise payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss,

                                   ARTICLE IV.

                         ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTIONS

         Section IV.1. APPOINTMENT OF SERVICER. (a) The servicing, administering
and collection of the Pool Receivables shall be conducted by the Person so
designated from time to time as Servicer in accordance with this SECTION 4.1.
Until the Control Party gives notice to the Seller, the Insurer and the Servicer
(in accordance with this SECTION 4.1) of the designation of a new Servicer, AFC
is hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations
of, the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon the occurrence of a
Termination Event, the Control Party may designate as Servicer any Person
(including the Agent) to succeed the Servicer or any successor Servicer, on the
condition in each case that any such Person so designated shall agree to perform
the duties and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof.

                                       22

<PAGE>

         (b) Upon the designation of a successor Servicer as set forth in
SECTION 4.1(a) hereof, the Servicer agrees that it will terminate its activities
as Servicer hereunder in a manner which the Control Party determines will
facilitate the transition of the performance of such activities to the new
Servicer, and the Servicer shall cooperate with and assist such new Servicer.
Such cooperation shall include (without limitation) access to and transfer of
records and use by the new Servicer of all licenses, hardware or software
necessary or desirable to collect the Pool Receivables and the Related Security.

         (c) The Servicer acknowledges that, in making its decision to execute
and deliver this Agreement, the Purchaser Agents, the Agent, the Insurer and the
Purchasers have relied on the Servicer's agreement to act as Servicer hereunder.
Accordingly, the Servicer agrees that it will not voluntarily resign as
Servicer.

         (d) The Servicer may delegate its duties and obligations hereunder to
any subservicer (each, a "SUB-SERVICER"); provided that, in each such
delegation, (i) such Sub-Servicer shall agree in writing to perform the duties
and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof, (ii) the Servicer
shall remain primarily liable to the Purchasers, the Insurer, the Agent and the
Purchaser Agents for the performance of the duties and obligations so delegated,
(iii) the Seller, the Purchaser Agents, the Agent, the Insurer and the
Purchasers shall have the right to look solely to the Servicer for such
performance and (iv) the terms of any agreement with any Sub-Servicer shall

further, no such delegation shall be effective without the prior written consent
of the Control Party.

         Section 4.2. DUTIES OF SERVICER. (a) The Servicer shall take or cause

         (a) DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. On or prior to the date hereof, the Servicer
agrees to transfer ownership and control of each Deposit Account to the Seller.

         (b) CASH RESERVE ACCOUNT. The Agent agrees to establish the Cash

Receivables prior to the applicable Settlement Dates and for such other purposes
described in the Transaction Documents. No funds other than those transferred in
accordance with SECTION 1.4 shall be intentionally transferred into the
Liquidation Account.

         (d) PERMITTED INVESTMENTS. Any amounts in the Liquidation Account or
the Cash Reserve Account, as the case may be, may be invested by the Liquidation
Account Bank or the Cash Reserve Account Bank, respectively, at the Agent's
direction, in Permitted Investments, so long as the Agent's interest (for the
benefit of the Secured Parties) in such Permitted Investments is perfected in a
manner satisfactory to the Agent and the Insurer and such Permitted Investments
are subject to no Adverse Claims other than those of the Agent provided
hereunder.

         (e) CONTROL OF ACCOUNTS. The Agent may (with notice to the Control
Party) and shall (at the direction of the Control Party) following any
Termination Event (or an Unmatured Termination Event of the type described in
PARAGRAPH (g) of EXHIBIT V) at any time give notice to any Deposit Account Bank
that the Agent is exercising its rights under the applicable Deposit Account
Agreement to do any or all of the following: (i) to have the exclusive ownership
and control of such Deposit Account transferred to the Agent and to exercise
exclusive dominion and control over the funds deposited therein and (ii) to take
any or all other actions permitted under the applicable Deposit Account
Agreement. The Seller hereby agrees that if the Agent at any time takes any
action set forth in the preceding sentence, the Agent shall have exclusive
control of the proceeds (including Collections) of all Pool Receivables and the
Seller hereby further agrees to take any other action that the Agent may

         that payment of all amounts payable under any Pool Receivable be made
         directly to the Agent or its designee (for the benefit of the Secured
         Parties);

             (ii)   the Control Party may (and if the Control Party is the
         Majority Purchasers, with the consent of the Agent) instruct the Seller
         or the Servicer to give notice of the Agent's interest (for the benefit
         of the Secured Parties) in Pool Receivables to each Obligor, which
         notice shall direct that payments be made directly to the Agent or its
         designee (for the benefit of the Secured Parties), and upon such
         instruction from the Control Party, the Seller or the Servicer, as
         applicable, shall give such notice at the expense of the Seller;
         PROVIDED, that if the Seller or the Servicer fails to so notify each
         Obligor, the Control Party or the Agent may so notify the Obligors; and

             (iii)  the Control Party may (and if the Control Party is the
         Majority Purchasers, with the consent of the Agent) request the Seller
         or the Servicer to, and upon such request the Seller or the Servicer,
         as applicable, shall, (A) assemble all of the records necessary or
         desirable to collect the Pool Receivables and the Related Security, and

         Security, and make the same available to the Agent or its designee at a
         place selected by the Control Party (or if the Control Party is the
         Majority Purchasers, the Agent) and (B) segregate all cash, checks and
         other instruments received by it from time to time constituting
         Collections with respect to the Pool Receivables in a manner acceptable
         to the Control Party (or if the Control Party is the Majority
         Purchasers, the Agent) and, promptly upon receipt, remit all such cash,
         checks and instruments, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments
         of transfer, to the Agent or its designee (for the benefit of the
         Secured Parties).

         (b) The Seller hereby authorizes the Control Party (or if the Control
Party is the Majority Purchasers, the Agent) (for the benefit of the Secured
Parties), and irrevocably appoints the Control Party (or if the Control Party is
the Majority Purchasers, the Agent) (acting on behalf of the Secured Parties) as
its attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution and with full authority in
the place and stead of the Seller, which appointment is coupled with an
interest, to take any and all steps in the name of the Seller and on behalf of
the Seller necessary or desirable, in the determination of the Control Party (or
if the Control Party is the Majority Purchasers, the Agent), to collect any and
all amounts or portions thereof due under any and all Pool Receivables or
Related Security, including, without limitation, endorsing the name of the
Seller on checks and other instruments representing Collections and enforcing
such Pool Receivables, Related Security and the related Contracts. The Control
Party (or if the Control Party is the Majority Purchasers, the Agent) shall only
exercise the powers conferred by this SUBSECTION (b) after the occurrence of a
Termination Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
SUBSECTION (b), none of the powers conferred upon such attorney-in-fact pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence shall subject such attorney-in-fact to any
liability if any action taken by it shall prove to be inadequate or invalid, nor
shall they confer any obligations upon such attorney-in-fact in any manner
whatsoever.

         Section 4.5. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SELLER. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Seller shall (i) perform all of its obligations,
if any, under the Contracts related to the Pool Receivables to the same extent
as if interests in such Pool Receivables had not been transferred hereunder, and
the exercise by the Agent, the Insurer, any Purchaser or any Purchaser Agent of
its rights hereunder shall not relieve the Seller from such obligations and (ii)
pay when due any taxes, including, without limitation, any sales taxes payable
in connection with the Pool Receivables and their creation and satisfaction. The
Agent, the Insurer, the Purchaser Agents and the Purchasers shall not have any
obligation or liability with respect to any Pool Receivable, any Related
Security or any related Contract, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform
any of the obligations of the Seller or AFC under any of the foregoing.

         Section 4.6. SERVICING FEE. The Servicer shall be paid a fee, through
distributions contemplated by SECTION 1.4, equal to (a) at any time AFC or an
Affiliate of AFC is the Servicer, [  *  ] and (b) at any time a Person other

(a) above or such other amount as the Control Party and such Servicer shall
agree. The Servicing Fee shall not be payable to the extent funds are not
available to pay the Servicing Fee pursuant to SECTION 1.4.

         Section V.1. APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION. The Insurer and each
Purchaser and Purchaser Agent (including each Purchaser and Purchaser Agent that
may from time to time become a party hereto) hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp. the "Agent" hereunder and authorizes the Agent
to take such actions and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent
hereby and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall hold, in its name, for the benefit of the Secured Parties,

Agent shall not have any duties other than those expressly set forth herein or
any fiduciary relationship with any Indemnified Party, and no implied
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or otherwise exist, against the Agent. The Agent does not
assume, nor shall it be deemed to have assumed, any obligation to, or
relationship of trust or agency with, the Seller or Servicer. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to the
contrary, in no event shall the Agent ever be required to take any action which
exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to the provision of
any Transaction Document or applicable law.

         (a) Each Purchaser hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the
respective institution identified as the Purchaser Agent for such Purchaser on
the signature pages hereto or in any agreement pursuant to which such Purchaser
becomes a party hereto, and each authorizes such Purchaser Agent to take such
action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to such Purchaser
Agent by the terms of this Agreement, if any, together with such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no Purchaser Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with the Insurer, any Purchaser or other Purchaser Agent or the
Agent, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities on the part of such Purchaser Agent shall be read
into this Agreement or otherwise exist against such Purchaser Agent.

         (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the
provisions of this ARTICLE V are solely for the benefit of the Purchaser Agents,
the Insurer, the Agent and the Purchasers, and none of the Seller or Servicer
shall have any rights as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise under any of the
provisions of this ARTICLE V, except that this ARTICLE V shall not affect any
obligations which any Purchaser Agent, the Insurer, the Agent or any Purchaser
may have to the Seller or the Servicer under the other provisions of this
Agreement. Furthermore, no Purchaser shall have any rights as a third-party
beneficiary or otherwise under any of the provisions hereof in respect of a
Purchaser Agent which is not the Purchaser Agent for such Purchaser.

         (c) In performing its functions and duties hereunder, the Agent shall
act solely as the agent of the Secured Parties, and the Agent does not assume
nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or
agency with or for the Seller or Servicer or any of their successors and
assigns. In performing its functions and duties hereunder, each Purchaser

                                       27

<PAGE>

Agent shall act solely as the agent of its respective Purchasers and does not
assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of
trust or agency with or for the Seller, the Servicer, the Insurer, any other
Purchaser, any other Purchaser Agent or the Agent, or any of their respective
successors and assigns.

         Section 5.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may, with the prior
written consent of the Control Party, execute any of its duties through agents
or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible to the
Purchaser Agents, the Insurer or any Purchaser for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

         Section 5.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. None of the Purchaser Agents, the
Agent or any of their directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable
for any action taken or omitted (i) with the consent or at the direction of the
Control Party (or in the case of any Purchaser Agent, the Purchaser relating to
such Purchaser Agent) or (ii) in the absence of such Person's gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Agent shall not be responsible to any Purchaser, the
Insurer or Purchaser Agent for (i) any recitals, representations, warranties or
other statements made by the Seller, Servicer, the Originator or any of their
Affiliates, (ii) the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of any Transaction Document, (iii) any failure of the Seller, the
Servicer, the Originator or any of their Affiliates to perform any obligation it
may have under any Transaction Document to which it is a party or (iv) the
satisfaction of any condition specified in EXHIBIT II. The Agent shall not have
any obligation to the Insurer, any Purchaser or any Purchaser Agent to ascertain
or inquire about the observance or performance of any agreement contained in any
Transaction Document or to inspect the properties, books or records of the
Seller, Servicer, the Originator or any of their Affiliates.

         Section 5.4. RELIANCE BY AGENTS. Each Purchaser Agent and the Agent
shall in all cases be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any document or other writing or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Seller, Insurer
or Servicer), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent or
any such Purchaser Agent. Each Purchaser Agent and the Agent shall in all cases
be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any
Transaction Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Control Party (or in the case of any Purchaser Agent, the Purchaser relating
to such Purchaser Agent) and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction
by the Control Party against any and all liability and expense which may be
incurred by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

         (a) With regard to the Purchasers and the Purchaser Agents, the Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Control Party, the
Insurer, the Purchasers and the Purchaser Agents, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all
Purchasers, the Insurer, the Agent and Purchaser Agents.

                                       28
<PAGE>

         (b) Purchasers that have a common Purchaser Agent and that have a
majority of the Investment of all such related Purchasers shall be entitled to
request or direct the related Purchaser Agent to take action, or refrain from
taking action, under this Agreement on behalf of such Purchasers. With regard to
the Purchasers and the Purchaser Agents, such Purchaser Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
in accordance with a request of such Majority Purchasers, and such request and
any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of
such Purchaser Agent's related Purchasers.

         (c) Unless otherwise advised in writing by a Purchaser Agent or by any
Purchaser on whose behalf such Purchaser Agent is purportedly acting, each party
to this Agreement may assume that (i) such Purchaser Agent is acting for the
benefit of each of the Purchasers for which such Purchaser Agent is identified
herein (or in any Joinder Agreement or assignment agreement) as being the
Purchaser Agent, as well as for the benefit of each assignee or other transferee
from any such Person, and (ii) each action taken by such Purchaser Agent has
been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action on the part of the
Purchasers on whose behalf it is purportedly acting. Each Purchaser Agent and
its Purchaser(s) shall agree amongst themselves as to the circumstances and
procedures for removal, resignation and replacement of such Purchaser Agent.

         Section 5.5. NOTICE OF TERMINATION DATE. Neither any Purchaser Agent
nor the Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of
any Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event unless such Person has
received notice from any Purchaser, Purchaser Agent, the Insurer, the Servicer
or the Seller stating that a Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event
has occurred hereunder and describing such Termination Event or Unmatured
Termination Event. If the Agent receives such a notice, it shall promptly give
notice thereof to the Insurer and each Purchaser Agent whereupon each such
Purchaser Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to its Purchasers. If a
Purchaser Agent receives such a notice (other than from the Agent), it shall
promptly give notice thereof to the Agent. The Agent may take such action
concerning a Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event as may be directed
by the Control Party (unless the Control Party is the Majority Purchasers and
such action otherwise requires the consent of all Purchasers), but until the
Agent receives such directions (if the Control Party is the Majority
Purchasers), the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, as the Agent deems advisable and in the best
interests of the Secured Parties.

         Section 5.6. NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT, PURCHASER AGENTS AND OTHER
PURCHASERS. Each Purchaser and the Insurer expressly acknowledges that none of
the Agent, the Purchaser Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations
or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent, or any Purchaser Agent
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Seller, Servicer or
the Originator, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by
the Agent or such Purchaser Agent, as applicable. Each Purchaser and the Insurer
represents and warrants to the Agent and

                                       29

<PAGE>

the Purchaser Agents that, independently and without reliance upon the Agent,
Purchaser Agents or any other Purchaser and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, it has made and will continue to make
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of the Seller,
Servicer or the Originator, and the Receivables and its own decision to enter
into this Agreement and to take, or omit, action under any Transaction Document.
Except for items specifically required to be delivered hereunder, the Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Purchaser Agent with
any information concerning the Seller, Servicer or the Originator or any of
their Affiliates or the Receivables that comes into the possession of the Agent
or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates.

         Section 5.7. AGENT, PURCHASER AGENTS AND PURCHASERS. Each of the
Purchasers, the Agent, the Purchaser Agents and their Affiliates may extend
credit to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust, debt or other business with the Seller, ADESA, ALLETE, Servicer or the
Originator or any of their Affiliates. With respect to the acquisition of the
Eligible Receivables pursuant to this Agreement, any of the Purchaser Agents and
the Agent shall, to the extent they become Purchasers hereunder, have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any Purchaser and may exercise the
same as though it were not such an agent, and the terms "Purchaser" and
"Purchasers" shall, in such case, include such Purchaser Agent or the Agent in
their individual capacities.

         Section 5.8. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Agent (but solely in its capacity as Agent) and its officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Seller or Servicer and without limiting the obligation of the Seller or
Servicer to do so), ratably in accordance with their respective Investment from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
judgments, settlements, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind whatsoever
(including in connection with any investigative or threatened proceeding,
whether or not the Agent or such Person shall be designated a party thereto)
that may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent or
such Person as a result of, or related to, any of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents or the execution, delivery or performance of the
Transaction Documents or any other document furnished in connection therewith
(but excluding any such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
judgments, settlements, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or such Person as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction); PROVIDED, that in the
case of each Purchaser that is a commercial paper conduit, such indemnity shall
be provided solely to the extent of amounts received by such Purchaser under
this Agreement which exceed the amounts required to repay such Purchaser's
outstanding commercial paper. The obligations of any Note Issuer under this
SECTION 5.8 shall be subject to the restrictions of SECTION 6.5.

<PAGE>

         Section 5.9. SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may, upon at least thirty (30)
days notice to the Seller, the Insurer and each Purchaser and Purchaser Agent,
resign as Agent. Such resignation shall not become effective until a successor
Agent is appointed by the Control Party and has accepted such appointment. Upon
such acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights and
duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents. After any retiring
Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of SECTIONS 3.1 and 3.2 and this
ARTICLE V shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was the Agent.

                                   ARTICLE VI.

         Section 6.1. AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Seller or Servicer
therefrom shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the Agent, the
Control Party, the Majority Purchasers, and, in the case of any amendment, by
the Seller and the Servicer and then such amendment, waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amendment or waiver shall materially
adversely affect the Insurer without the prior written consent of the Insurer;
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that (i) other than an amendment to extend the scheduled
Termination Date and/or the applicable scheduled Purchaser Termination Date, no
amendment shall be effective unless each Note Issuer that is a Purchaser (or the
Agent or applicable Purchaser Agent on its behalf) shall have received written
confirmation by the Rating Agencies that such amendment shall not cause the
rating on the then outstanding Notes of such Note Issuer to be downgraded or
withdrawn; (ii) no amendment shall be effective which would reduce the amount of
Investment or Discount, or fees payable to any Purchaser or amounts payable to
the Insurer hereunder, or delay any scheduled date for payment thereof
(including any scheduled occurrence of the Termination Date) absent the prior
written consent of the Insurer or such Purchaser (as applicable); (iii) no

Receivables may be modified without the prior written consent of the Insurer;

Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA) exists with

completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely
preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. No such
Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.

               (viii) promptly after the Seller obtains knowledge thereof,
               notice of any (a) litigation, investigation or proceeding which
               may exist at any time between the Seller, the Servicer or the
               Originator, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
               which, if not cured or if adversely determined, as the case may
               be,

               would have a Material Adverse Effect, or (b) litigation or
               proceeding adversely affecting the Seller or any of its
               subsidiaries, the Servicer or the Originator, as the case may be,
               in which the amount involved, in the case of the Servicer or
               Originator, is $100,000 or more and not covered by insurance or
               in which injunctive or similar relief is sought or (c) litigation
               or proceeding relating to any Transaction Document;

               (ix)   promptly after the occurrence thereof, notice of any event
               or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to have a
               Material Adverse Effect;

               (x)    notice of any material change to the Credit and Collection
               Policy; and

               (xi) as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days after
               the Seller knows or has reason to know of: (i) the occurrence or
               expected occurrence of any Reportable Event with respect to any
               Plan that is a Single Employer Plan, a failure to make any
               required contribution to a Plan, the creation of any lien in
               favor of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or a Plan or
               any withdrawal from, or the termination, Reorganization or
               Insolvency of, any Multiemployer Plan or (ii) the institution of

               or any Multiemployer Plan with respect to the withdrawal from, or
               the terminating, Reorganization or Insolvency of any Plan.

         (m)   SEPARATE CORPORATE EXISTENCE. Each of the Seller and the Servicer
hereby acknowledges that the Purchasers, the Insurer, the Agent and the
Purchaser Agents are entering into the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and the Transaction Documents in reliance upon the Seller's identity
as a legal entity separate from the Servicer and the Originator. Therefore, from
and after the date hereof, the Seller and the Servicer shall take all reasonable
steps to continue the Seller's identity as a separate legal entity and to make
it apparent to third Persons that the Seller is an entity with assets and
liabilities distinct from those of the Servicer, the Originator and any other
Person, and is not a division of the Servicer or the Originator or any other
Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to and
consistent with the covenant set forth in PARAGRAPH (a) of this EXHIBIT IV, the
Seller and the Servicer shall take such actions as shall be required in order
that:

                      (i)    The Seller will be a limited purpose corporation
         whose primary activities are restricted in its articles of
         incorporation to purchasing Receivables from the Originator, entering
         into agreements for the servicing of such Receivables, selling
         undivided interests in such Receivables and conducting such other
         activities as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its
         primary activities;

                      (ii)   Not less than one member of Seller's Board of
         Directors (the "INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS") shall be individuals who are
         not direct, indirect or beneficial

                                                           [Amended and Restated
                                      IV-5       Receivables Purchase Agreement]

         stockholders, officers, directors, employees, affiliates, associates,
         customers or suppliers of the Originator or any of its Affiliates. The
         Seller's Board of Directors shall not approve, or take any other action
         to cause the commencement of a voluntary case or other proceeding with
         respect to the Seller under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, debt arrangement, dissolution or other similar law, or
         the appointment of or taking possession by, a receiver, liquidator,
         assignee, trustee, custodian, or other similar official for the Seller
         unless in each case the Independent Directors shall approve the taking
         of such action in writing prior to the taking of such action. The
         Independent Directors' fiduciary duty shall be to the Seller (and
         creditors) and not to the Seller's shareholders in respect of any
         decision of the type described in the preceding sentence. In the event
         an Independent Director resigns or otherwise ceases to be a director of
         the Seller, there shall be selected a replacement Independent Director
         who shall not be an individual within the proscriptions of the first
         sentence of this CLAUSE (ii) or any individual who has any other type
         of professional relationship with the Originator or any of its
         Affiliates or any management personnel of any such Person or Affiliate
         and who shall be (x) a tenured professor at a business or law school,
         (y) a retired judge or (z) an established independent member of the
         business community, having a sound reputation and experience relative
         to the duties to be performed by such individual as an Independent
         Director;

                      (iii)  No Independent Director shall at any time serve as
         a trustee in bankruptcy for Originator or any Affiliate thereof;

                      (iv)   Any employee, consultant or agent of the Seller
         will be compensated from the Seller's own bank accounts for services
         provided to the Seller except as provided herein in respect of the
         Servicing Fee. The Seller will engage no agents other than a Servicer
         for the Receivables, which Servicer will be fully compensated for its
         services to the Seller by payment of the Servicing Fee;

                      (v)    The Seller will contract with the Servicer to
         perform for the Seller all operations required on a daily basis to
         service its Receivables. The Seller will pay the Servicer a monthly fee
         based on the level of Receivables being managed by the Servicer. The
         Seller will not incur any material indirect or overhead expenses for
         items shared between the Seller and the Originator or any Affiliate
         thereof which are not reflected in the Servicing Fee. To the extent, if
         any, that the Seller and the Originator or any Affiliate thereof share
         items of expenses not reflected in the Servicing Fee, such as legal,
         auditing and other professional services, such expenses will be
         allocated to the extent practical on the basis of actual use or the
         value of services rendered, and otherwise on a basis reasonably related
         to the actual use or the value of services rendered, it being
         understood that Originator shall pay all expenses relating to the
         preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the Transaction
         Documents, including, without limitation, legal and other fees;

                                                           [Amended and Restated

                      (vi)   The Seller's operating expenses will not be paid by
         Originator or any Affiliate thereof unless the Seller shall have agreed
         in writing with such Person to reimburse such Person for any such
         payments;

                      (vii)  The Seller will have its own separate mailing
         address and stationery;

                      (viii) The Seller's books and records will be maintained
         separately from those of the Originator or any Affiliate thereof;

                      (ix)   Any financial statements of the Originator or ADESA
         which are consolidated to include the Seller will contain detailed
         notes clearly stating that the Seller is a separate corporate entity
         and has sold ownership interests in the Seller's accounts receivable;

                      (x)    The Seller's assets will be maintained in a manner
         that facilitates their identification and segregation from those of the
         Originator and any Affiliate thereof;

                      (xi)   The Seller will strictly observe corporate
         formalities in its dealings with the Originator and any Affiliate
         thereof, and funds or other assets of the Seller will not be commingled
         with those of the Originator or any Affiliate thereof. The Seller shall
         not maintain joint bank accounts or other depository accounts to which
         the Originator or any Affiliate thereof (other than AFC in its capacity
         as Servicer) has independent access and shall not pool any of the
         Seller's funds at any time with any funds of the Originator or any
         Affiliate thereof;

                      (xii)  The Seller shall pay to the Originator the marginal
         increase (or, in the absence of such increase, the market amount of its
         portion) of the premium payable with respect to any insurance policy
         that covers the Seller and any Affiliate thereof, but the Seller shall
         not, directly or indirectly, be named or enter into an agreement to be
         named, as a direct or contingent beneficiary or loss payee, under any
         such insurance policy, with respect to any amounts payable due to
         occurrences or events related to the Originator or any Affiliate
         thereof (other than the Seller); and

                      (xiii) The Seller will maintain arm's length relationships
         with the Originator and any Affiliate thereof. The Originator or any
         Affiliate thereof that renders or otherwise furnishes services to the
         Seller will be compensated by the Seller at market rates for such
         services. Neither the Seller nor the Originator or any Affiliate
         thereof will be or will hold itself out to be responsible for the debts
         of the other or the decisions or actions respecting the daily business
         and affairs of the other.

               (n)    MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, SALES, ETC.

                      (i)    The Seller shall not:

                                   EXHIBIT VII

              PERFECTION REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

         In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained
in the Agreement, to induce Purchasers and Agent to enter into the Agreement
and, in the case of Purchasers, to purchase the Participation hereunder, the
Seller hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Agent and the Purchasers as
to itself as follows on the Closing Date and on the date of each purchase and
reinvestment in the Participation thereafter:

                                     GENERAL

        1.      The Agreement creates a valid and continuing security interest
(as defined in the Indiana UCC) in the Receivables in favor of the Agent, for
the benefit of the Secured Parties, which security interest is prior to all
other Adverse Claims, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and
purchasers from the Seller.

        2.      The Receivables constitute "accounts," "payment intangibles,"
"general intangibles," "instruments" or "tangible chattel paper," within the
meaning of the Indiana UCC.

        3.      The Cash Reserve Account, the Deposit Account and the
Liquidation Account and all subaccounts of such accounts, constitute either a
"deposit account" or a "securities account" within the meaning of the Indiana
UCC.

        4.      Originator has taken all steps necessary to perfect its security
interest against the Obligors in the property securing the Receivables that
constitute chattel paper.

                                    CREATION

        5.      The Seller owns and has good and marketable title to the
Receivables free and clear of any Adverse Claim, claim or encumbrance of any
Person, excepting only Permitted Liens.

        6.      Originator has received all consents and approvals to the sale
of the Receivables hereunder to the Seller required by the terms of the
Receivables that constitute instruments or payment intangibles.

                                                           [Amended and Restated
                                     VII-1       Receivables Purchase Agreement]

                                   PERFECTION

        7.      Each of the Originator and the Seller has caused or will have
caused, [ * ] the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper
filing office in the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to
perfect the sale of the Receivables from Originator to the Seller pursuant to
the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the security interest therein granted by the
Seller to the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, hereunder; and
Originator has in its possession the original copies of such instruments or
tangible chattel paper that constitute or evidence the Receivables, and all
financing statements referred to in this paragraph contain a statement to the
effect that: A purchase of or security interest in any collateral described in
this financing statement will violate the rights of the Agent, for the benefit
of the Secured Parties.

        8.       With respect to Receivables that constitute an instrument or
tangible chattel paper:

                 Such instruments or tangible chattel paper is in the possession
                 of the Servicer and the Agent has received a written
                 acknowledgment from the Servicer that the Servicer is holding
                 such instruments or tangible chattel paper solely on behalf and
                 for the benefit of the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties,
                 and each of the Originator and the Seller has caused or will
                 have caused, [  *  ] the filing of all appropriate financing
                 statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
                 jurisdictions under applicable law, and all financing
                 statements referred to in this paragraph contain a statement
                 to the effect that: A purchase of or security interest in any
                 collateral described in this financing statement will violate
                 the rights of the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured
                 Parties.

        9.       With respect to the Cash Reserve Account, the Deposit Account
and the Liquidation Account and all subaccounts of such accounts that constitute
deposit accounts, either:

                 (i) The Seller has delivered to the Agent, for the benefit of
                 the Secured Parties, a fully executed agreement pursuant to
                 which the bank maintaining the deposit accounts has agreed to
                 comply with all instructions originated by the Agent, for the
                 benefit of the Secured Parties, directing disposition of the
                 funds in such accounts without further consent by the Seller;
                 or

                 (ii) The Seller has taken all steps necessary to cause the
                 Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, to become the account
                 holder of such accounts.

                                                           [Amended and Restated

* TEXT HAS BEEN OMITTED PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND HAS

<PAGE>


        10.      With respect to the Cash Reserve Account, the Deposit Account
and the Liquidation Account or subaccounts of such accounts that constitute
"securities accounts" or "securities entitlements" within the meaning of the
Indiana UCC:

                 (i) The Seller has delivered to the Agent, for the benefit of
                 the Secured Parties, a fully executed agreement pursuant to
                 which the securities intermediary has agreed to comply with all
                 instructions originated by the Agent, for the benefit of the
                 Secured Parties, relating to such account without further
                 consent by the Seller; or

                 (ii) The Seller has taken all steps necessary to cause the
                 securities intermediary to identify in its records the Agent,
                 for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as the person having a
                 security entitlement against the securities intermediary in
                 each of such accounts.


                                    PRIORITY

        11.      Other than the transfer of the Receivables to the Seller under
the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the security interest granted to the Agent,
for the benefit of the Secured Parties, pursuant to this Agreement, neither the
Seller nor the Originator has pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security
interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Receivables or the Cash Reserve
Account, the Deposit Account, the Liquidation Account or any subaccount of such
accounts. Neither the Seller nor the Originator has authorized the filing of, or
is aware of any financing statements against the Seller or the Originator that
include a description of collateral covering the Receivables or the Cash Reserve
Account, the Deposit Account, the Liquidation Account or any subaccount of such
accounts other than any financing statement relating to the security interest
granted to the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, hereunder or that
has been terminated.

        12.      Neither the Seller nor the Originator is aware of any judgment,
ERISA or tax lien filings against either the Seller or the Originator.

        13.      None of the instruments or tangible chattel paper that
constitute or evidence the Receivables has any marks or notations indicating
that they have been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed to any Person other
than the Seller or the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties.

        14.      Neither the Cash Reserve Account, the Deposit Account, the
Liquidation Account nor any subaccount of such accounts are in the name of any
person other than the Seller or the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties. The
Seller has not consented to the securities intermediary of any such account to
comply with entitlement orders of any person other than the Agent, on behalf of
the Secured Parties.

                                                           [Amended and Restated
                                     VII-3       Receivables Purchase Agreement]

<PAGE>


        15.      SURVIVAL OF PERFECTION REPRESENTATIONS. Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the
Perfection Representations contained in this Exhibit VII shall be continuing,
and remain in full force and effect (notwithstanding any termination of the
commitments or any replacement of the Servicer or termination of Servicer's
rights to act as such) until such time as Investments and all other obligations
under the Agreement have been finally and fully paid and performed.

        16.      NO WAIVER. The parties to the Agreement: (i) shall not, without
obtaining a confirmation of the then-current rating of the Notes, waive any of
the Perfection Representations; (ii) shall provide the Ratings Agencies with
prompt written notice of any breach of the Perfection Representations, and shall
not, without obtaining a confirmation of the then-current rating of the Notes
(as determined after any adjustment or withdrawal of the ratings following
notice of such breach) waive a breach of any of the Perfection Representations.

        17.      SERVICER TO MAINTAIN PERFECTION AND PRIORITY. The Servicer
covenants that, in order to evidence the interests of the Agent, on behalf of
the Secured Parties, under this Agreement, Servicer shall take such action, or
execute and deliver such instruments (other than effecting a Filing (as defined
below), unless such Filing is effected in accordance with this paragraph) as may
be necessary or advisable including, without limitation, such actions as are
requested by the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, to maintain and
perfect, as a first priority interest (subject only to Permitted Liens), the
Agent's, on behalf of the Secured Parties', security interest in the
Receivables, Related Security and Collections. Servicer shall, from time to time
and within the time limits established by law, prepare and present to the Agent,
on behalf of the Secured Parties, for the Agent, on behalf of the Secured
Parties, to authorize (based in reliance on the opinion of counsel hereinafter
provided for) the Servicer to file, all financing statements, amendments,
continuations, initial financing statements in lieu of a continuation statement,
terminations, partial terminations, releases or partial releases, or any other
filings necessary or advisable to continue, maintain and perfect the Agent's, on
behalf of the Secured Parties' security interest in the Receivables, Related
Security and Collections as a first-priority interest (subject only to Permitted
Liens) (each a "Filing"). Servicer shall present each such Filing to the Agent,
on behalf of the Secured Parties, together with (x) an opinion of counsel as to
perfection and such other matters as the Control Party (or if the Control Party
is the Majority Purchasers, the Agent) may reasonably request with respect to
such Filing, and (y) a form of authorization for the Agent's, on behalf of the
Secured Parties' signature. Upon receipt of such opinion of counsel and form of
authorization, the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, shall promptly
authorize in writing Servicer to, and Servicer shall, effect such Filing under
the Uniform Commercial Code without the signature of Originator, the Seller, or
the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties where allowed by applicable law.
Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement to the contrary, the Servicer
shall not have any authority to effect a Filing without obtaining written
authorization from the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, in accordance
with this paragraph (17).

                                                           [Amended and Restated

each  reference  to the  Original  Purchase  and  Sale  Agreement  in any  other

property  of the related  Obligor or any other  Person  directly  or  indirectly
liable for the  payment of any such  Receivable  that are (or are to be) applied

All purchases and contributions hereunder shall  be  made without  recourse, but

conditions set forth in this Agreement,  the Company agrees to make all Purchase
Price payments to the Originator.

         1.4.  PURCHASE  AND  SALE  TERMINATION  DATE. The  "PURCHASE  AND  SALE

Receivables)  and Related Rights (other than those  relating to the  Contributed
Receivables) by the Originator to the Company, as contemplated by this Agreement

Related Rights. If, however,  notwithstanding  the  intent of the  parties, such

to the  Receivables  and the Related Rights now existing and hereafter  created,
all monies due or to become due and all amounts  received with respect  thereto,

               "SOLVENT" means, with  respect  to  any  Person  at  any time,  a

               (C)   the "regular market value" of an asset shall be  the amount

                                   ARTICLE II

         (b) that were made during the period commencing on the Servicer  Report

                                   ARTICLE III

                          CONTRIBUTION OF RECEIVABLES;
                            PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE

         3.1.  CONTRIBUTION OF RECEIVABLES. On  the  Original  Closing Date, the
Originator  contributed to the capital of the Company,  Receivables  and Related
Rights with respect thereto consisting of each Receivable of the Originator that
existed and was owing to the Originator on the Original  Closing Date that as of
such date was not an Eligible  Receivable and Receivables  that existed and were
owing to the  Originator on the Original  Closing Date that as of such date were
Eligible Receivables, beginning with the oldest of such Eligible Receivables and
continuing  chronologically  thereafter, and all or an undivided interest in the
most recent of such  contributed  Eligible  Receivables  such that the aggregate
Outstanding Balance of all such contributed Receivables [  *  ].

         3.2.  INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENT. On  the  terms and subject to the
conditions  set  forth  in this  Agreement,  the  Company  agreed  to pay to the
Originator  the  Purchase  Price for the  purchase  of  Receivables  made on the
Original  Closing  Date,  [  *  ].

         3.3.  SUBSEQUENT PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENTS. On  each Business Day falling
after  the  Original  Closing  Date  and on or prior  to the  Purchase  and Sale
Termination  Date, on the terms and subject to the  conditions set forth in this
Agreement,  the Company shall pay to the  Originator  the Purchase Price for the
Receivables sold by the Originator to the Company on such Business Day, in cash,
to the extent  funds are  available  to make such  payment  and such  payment is
permitted by paragraph (o) of Exhibit IV to the Receivables  Purchase Agreement,
[  *  ].

         Servicer shall make all appropriate record keeping entries with respect
to the  Company  Note  or  otherwise  to  reflect  the  foregoing  payments  and
adjustments  pursuant to SECTION 3.4,  and  Servicer's  books and records  shall
constitute  rebuttable  presumptive  evidence  of the  principal  amount  of and
accrued  interest on the Company Note at any time.  Furthermore,  Servicer shall
hold the Company Note for the benefit of the Originator,  and all payments under
the Company Note shall be made to the Servicer for the account of the applicable
payee thereof. The Originator hereby irrevocably authorizes Servicer to mark the
Company Note  "CANCELLED" and to return the Company Note to the Company upon the
final payment thereof after the occurrence of the Purchase and Sale  Termination
Date.

         3.4.  SETTLEMENT AS TO SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES AND DILUTION.

         (a)   If on the day of  purchase or contribution of any Receivable from
the Originator hereunder,  any of the representations or warranties set forth in
SECTION 5.4,  5.11 or 5.20 is not true with respect to such  Receivable  or as a
result  of any  action  or  inaction  of the  Originator,  on any day any of the
representations  or  warranties  set forth in  SECTION  5.4,  5.11 or 5.20 is no
longer true with  respect to such a  Receivable,  then the  Purchase  Price with
respect to the  Receivables  purchased  hereunder  shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the  Outstanding  Balance of such  Receivable and shall be accounted to
the  Originator  as  provided in  SUBSECTION  (c) below;  PROVIDED,  that if the
Company  thereafter  receives payment on account of Collections due with respect
to such  Receivable,  the  Company  promptly  shall  deliver  such  funds to the
Originator.

         (b)   If,  on  any  day, the  Outstanding  Balance  of  any  Receivable
purchased  or  contributed  hereunder  is reduced or adjusted as a result of any
discount, rebate or other adjustment made by the Originator, Company or Servicer
or any setoff or dispute between the Company, the Originator or the Servicer and
an Obligor,  then the Purchase Price with respect to the  Receivables  purchased

         In order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement and to make
purchases and accept contributions hereunder, the Originator, in its capacity as
seller under this Agreement, hereby makes the representations and warranties set
forth in this ARTICLE V.

         5.1.  ORGANIZATION  AND GOOD STANDING.  The  Originator  has  been duly
incorporated  and in existence as a  corporation  under the laws of the State of
Indiana,  with power and  authority  to own its  properties  and to conduct  its
business as such  properties are presently  owned and such business is presently
conducted.

         5.2.  DUE QUALIFICATION. The  Originator is  duly licensed or qualified
to do business as a foreign  corporation  in good  standing in the  jurisdiction
where its chief executive office and principal place of business are located and
in all other  jurisdictions  in which the  ownership or lease of its property or
the conduct of its business  requires  such  licensing or  qualification  except
where the  failure  to be so  licensed  or  qualified  has not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.3.  POWER  AND  AUTHORITY; DUE  AUTHORIZATION. The Originator has (a)
all  necessary  corporate  power,  authority  and legal right (i) to execute and
deliver,  and perform its obligations under, each

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

Transaction  Document to which it is a party,  as seller,  and (ii) to generate,
own, sell, contribute and assign Receivables and Related Rights on the terms and
subject to the conditions herein and therein  provided;  and (b) duly authorized
such execution and delivery and such sale,  contribution  and assignment and the
performance of such obligations by all necessary corporate action.

         5.4.  VALID SALE OR CONTRIBUTION;  BINDING  OBLIGATIONS. Each  sale  or
contribution,  as the case may be, of Receivables and Related Rights made by the
Originator  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  constitute  a  valid  sale  or
contribution,  as the case  may be,  transfer,  and  assignment  thereof  to the
Company,  enforceable against creditors of, and purchasers from, the Originator;
and this Agreement constitutes, and each other Transaction Document to be signed
by the Originator, as seller, when duly executed and delivered, will constitute,
a legal,  valid,  and  binding  obligation  of the  Originator,  enforceable  in
accordance  with  its  terms,   except  as  enforceability  may  be  limited  by
bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization  or other  similar laws  affecting  the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general  principles of equity,
regardless  of whether such  enforceability  is  considered  in a proceeding  in
equity or at law.

         5.5.  NO VIOLATION. The  consummation of  the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Originator is
a party as seller,  and the  fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof will not
(a) conflict  with,  result in any breach of any of the terms and provisions of,
or constitute  (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under
(i)  the  Originator's  articles  of  incorporation  or  by-laws,  or  (ii)  any
indenture,  loan  agreement,  mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other  agreement  or
instrument  to which it is a party or by which it is  bound,  (b)  result in the
creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim upon any of its properties  pursuant
to the terms of any such indenture, loan agreement,  mortgage, deed of trust, or
other  agreement or instrument,  other than the  Transaction  Documents,  or (c)
violate any law or any order, writ, judgment,  award, injunction,  decree, rule,
or regulation  applicable to it or its properties,  where, in the cases of ITEMS
(a)(ii), (b) or (c), such conflict,  breach, default, Adverse Claim or violation
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.6.  PROCEEDINGS.  (i)  There  is   no   litigation,   proceeding   or
investigation pending or, to the Originator's  knowledge threatened,  before any
Government   Authority  or  arbitrator  (a)  asserting  the  invalidity  of  any
Transaction  Document to which the Originator is a party as seller,  (b) seeking
to prevent the sale or  contribution  of  Receivables  and Related Rights to the
Company or the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by any
Transaction  Document  to which  the  Originator  is a party as  seller,  or (c)
seeking any  determination or ruling that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material  Adverse  Effect.  (ii) The  Originator  is not  subject  to any order,
judgment, decree, injunction, stipulation or consent order that could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.7.  BULK SALES  ACT.  No  transaction  contemplated  hereby  requires
compliance with any bulk sales act or similar law.

to making any change in its name,  jurisdiction  of  organization or location or

                      ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IN
                           RESPECT OF THE RECEIVABLES

         7.1.  RIGHTS OF  THE  COMPANY. The  Originator  hereby  authorizes  the
Company  or  its  respective  designees  to  take  any  and  all  steps  in  the
Originator's name necessary or desirable, in their respective determination,  to
collect  all  amounts  due under any and all  Receivables  and  Related  Rights,
including,  without  limitation,  endorsing the Originator's  name on checks and
other  instruments  representing  Collections and enforcing such Receivables and
the provisions of the related Contracts that concern payment and/or  enforcement
of rights to payment.

         7.2.  RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  THE  ORIGINATOR.  Anything  herein  to  the
contrary notwithstanding:

         (a)   The  Originator  agrees  to  transfer  any  Collections  that  it
receives  directly  to a Deposit  Account  within  one  Business  Day of receipt
thereof,  and agrees that all such  Collections  shall be segregated and held in
trust for the  Company  and the Agent for the  benefit of the  Secured  Parties;
PROVIDED  that if the Company or the  Servicer is required by SECTION 4.4 of the
Receivables  Purchase  Agreement to remit Collections  directly to the Agent for
the benefit of the Secured Parties (or its designee) the Originator  shall remit
such  Collections  directly to the Agent for the benefit of the Secured  Parties
(or its designee) in the same manner as the Company and Servicer may be required
to do so by Section 4.4 of the Receivables  Purchase  Agreement.  The Originator
further  agrees not to deposit  any funds  other than  Collections  in a Deposit
Account.

         (b)   The Originator shall  perform its obligations hereunder, and  the
exercise  by the  Company  or its  designee  of its rights  hereunder  shall not
relieve the Originator from such obligations.

         (c)   None  of  the  Company,  Servicer (if other than the Originator),
Purchasers,  the Insurer or the Agent shall have any  obligation or liability to
any Obligor or any other third Person with respect to any Receivables, Contracts
related thereto or any other related agreements, nor shall the Company, Servicer
(if  other  than  the  Originator),  Purchasers,  the  Insurer  or the  Agent be
obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Originator thereunder.

         (d)   The  Originator  hereby  grants to Servicer (if  other  than  the
Originator) an irrevocable  power of attorney,  with full power of substitution,
coupled  with an  interest,  to take in the  name of the  Originator  all  steps
necessary or advisable to indorse, negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing
or other right of any kind held or  transmitted by the Originator or transmitted
or received by

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

the  Company  (whether  or not  from  the  Originator)  in  connection  with any
Receivable or Related Right.

         7.3.  FURTHER ACTION  EVIDENCING PURCHASES. The  Originator agrees that
from time to time,  at its  expense,  it will  promptly  execute and deliver all
further instruments and documents,  and take all further action that the Company
or  Servicer,  the Agent or the  Insurer may  reasonably  request or that may be
otherwise  necessary  or desirable in order to establish or maintain a valid and
enforceable  ownership  interest  in the  Receivables  and  Related  Rights  and
Collections and other proceeds with respect  thereto,  and a perfected  security
interest in the items  described  in SECTION 1.5, in each case free and clear of
any Adverse  Claim,  excepting  only  Permitted  Liens,  in favor of the Company
including,  without limitation,  taking such action to perfect,  protect or more
fully evidence the interest of the Company under this Agreement or to enable the
Company to exercise or enforce  any of its rights  hereunder  or under any other
Transaction  Document.  Without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  the
Originator will at Originator's expense:

         (a)   upon  the  request of  the  Company or the  Insurer and the Agent
authorize  and file such  financing or  continuation  statements,  or amendments
thereto or assignments thereof, and such other instruments or notices, as may be
necessary or appropriate; and

         (b)   mark the summary master control data processing records  relating
to the  Receivables  and related  Contracts with the legend set forth in SECTION
4.1(i).

The Originator hereby authorizes the Company or its designee to file one or more
financing or  continuation  statements,  and amendments  thereto and assignments
thereof,  relative to all or any of the Receivables (and the Related Rights) now
existing or hereafter  generated by the Originator.  If the Originator  fails to
perform any of its agreements or obligations  under this Agreement,  the Company
or its  designee  may (but shall not be required  to) itself  perform,  or cause
performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the Company or
its designee incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Originator
as provided in SECTION 10.6.

         7.4.  APPLICATION OF COLLECTIONS. Any payment by an  Obligor in respect
of any  indebtedness  owed by it to the  Originator  or the  Company,  shall  be
applied first,  as a Collection of any  Receivables  owed by such Obligor to the
Company,  and second to any other  indebtedness  of such Obligor.  The foregoing
notwithstanding,  a different  application of such payment is permissible if (a)
required by  contract or law,  (b)  otherwise  instructed  by the Obligor or (c)
instructed by the Company or the Agent and, in the case of (c) above,  only with
the prior written consent of the Insurer.

         Purchase  and Sale  Termination  Date  shall not deny the  Company  any
         remedy in addition to termination of the Purchase Facility to which the
         Company  may be  otherwise  appropriately  entitled,  whether at law or
         equity.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         9.1.  INDEMNITIES BY THE  ORIGINATOR. Without limiting any other rights
which the Company may have  hereunder or under  applicable  law, the  Originator
hereby agrees to indemnify the Company,  the Purchasers,  the Agent, the Insurer
and each of their respective assigns, officers, directors,  employees and agents
(each of the foregoing  Persons being  individually  called a "PURCHASE AND SALE
INDEMNIFIED PARTY"),  forthwith on demand, from and against any and all damages,
losses, claims, judgments, liabilities and related costs and expenses, including
reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements  (all  of the  foregoing  being
collectively  called  "PURCHASE AND SALE  INDEMNIFIED  AMOUNTS"),  regardless of
whether  any such  Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Amount  is the  result  of a
Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party's negligence, strict liability or other acts
or  omissions  of a Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party,  awarded  against or
incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of the following:

         (a)   the  transfer by the Originator of an  interest in any Receivable
or Related Right to any Person other than the Company;

         (b)   the  breach  of  any  representation  or  warranty  made  by  the
Originator  under or in connection with this Agreement or any other  Transaction
Document,  or any  information or report  delivered by the  Originator  pursuant
hereto or thereto  (including any  information  contained in a Purchase  Report)
which shall have been false,  incorrect or  misleading  in any material  respect
when made, deemed made or delivered;

         (c)   the failure by  the Originator to comply with any applicable law,
rule or regulation  with respect to any Receivable or the related  Contract,  or
the  nonconformity  of any  Receivable  or the  related  Contract  with any such
applicable law, rule or regulation;

         (d)   [  *  ]

         (e)   the failure of the Originator to file with respect to itself, or
any delay by the  Originator  in filing,  financing  statements or other similar
instruments or documents  under the UCC of any applicable  jurisdiction or other
applicable  laws  with  respect  to any  Receivables  or  purported  Receivables
generated  by the  Originator  or  Related  Rights,  whether  at the time of any
purchase or contribution or at any subsequent time;

         (f)   any dispute, claim,  offset  or  defense (other than discharge in
bankruptcy)  of the  Obligor  to the  payment  of any  Receivable  or  purported
Receivable generated by the Originator (including, without limitation, a defense
based on such Receivables or the related Contracts not being a legal,  valid and
binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms), or any other claim resulting from or relating to the transaction  giving
rise to any Receivable or relating to collection  activities with respect to any
Receivable (if such  collection  activities  were performed by the Originator or
any of  its  Affiliates  acting  as  Servicer  or by any  agent  or  independent
contractor retained by the Originator or any of its Affiliates);

         (g)   any products liability or  other claim, investigation, litigation
or proceeding arising out of or in connection with goods,  insurance or services
that secure or relate to any Receivable;

         (h)   any  litigation,   proceeding   or   investigation  against   the
Originator or in respect of any Receivable or Related Right;

         (i)   any  tax  or  governmental fee  or  charge (other  than  any  tax
excluded  pursuant to the proviso below),  all interest and penalties thereon or
with respect thereto,  and all out-of-pocket  costs and expenses,  including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in defending against the same, which may
arise by reason of the purchase, contribution or ownership of the Receivables or
any Related Right connected with any such Receivables;

         (j)   any  failure  of  the   Originator   to  perform  its  duties  or
obligations  in accordance  with the  provisions of this  Agreement or any other
Transaction Document;

         (k)   the commingling of any Collections at any  time with other funds;

         (l)   the failure by the Originator to  pay  when due any taxes payable
by it,  including  without  limitation,  franchise  taxes and  sales,  excise or
personal  property  taxes  payable in  connection  with the  Receivables  or any
Related Right connected with any such Receivables; and

         (m)   the   failure  by  the  Originator  to be  duly  qualified  to do
business,  to be in good  standing or to have filed  appropriate  fictitious  or
assumed name registration documents in any jurisdiction;

EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, (i) Purchase  and  Sale  Indemnified Amounts  to  the extent
resulting from gross negligence or willful  misconduct on the part of a Purchase
and Sale Indemnified  Party,  (ii) any  indemnification  which has the effect of
recourse for non-payment of the Receivables due to credit

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

reasons to the Originator (except as otherwise  specifically provided under this
SECTION  9.1) and (iii) any tax based  upon or  measured  by net income or gross
receipts.

         If for  any reason  the  indemnification provided above in this SECTION
9.1 is unavailable to a Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party or is insufficient
to hold such Purchase and Sale Indemnified  Party harmless,  then the Originator
shall  contribute  to the  amount  paid or  payable  by such  Purchase  and Sale
Indemnified  Party as a result of such loss,  claim,  damage or liability to the
maximum  extent  permitted  under  applicable  law.  Promptly after receipt by a
Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE IX of notice of any claim
or the  commencement  of any  action  arising  out of or as a  result  of any of
paragraphs (a) through (m) above, the Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party shall,
if a claim in respect  thereof is to be made against the  Originator  under this
ARTICLE IX, notify the Originator in writing of the claim or the commencement of
that action; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that the failure to notify the Originator shall
not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this ARTICLE IX except
to the extent it has been materially  prejudiced by such failure and,  PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that the failure to notify the Originator shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to a Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party otherwise
than under this ARTICLE IX. If any such claim or action shall be brought against
a Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party,  the  Originator  shall be entitled to
participate  therein  and, to the extent  that it wishes,  to assume the defense
thereof with counsel  satisfactory to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party.
After notice from the Originator to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party of
its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Originator shall
not be liable to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party under this ARTICLE IX
for any legal or other  expenses  subsequently  incurred  by  Purchase  and Sale
Indemnified  Party in connection  with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of  investigation.  The Originator shall not (i) without the prior written
consent of the relevant  Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party or Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  settle or compromise or consent to
the entry of any  judgment  with  respect to any  pending or  threatened  claim,
action,  suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution
may be sought hereunder  (whether or not the Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party
or Parties are actual or potential  parties to such claim or action) unless such
settlement,  compromise  or consent  includes an  unconditional  release of each
Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party from all  liability  arising  out of such
claim,  action,  suit or proceeding or (ii) be liable for any  settlement of any
such action  affected  without its written  consent  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a
final  judgment of the plaintiff in any such action,  the  Originator  agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified  party from and against any Purchase
and Sale Indemnified Amounts relating thereto.

         10.1.   AMENDMENTS, ETC.

         (a)     The provisions of this Agreement  may  from  time  to  time  be
amended,  modified or waived,  if such  amendment,  modification or waiver is in
writing and consented to by the Originator,  the Company, the Servicer (if other
than the  Originator)  and the  Control  Party (or if the  Control  Party is the
Majority  Purchasers,  the Agent);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no such amendment,
modification or waiver shall materially adversely affect the Insurer without the
prior written consent of the Insurer.

         (b)     No failure or delay on the part of the Company, the  Originator
or any third party  beneficiary in exercising any power or right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any
such  power or right  preclude  any other or  further  exercise  thereof  or the
exercise  of any other  power or right.  No notice to or demand on the  Company,
Servicer, or the Originator in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand
in similar  or other  circumstances.  No waiver or  approval  by the  Company or
Servicer under this Agreement  shall,  except as may otherwise be stated in such
waiver or approval,  be  applicable  to  subsequent  transactions.  No waiver or
approval under this Agreement shall require any similar or dissimilar  waiver or
approval thereafter to be granted hereunder.

         10.2.   NOTICES, ETC.  All  notices  and other communications hereunder
shall,  unless  otherwise  stated  herein,  be in writing  (which shall  include

Insurer and the Agent. This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing
obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and shall remain
in full force and effect until the date after the Purchase and Sale  Termination
Date on which the  Originator has received  payment in full for all  Receivables
and Related  Rights  purchased  pursuant  to SECTION 1.1 hereof.  The

                                      -27-

CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF INDIANA  (WITHOUT  GIVING
EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS  PRINCIPLES  THEREOF),  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF PURCHASERS IN THE  RECEIVABLES OR
RELATED RIGHTS,  OR REMEDIES  HEREUNDER IN RESPECT THEREOF,  ARE GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF INDIANA.

         10.6.   COSTS,  EXPENSES AND TAXES.  In addition to the  obligations of
the Originator under ARTICLE IX, the Originator agrees to pay on demand:

         (a)     all reasonable  costs  and  expenses  in  connection  with  the

         10.8.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH  PARTY  HERETO  EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY
