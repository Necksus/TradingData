                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",
"expects",  "intends",  "plans",  "predicts",  "projects", "will likely result",
"will continue",  or similar expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and  may  be  forward-looking.

Forward-looking  statements  involve  estimates, assumptions,  and uncertainties
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the
following important factors, which are difficult to predict, contain
uncertainties, are beyond the control of the Company and may cause   actual
results  to  differ   materially   from  those   contained   in forward-looking
statements:

     - prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those
       of the FERC, the MPUC,  the FPSC, the NCUC and the PSCW,  with respect to
       allowed rates of return,  industry and rate  structure,  acquisition  and
       disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation and  construction of plant
       facilities,  recovery of purchased  power and other capital  investments,
       and present or prospective  wholesale and retail  competition  (including
       but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs);
     - economic and geographic factors including political and economic risks;
     - changes  in  and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws  and
       policies;
     - weather conditions;
     - population  growth rates and  demographic  patterns;
     - competition for retail and wholesale customers;
     - Year 2000 issues;
        - delays or changes in costs of Year 2000 compliance;
        - failure of major suppliers, customers or others with whom the company
          does business to resolve their own Year 2000 issues on a timely basis;
     -  pricing and transportation of commodities;
     -  market demand, including structural market changes;
     -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
     -  changes in project costs;
     -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
     -  capital market conditions;
     -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and
     -  legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal) and
        settlements  that  influence  the  business  and  profitability  of  the
        Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

NOTE 3.    REGULATORY MATTERS

Florida Water 1995 Rate Case.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1 million  annual
rate  increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers  of Florida
Water  regulated  by the FPSC.  In October  1996 the FPSC issued its final order
approving an $11.1 million annual  increase.  The new rates were  implemented in
September  1996.  In November  1996 Florida  Water filed with the Florida  First
District Court of Appeals (Court of Appeals) an appeal of the FPSC's final order
seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in
utility facilities recoverable in rates from current customers. Other parties to
the rate case also filed appeals. In the course of the appeals process, the FPSC
reconsidered an issue in its initial decision and, in June 1997, allowed Florida
Water to resume collecting  approximately $1 million, on an annual basis, in new
customer  fees. On June 10, 1998 the Court of Appeals  ruled in Florida  Water's
favor on all material  issues  appealed by Florida Water and remanded the matter
back to the FPSC for action  consistent  with the  Court's  order.  The Court of
Appeals also overturned its decision in Florida Water's 1991 Rate Case which had
required a "functional  relationship" between service areas as a precondition to
implementation  of uniform rates.  On December 15, 1998 the FPSC granted Florida
Water an  additional  annual  revenue  increase of  approximately  $1.2  million
related to several of the issues reversed by the Court of Appeals, and permitted
collection of  approximately  $2.4 million in  surcharges  to reimburse  Florida
Water for revenue (plus interest)  wrongfully  denied in the FPSC's October 1996
order.  Florida Water began collecting the new rates in January 1999 and expects
to begin  collecting  the  surcharges  in mid 1999.  Intervenors  protested  the
surcharge allocation methodology. As a result collection is delayed and interest
accumulates until the FPSC approves a methodology.  The FPSC reopened the record
on two remaining issues on remand from the Court of Appeals regarding the amount
of investment in utility facilities recoverable in rates from current customers,
but no hearing dates will be set until procedural matters have been resolved.  A
decision  in  the  Company's  favor  would  result  in  additional  revenue  and
surcharges.  The  Company  is unable to  predict  the timing or outcome of these
proceedings.

1991 Rate Case Refunds.  In 1995 the Court of Appeals reversed a 1993 FPSC order
establishing  uniform  rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With
"uniform  rates" all  customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for
water and wastewater  services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order, in
August 1996 the FPSC ordered  Florida Water to issue refunds to those  customers
who paid more since  October 1993 under  uniform rates than they would have paid
under  stand-alone  rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge  to
customers who paid less under uniform  rates.  Florida Water  appealed,  and the
Court of  Appeals  ruled in June  1997 that the FPSC  could  not  order  refunds
without balancing  surcharges.  In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the
FPSC issued an order on January 26, 1998 that did not require  refunds.  Florida
Water's  potential refund liability at that time was about $12.5 million,  which
included interest, to customers who paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 26, 1998 order,  the FPSC  required  Florida Water to refund
$2.5 million,  the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service area from
January  1996 through June 1997 under  uniform  rates which  exceeded the amount
these customers would have paid under a modified stand-alone rate structure.  No
balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund because Spring
Hill customers continued to pay uniform rates after other customers began paying
modified stand-alone rates effective January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's interim
rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case (see Florida Water 1995 Rate Case).
The FPSC did not include Spring Hill in this interim rate order because Hernando
County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida
Water  reached an agreement  with  Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to
stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 26, 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund  because the
FPSC had no authority to order uniform rates.  The Company has appealed the $2.5
million refund order.  Initial briefs were filed by all parties on May 22, 1998.
Upon  issuance of the June 10, 1998 opinion of the Court of Appeals with respect
to  Florida  Water's  1995 Rate  Case  (see  1995 Rate  Case) in which the court
reversed  its  previous  ruling  that the FPSC was  without  authority  to order
uniform rates,  customer groups supporting the FPSC's January 1998 order filed a
motion  with the Court of Appeals  seeking  dismissal  of the appeal by customer
groups  seeking  refunds.  Customers  seeking  refunds filed  amended  briefs on
September 14, 1998. No provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The Company is
unable to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

Company  estimates the present value of these future water  connections  at $5.1
million. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method.  Financial
results have been included in the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements
since the date of purchase.  Pro forma financial results have not been presented
due to  immateriality.  PCUC provides service to approximately  15,000 water and
14,000 wastewater customers in Flagler County, Florida.

NOTE 7.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company has had a power  purchase  agreement with Square Butte since 1977 to
provide a long-term  supply of low-cost  energy to  customers  in the  Company's
service territory and to meet power pool reserve  requirements.  Square Butte, a
North Dakota cooperative corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating
unit (Unit) near Center, North Dakota. The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit
owned by Minnkota Power Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative
corporation  whose Class A members are also  members of Square  Butte.  Minnkota
serves as the operator of the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

In May 1998 the  Company  and Square  Butte  entered  into a new power  purchase
agreement (1998 Agreement),  replacing the 1977 agreement.  The Company extended
by 20  years,  to  January  1,  2027,  its  access to  Square  Butte's  low-cost
electricity  and  eliminated  its  unconditional  obligation  for all of  Square
Butte's  costs if not paid by Square  Butte  when due.  The 1998  Agreement  was
reached in conjunction with the termination of Square Butte's previous leveraged
lease financing arrangement and refinancing of associated debt.

Similar  to the  previous  agreement,  the  Company  is  initially  entitled  to
approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under the 1998  Agreement.  After
2005 and upon compliance with a two-year  advance notice  requirement,  Minnkota
has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a
minimum of 50 percent.

Under the 1998 Agreement,  the Company is obligated to pay its pro rata share of
Square  Butte's costs based on the  Company's  entitlement  to Unit output.  The
Company's  payment  obligation is suspended if Square Butte fails to deliver any
power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one year. Under the 1977
agreement the Company was unconditionally obligated to pay all of Square Butte's
costs,  if not paid by Square Butte when due. Square Butte's fixed costs consist
primarily  of debt  service.  At March 31,  1999  Square  Butte  had total  debt
outstanding  of $343.4  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of the years 1999 through 2002
and $23  million in 2003.  Variable  operating  costs  include the price of coal
purchased  from BNI Coal, a subsidiary  of  Minnesota  Power,  under a long-term
contract. The Company's payments to Square Butte are approved as purchased power
expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

NET INCOME

Electric  Operations  reflected  increased  sales to residential  and commercial
customers, and reduced operating expenses in 1999.

Water Services generated higher net income in 1999 due to increased  consumption
as a result of the recent  purchase of PCUC  assets and dry  weather  conditions
compared to record rainfall  during the same period in 1998. In addition,  Water
Services included increased rates approved by the FPSC in December 1998.

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

Automotive  Services  recognized  record  sales  volume in 1999 as the number of
vehicles offered for sale at ADESA auction facilities  increased 16 percent. The
maturing of AFC's recently  opened loan production  offices also  contributed to
higher net income from Automotive Services.

Investments  reported  lower net income in 1999 from  Portfolio and  Reinsurance
because of stock market volatility affecting returns from short-term investments
and a loss  reserve  established  by Capital Re for  reinsurance  of  securities
issued by CFS.  Together,  the  Company's  securities  portfolio  and its equity
investment in Capital Re earned an annualized after-tax return of 3.2 percent in
1999 (5.8 percent in 1998). In 1998 net income included dividend income received
from a venture  capital  investment and two large bulk land sales by Real Estate
Operations.



COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 1999 AND 1998

OPERATING REVENUE

Electric  Operations  operating revenue was slightly lower in 1999. Revenue from
electric sales was about the same,  even though  kilowatthour  sales were down 4
percent  from 1998.  Decreased  taconite  production,  paper  manufacturing  and
pipeline usage reduced revenue from large industrial  customers in 1999. Revenue
from residential and commercial  customers was higher in 1999 because the winter
weather in Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin was colder than 1998. Sales to other
power suppliers were lower due to less hydro generation  available in Canada and
the Midwest and a sufficient supply of generation available in the region.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 16 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 1999 (17 percent in 1998).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 6 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in both  1999 and  1998.  Sales to other  power  suppliers  and  marketers  also
accounted for 6 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both 1999 and 1998.

Water  Services  operating  revenue was $3.6 million  higher in 1999,  with $1.9
million of the increase  coming from PCUC which was  purchased in January  1999.
The remainder of the increase resulted from higher rates approved by the FPSC in
December  1998  and  more  consumption  due to dry  weather  conditions  in 1999
compared to record rainfall in 1998. Overall consumption increased 29 percent in
1999.

Automotive  Services  operating  revenue was $20.1 million higher in 1999 due to
increased  sales  at  ADESA  auction  facilities  and the  maturing  of AFC loan
production offices opened in 1998. ADESA offered for sale on consignment 396,000
vehicles  (340,000 in 1998) at its 28 auction  facilities  in 1999 (25 in 1998).
AFC financed  approximately  149,000  vehicles  (120,000 in 1998) through its 84
loan production offices in 1999 (57 in 1998).

Investments.  Portfolio  operating revenue was $6.5 million lower in 1999 due to
stock market  volatility  affecting returns from short-term  investments.  Also,
revenue in 1998 included $3.9 million of dividend income received from a venture
capital  investment.  Real Estate Operations  operating revenue was $4.5 million
lower in 1999 because 1998  included $5.1 million of revenue from two large bulk
land sales at Palm Coast.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Electric Operations operating expenses were $4.1 million lower in 1999 primarily
due to a reduction in purchased  power  expense.  Operating  expenses  were also
lower in 1999  because  the  amortization  of an early  retirement  program  was
completed in July 1998.

Water  Services  operating  expenses  were  $1.8  million  higher in 1999 due to
inclusion of PCUC operations.

Automotive  Services  operating  expenses were up $13.6 million primarily due to
increased sales activity at the auction  facilities and the floorplan  financing
business.  Additional  expenses associated with more auction facilities and loan
production offices also contributed to higher expenses in 1999.

Investments.  Real Estate Operations  operating expenses were $2.0 million lower
in 1999 due to fewer sales.

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

Corporate  Charges  operating  expenses  were $5.6 million lower in 1999 because
interest  expense in 1998  reflected  a  settlement  with the  Internal  Revenue
Service on tax issues relating to prior years. As a result of the settlement, in
the first quarter of 1998 amounts  previously accrued as income tax expense were
reversed and recorded as interest  expense.  There was no impact on consolidated
net income from this transaction.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Income (loss) from equity  investments  reflected a loss of $2.4 million in 1999
(income of $4.2 million in 1998) from the Company's equity investment in Capital
Re. The decrease was attributed to a loss reserve  established by Capital Re for
reinsurance  of  securities  issued by CFS.  CFS is under  investigation  by the
Securities and Exchange  Commission and the Oklahoma  Securities  Commission for
allegations  of  irregularities  relating  to these  securities.  CFS  filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 1998.



LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 1999
reflected  improved  operating  results and continued  focus on working  capital
management.  Cash from  operating  activities  was also  affected by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 9 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA uses commercial paper issued
by the Company to meet short-term working capital  requirements arising from the
timing of payment  obligations to vehicle sellers and the  availability of funds
from vehicle purchasers. During the sales process, ADESA does not typically take
title to vehicles.

AFC also uses  commercial  paper  issued by the Company to meet its  operational
requirements.  AFC offers  short-term  on-site financing for dealers to purchase
vehicles at auctions in exchange for a security interest in those vehicles.  The
financing  is  provided  through  the  earlier of the date the dealer  sells the
vehicle or a general  borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC sells certain finance
receivables on a revolving  basis to a wholly owned,  unconsolidated,  qualified
special purpose subsidiary. This subsidiary in turn sells, on a revolving basis,
an undivided interest in eligible finance receivables, up to a maximum of $225.0
million,  to third party  purchasers under an agreement which expires at the end
of 2001. At March 31, 1999 AFC had sold $260.9 million of finance receivables to
this subsidiary ($202.9 million at December 31, 1998). Third party purchasers
had purchased an undivided  interest in finance  receivables  of $193.0 million
from this  subsidiary  at March 31,  1999 ($170.0 million at December 31, 1998).
Proceeds from the sale of the receivables were used to repay borrowings from the
Company and fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
March 31,  1999  compared  to  December  31,  1998 were due to  increased  sales
activity by Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down during the
winter months and in December because of the holidays.  As a result,  both ADESA
and AFC had lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

Notes  payable  increased  temporarily  to  finance  Automotive  Services'  cash
requirements due to significant  auction sales and financing growth. The Company
also  used  the  temporary  increase  in notes  payable  and  proceeds  from the
September  1998  issuance of Common Stock to fund the January  1999  purchase of
PCUC.  Florida Water purchased the assets of PCUC from ITT Industries,  Inc. for
$16.8 million plus $1,000 per new water connection for an eight-year period. The
Company estimates the present value of these future water connections to be $5.1
million.

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the three months
ended March 31, 1999 totaled $15.3 million ($16.5 million in 1998). Expenditures
for 1999 included $6.6 million for Electric  Operations,  $4.2 million for Water
Services and $4.5 million for Automotive  Services.  Internally  generated funds
and proceeds from the  September  1998 issuance of Common Stock were the primary
sources of funding for these expenditures.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. In June 1998 the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,"  effective for fiscal years
beginning  after June 15, 1999.  SFAS 133  establishes  accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative  instrument be recorded on the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair value. SFAS 133 requires
that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized  currently in earnings
unless  specific  hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Special  accounting  for
qualifying  hedges allows a derivative's  gains and losses to offset the related
results on the hedged item.  The Company  currently has only a limited amount of
derivative  activity and adoption of SFAS 133 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's  financial position and results of operations.  However,
Capital  Re has  determined  that it is  likely  that its  credit  default  swap
business will be subject to the  requirements  of SFAS 133 and is in the process
of determining  what the effect will be on its earnings and financial  position.
The Company  accounts for its  investment  in Capital Re under the equity method
and is unable to predict the impact of Capital Re's adoption of SFAS 133.

YEAR 2000.  The Year 2000 issue relates to computer  systems that  recognize the
year in a date field using only the last two digits. Unless corrected,  the Year
2000 may be interpreted as 1900, causing errors or shutdowns in computer systems
which may, in turn, disrupt operations.

State of Readiness. The Company has been addressing the Year 2000 issue for five
years. In the ordinary course of business, it has replaced, or is in the process
of replacing, many of its major computer systems with new systems that have been
designed  to be Year 2000  compliant.  These  updated  systems  handle  critical
aspects of the Company's operations,  including energy management and generation
control  for  Electric  Operations,   and  customer  information  and  financial
management Company-wide.

Each of the  business  segments  has its own  Year  2000  plan,  which  has been
reviewed and is being monitored by a  corporate-level  Year 2000 Risk Assessment
Team.  The  Company's  plan  for  Year  2000  readiness  involves  four  phases:
inventory,  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency  planning.  Testing is an
ongoing  and  integral  part  of the  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency
planning phases.

     Inventory.  Each business  segment has performed an extensive  inventory of
     its  information  technology  systems and other  systems  that use embedded
     microprocessors (collectively, "Systems"). The business processes supported
     by each System have been prioritized based on the degree of impact business
     operations would encounter if the System were disrupted.

     The inventory phase also includes  identifying  third parties with whom the
     Company  has  material  relationships.  The degree to which  each  business
     segment depends on third party support varies.  Water Services,  Automotive
     Services and Real Estate  Operations have  identified  minimal risk in most
     areas. Where a third party is critical to a business process,  efforts have
     been initiated to obtain Year 2000  compliance  information to identify the
     degree of risk exposure the Company may encounter.  Electric  Operations is
     working with its large power  customers to share Year 2000  information and
     determine their readiness. In addition, Electric Operations is working with
     its fuel and  transportation  providers  in an effort  to  ensure  adequate
     supplies of fuel.

     The  electric  industry is unique in its  reliance on the  integrity of the
     power pool grid to support and  maintain  reliable,  efficient  operations.
     Preparation for the Year 2000 by Electric  Operations is linked to the Year
     2000 compliance efforts of other utilities as well as to those of its major
     customers  whose  loads  support  the  integrity  of the power  pool  grid.
     Electric  Operations is  coordinating  its Year 2000 efforts with the plans
     established by the North American  Electric  Reliability  Council under the
     direction  of the U.S.  Department  of Energy and is also  working with the
     MAPP Year 2000 Task Force and a utility  industry  consortium to obtain and
     share utility-specific Year 2000 compliance information.

     The  internal  inventory  phase was  substantially  completed in June 1998.
     Regular  contact  with third  parties  with whom the Company  has  material
     relationships will continue throughout 1999.

                                   -11-

<PAGE>

     Evaluation.  This phase involves  computer program code review and testing,
     vendor contacts,  System testing and fully-integrated  System testing where
     practical.  The  objective  of this  phase is to  develop  and  update  the
     remediation  plan.  Some Systems,  upon  inspection,  are  determined to be
     non-compliant and are immediately placed on the remediation schedule.  Some
     Systems  require  testing to determine  compliance  status.  The evaluation
     phase was substantially complete in February 1999.

     Remediation.  In this  phase  each  System is  either  fixed,  replaced  or
     removed.  Critical Systems fixed or replaced are tested again for Year 2000
     readiness.  Remediation is expected to be  substantially  complete by
     June 30, 1999. The Company estimates that as of May 7, 1999 the remediation
     phase is  approximately  57 percent complete based on the number of systems
     remediated.

     Contingency Planning. Each business segment has developed contingency plans
     designed  to  continue   critical   processes  in  the  event  the  Company
     experiences Year 2000 disruptions  despite  remediation and testing.  These
     plans include establishment of internal  communications,  securing adequate
     on-site  supplies of certain  critical  materials and staffing for key Year
     2000 dates.  Contingency plans will also be tested when  appropriate.  Some
     contingency plans have already undergone testing.  The Company successfully
     participated  in the April 9, 1999 NERC drill which  tested inter and intra
     backup communications for the scenario that assumed 10 percent of voice and
     data  communications  had failed.  The Company plans to  participate in the
     September  1999  NERC  drill  which  will  be a  dress  rehearsal  for  the
     millennium  rollover.  Contingency  plans are expected to be  substantially
     complete by June 30, 1999. The Company estimates that as of May 7, 1999 the
     contingency planning phase is approximately 75 percent complete.

The Company is on schedule for substantial Year 2000 readiness by June 30, 1999,
with certain  systems  reserved for final  integrated  testing during  scheduled
maintenance outages at certain Company generating  facilities in the second half
of 1999.

Costs. In the ordinary course of business over the last five years,  the Company
has replaced major business and operating computer systems. These systems should
require  minimal  remediation  efforts  because of their recent  implementation.
Formal Year 2000  readiness  plans were  established  in March 1998.  Since that
time,  the Company has  incurred  $1.7 million in expenses  primarily  for labor
associated  with  inventory,  evaluation and  remediation  efforts.  The Company
estimates its remaining costs to prepare for the Year 2000 will be $5 million to
$7  million,  the  majority of which are  non-labor  costs that will be incurred
during the second and third quarters of 1999.  Funds to address Year 2000 issues
have been provided for in the Company's  existing  budgets.  These costs include
the  assignment of existing  personnel to Year 2000  projects,  maintenance  and
repair expenses, and capitalized improvements. To date no critical projects have
been deferred because of Year 2000 issues.  The Company does not anticipate that
its costs  associated  with Year  2000  readiness  will  materially  impact  the
Company's earnings in any year.

Risks.  Based upon  information to date, the Company  believes that, in the most
reasonably likely worst-case scenario, Year 2000 issues could result in abnormal
operating   conditions,   such  as  short-term   interruption   of   generation,
transmission and distribution  functions within Electric Operations,  as well as
Company-wide loss of system monitoring and control functions,  and loss of voice
communications.  These  conditions,  along with power  outages  due to  possible
instability  of  the  regional  electric  transmission  grid,  could  result  in
temporary interruption of service to customers. The Company does not believe the
overall  impact of this  scenario  will have a material  impact on its financial
condition  or  operations   due  to  the   anticipated   short-term   nature  of
interruptions.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's  securities portfolio has exposure to both price and interest rate
risk.  Investments held principally for near-term sale are classified as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies,  with utilities being the largest
industry  sector.  Investments  held  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time  are
classified as available-for-sale securities and also recorded at fair value. The
available-for-sale  securities  portfolio  consists  primarily of the  preferred
stock of  utilities  and  financial  institutions  with  investment  grade  debt
ratings.

In strategies  designed to reduce  market risks,  the Company sells common stock
short and enters into short sales of treasury futures contracts.  Selling common
stock short is intended to reduce price risks  associated with securities in the
Company's trading securities portfolio.  The stock sold short consists primarily
of the stock of companies in similar industries.  Treasury futures are used as a
hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks  associated  with holding  fixed  dividend
preferred  stocks  included  in  the  Company's  available-for-sale   securities
portfolio. Generally, treasury futures contracts mature in 90 days.

PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION


ITEM 5.    OTHER INFORMATION

Reference is made to the Company's 1998 Form 10-K for background  information on
the following updates.  Unless otherwise indicated,  cited references are to the
Company's 1998 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 2. - Electric Sales - Eighth Paragraph
Ref. Page 25. - Outlook - Electric Operations - Tenth Paragraph

In 1998 the  United  States  imported a record 42  million  tons of steel  which
represented  an 83 percent  increase  over the 23 million  ton  average  for the
previous eight years (1990-1997).

For the first three months of 1999,  United States imports were running at about
the same levels as 1998. However, the United States Commerce Department has made
preliminary  findings  that set  substantial  antidumping  margins on hot rolled
steel  products  from  Japan and  Brazil,  and  countervailing  duty  margins on
products from Brazil. This action should have a positive effect for the domestic
steel industry by reducing imports.

If imports  continue  at 1998  levels,  lower  demand for steel  produced in the
United States is likely to have an adverse affect on the taconite  producers and
the economy as a whole in Northern  Minnesota.  The Company is unable to predict
the eventual impact of this issue on the Company's Electric Operations.

On March 18, 1999 the  Company,  through  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Rainy River
Energy  Corporation,  entered into a 15-year  power  purchase  agreement  with a
subsidiary of LS Power,  LLC (LS Power),  a privately  owned  independent  power
producer.  Under the  agreement,  the Company will  purchase  approximately  275
megawatts  from a 1,100 megawatt  natural  gas-fired  combined cycle  generation
facility to be built,  owned and  operated by LS Power near  Chicago,  Illinois.
Construction  of the generation  facility is scheduled to begin in mid 1999 with
commercial  operation  expected in mid 2001.  The Company  expects the agreement
will  enhance  its  ability  to serve an  expanding  customer  base  outside  of
Wisconsin  and  Minnesota,  as well as enable  additional  participation  in the
wholesale bulk power marketplace.

Generally,  there will be a charge for both capacity  made  available and energy
delivered.  The Company will be obligated to pay the capacity  related charge as
long as capacity is made available.  The capacity related charge will be reduced
if capacity is not available and replacement power is not provided.  The Company
will be  responsible  for the  purchase and  transportation  of natural gas. The
Company  will  incur  no  significant   charges  until  the  facility  commences
operations.

The Company can terminate the agreement under certain  circumstances,  including
prolonged construction delays or facility outages.

In 1998 the MPUC  initiated a proceeding to analyze the  recommendation  made by
the Minnesota  Department of Public Service to discontinue  the recovery of lost
margins for investments in  Conservation  Improvement  Programs (CIP).  The MPUC
required the Company and other gas and electric utilities to file specific plans
for phasing-out lost margin recovery.  The Company has proposed a phase-out plan
that  would  recover  the lost  margins  associated  with large  power  customer
contract revisions related to CIP activity. If the plan is accepted by the MPUC,
the Company would recover  approximately  $3.5 million in 1999, and $2.0 million
in each of the years 2000,  2001,  2002 and 2003. The MPUC has not established a
time frame for acting on these  proposals,  and the Company is unable to predict
the outcome of this matter.

Public  Service  Commission of  Wisconsin.  On April 15, 1999  Wisconsin  Public
Service  Corporation  (WPSC) and Minnesota Power announced a preliminary plan to
construct a 250 mile 345-kilovolt  transmission  line from Wausau,  Wisconsin to
Duluth,   Minnesota.   The  project,  called  "Power  Up  Wisconsin,"  is  being
constructed to enhance reliability in Wisconsin and is estimated to cost between
$125  million  and  $175  million.  Potential  routes  for the  line  are  being
developed,  using  current  rights-of-way  where  possible.  The  plan  will  be
submitted  to the  PSCW  and the  Minnesota  Environmental  Quality  Board  when
construction permit applications are filed this summer.  Depending on siting and
regulatory  review and approval,  the line could be in service  during 2002. The
Company  currently  anticipates  an  approximate  50  percent  ownership  in the
project.
