Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be
read in  conjunction  with the  Company's  1995 Form 10-K. In the opinion of the
Company,  all adjustments  necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
interim  periods have been  included.  The results of operations  for an interim
period  may not give a true  indication  of  results  for the year.  The  income
statement information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect the way
in which the Company  currently  reports  information  regarding its businesses.
Financial  statement  information is not comparable  between  periods due to the
purchase of 80 percent of ADESA in July 1995 and the  purchase of the  remaining
20 percent in 1996.

Note 2.   Regulatory Matters


FPSC Refund Order in Connection with 1993 Rate Case. On August 14, 1996 the FPSC
ordered  SSU to  refund  about  $10  million,  including  interest,  to  certain
customers  who had paid  more to SSU under a uniform  rate  structure  than they
would have paid under a stand-alone  rate structure  during the period September
1993 to January 1996.  In so ruling,  the FPSC  determined  that a February 1996
decision  of the Florida  Supreme  Court in GTE Florida v. FPSC did not render a
refund requirement unlawful independent of an offsetting surcharge. SSU believes
that  the GTE  Florida  decision  substantiates  SSU's  claim  that it  would be
unlawful for the FPSC to order a refund to certain customers who paid more under
uniform  rates  without also  permitting  SSU to recover the refund  amount from
remaining  customers who paid less. SSU has recorded no provision for refund. On
September 3, 1996 SSU appealed the FPSC's order to the First  District  Court of
Appeals. A decision on this appeal is anticipated in early 1998.

SSU's  1995  Rate  Case.  SSU  implemented  new water  and  wastewater  rates on
September 20, 1996 that will result in an annualized  increase of  approximately
$11.1  million in revenue.  SSU requested an $18.1 million rate increase in June
1995. Approved interim rates of $7.9 million on an annualized basis have been in
effect since  January 23, 1996.  Though a final order has not yet been issued by
the FPSC,  SSU  anticipates  that it will  appeal  certain  aspects  of the FPSC
decision.

In March 1995 based on the  results of a project  which  analyzed  the  economic
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board
of directors of Lehigh  directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's
assets in a manner that would  maximize  utilization  of tax benefits.  Based on
this directive,  Lehigh  recognized $18.4 million of income in the first quarter
of 1995 by reducing the valuation  reserve which offsets deferred tax assets. In
May 1996 an additional $2 million of income was recognized and in September 1996
$4  million  of  income  was  recognized  based on a  management  review  of the
appropriateness of the valuation reserve. Additional unrealized net deferred tax
assets of $2.2  million  resulting  from the  original  purchase  of Lehigh  are
included on the Company's  balance  sheet.  These assets are fully offset by the
deferred tax asset  valuation  allowance  because  under  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes," it is currently
"more  likely  than not" that the value of these  assets  will not be  realized.
Management  reviews the  appropriateness of the valuation  allowance  quarterly.

Note 4. Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. Under
the terms of the contract which extends  through 2007, the Company is purchasing
71 percent of the output from a generating  plant which is capable of generating
up to 470 MW.  Reductions  to about 49 percent of the output are provided for in
the contract and, at the option of Square  Butte,  could begin after a five-year
advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power  and  energy is a  proportionate  share of Square  Butte's
fixed obligations and variable  operating costs,  based on the percentage of the
total  output  purchased by the Company.  The annual  fixed  obligations  of the
Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1996 through  2000.  The variable
operating costs are not incurred unless  production  takes place. The Company is
responsible  for paying all costs and  expenses  of Square  Butte if not paid by
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company are
absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered to the
Company.

Note 5.   Preferred Stock

On May 13, 1996 Minnesota Power redeemed all of the 170,000  outstanding  shares
of its Serial  Preferred Stock,  $7.36 Series.  The redemption price was $103.34
per share plus  accrued and unpaid  dividends  in the amount of $.86 per share.
Proceeds from the QUIPS financing in March 1996 were used to redeem the shares.

Note 6.   Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of MP&L Capital I

MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company  for the  purpose of  issuing  common and  preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  On March 20, 1996 the Trust  publicly  issued three  million 8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial  interests in the assets held by the Trust,  indirectly  resulting in
net proceeds to the Company of $72.3 million.  Holders of the QUIPS are entitled
to receive  quarterly  distributions  at an annual  rate of 8.05  percent of the
liquidation  preference  value of $25 per security.  The Company is the owner of
all the common trust securities, which constitute approximately 3 percent of the
aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust Securities.  The sole asset of the
Trust is $77.5 million of 8.05% Junior  Subordinated  Debentures,  Series A, Due
2015  (Subordinated  Debentures)  issued by the  Company,  interest  on which is
deductible by the Company for income tax  purposes.  The Trust will use interest
payments received on the Subordinated  Debentures it holds to make the quarterly
cash distributions on the QUIPS.

The QUIPS are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated
Debentures  at  maturity or upon  redemption.  The Company has the option at any
time on or after March 20, 2001, to redeem the Subordinated Debentures, in whole
or in part.  The Company  also has the option,  upon the  occurrence  of certain
events, (i) to redeem at any time the Subordinated Debentures,  in whole but not
in part,  which would result in the redemption of all the Trust  Securities,  or
(ii) to  terminate  the  Trust  and  cause  the  pro  rata  distribution  of the
Subordinated Debentures to the holders of the Trust Securities.

In addition to the Company's obligations under the Subordinated Debentures,  the
Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, payment of distributions on the
Trust  Securities,  to the  extent  the Trust has  funds  available  to pay such
distributions,  and has  agreed to pay all of the  expenses  of the Trust  (such
additional  obligations  collectively,  the  Back-up  Undertakings).  Considered
together, the Back-up Undertakings constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
by the Company of the Trust's obligations under the QUIPS.

Note 7.   Long-Term Debt

On May 30, 1996 ADESA  issued $90 million of 7.70% Senior  Notes,  Series A, Due
2006 in a  private  placement  offering.  Proceeds  were  used by ADESA to repay
existing indebtedness,  including borrowings under ADESA's revolving bank credit
agreement,  floating  rate option notes and certain  borrowings  from  Minnesota
Power.

In June 1996 Lehigh  obtained a $20 million  adjustable  rate  revolving line of
credit due in 2003. The proceeds were used to partially  finance the acquisition
of real estate near Palm Coast, Florida.

Note 8.   Common Stock

Shareholder  Rights Plan. On July 24, 1996 the Board of Directors of the Company
adopted a rights  plan  (Rights  Plan)  pursuant to which it declared a dividend
distribution of one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each  outstanding
share of Common Stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on July
24, 1996 (the Record Date) and authorized the issuance of one Right with respect
to each share of Common Stock that becomes  outstanding  between the Record Date
and July 23, 2006, or such earlier time as the Rights are redeemed.

Each Right will be  exercisable  to  purchase  one  one-hundredth  of a share of
Junior Serial Preferred Stock A, without par value, at an exercise price of $90,
subject to adjustment,  following a distribution date which shall be the earlier
to occur of (i) 10 days following a public  announcement  that a person or group
(Acquiring  Person) has acquired,  or obtained the right to acquire,  beneficial
ownership of 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (Stock
Acquisition  Date)  or (ii) 15  business  days  (or  such  later  date as may be
determined by the Board of Directors  prior to the time that any person  becomes
an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or a public  announcement of
an intention to make, a tender or exchange offer if, upon consummation  thereof,
such person would meet the 15 percent threshold.

Subject  to  certain  exempt  transactions,  in the  event  that the 15  percent
threshold is met, each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring  Person) will
thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise at the then current exercise
price of the Right, Common Stock (or, in certain  circumstances,  cash, property
or other  securities  of the  Company)  having a value  equal to two  times  the
exercise  price of the Right.  If, at any time  following the Stock  Acquisition
Date,  the  Company  is  acquired  in a  merger  or other  business  combination
transaction  or 50 percent or more of the Company's  assets or earning power are
sold,  each Right will entitle the holder (other than the  Acquiring  Person) to
receive,  upon exercise at the then current exercise price of the Right,  common
stock of the  acquiring or surviving  company  having a value equal to two times
the exercise price of the Right.  Certain stock acquisitions will also trigger a
provision permitting the Board of Directors to exchange each Right for one share
of Common Stock.

The Rights are  nonvoting  and expire on July 23, 2006,  unless  redeemed by the
Company  at a price  of $.01 per  Right  at any time  prior to the time a person
becomes  an  Acquiring  Person.  The  Board  of  Directors  has  authorized  the
reservation  of one  million  shares  of  Junior  Serial  Preferred  Stock A for
issuance under the Rights Plan in the event of exercise of the Rights.

Stock  Option and Award  Plans.  In May 1996  Company  shareholders  approved an
Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan (the  Executive  Plan) and a
Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive Plan (the Director  Plan),  both effective
January 1, 1996.

The  Executive  Plan allows for the grant of up to 2.1 million  shares of Common
Stock to key  employees of the Company.  Such grants may be in the form of stock
options and other awards, including stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance  units and performance  shares.  In January 1996 the Company granted
non-qualified  stock  options to  purchase  132,542  shares of Common  Stock and
granted 176,616  performance shares.  Additionally,  24,000 restricted shares of
Common  Stock were  granted,  with the  restriction  expiring  over a four-year
period.  Pursuant to the Director  Plan each  nonemployee  director  receives an
annual grant of 725 stock  options and a biennial  grant of  performance  shares
equal to $10,000  in value of Common  Stock on the date of grant.  The  Director
Plan provides for the grant of up to 150,000 shares of Common Stock.

The exercise  price for stock options is equal to the market value of the Common
Stock on the date of a grant.  Stock  options may be exercised 50 percent on the
first  anniversary  date of the grant and the remaining 50 percent on the second
anniversary,  and expire on the tenth anniversary.  Grants of performance shares
are earned over  multi-year  time periods upon the  achievement  of  performance
objectives.

The Company  has  elected to  recognize  compensation  cost for its  stock-based
compensation  plans in accordance with Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No.
25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  Generally,  no  compensation
expense is recognized for stock options with exercise prices equal to the market
value of the underlying  shares of stock at the date of the grant.  Compensation
cost is recognized over the vesting periods for performance and restricted share
awards  based on the market  value of the  underlying  shares of stock.

Note 9. Acquisitions

Minority  Interest  in ADESA.  On  August  21,  1996 the  Company  acquired  the
remaining  17 percent  ownership  interest  of ADESA  from the ADESA  management
shareholders.  The  acquisition  of ADESA has been  accounted for as a purchase.
Acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets associated with this acquisition
are being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over  periods not  exceeding  40
years.  The acquisition  was funded from proceeds  received from the issuance of
commercial paper.

Auto Auctions in Texas. On September 30, 1996 Minnesota Power exchanged  473,006
shares of Common Stock for all the  outstanding  shares of common stock of Alamo
Auto  Auction,  Inc. and Alamo Auto Auction  Houston,  Inc. The Common Stock was
issued by the  Company  and  delivered  to the  sellers  in a private  placement
transaction  that has been accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The two new
auto auction  businesses are located in San Antonio and Houston,  Texas. The San
Antonio site is on 48 acres and has five auction lanes. The Houston site is on 9
acres,  has two auction  lanes and recently  commenced  operations.  Given the
relatively  small  size  of  the  transaction,  the  prior  period  consolidated
financial  statements have not been restated and separate  results of operations
are not presented.

Note 10. Discontinued Operations

On June 30,  1995  Minnesota  Power  sold its  interest  in the  paper  and pulp
business.  The financial  results of the paper and pulp business,  including the
loss on disposition, have been accounted for as discontinued operations.

The Company is still committed to a maximum  guaranty of $95 million to ensure a
portion of a $33.4  million  annual lease  obligation  for paper mill  equipment
under an operating lease extending to 2012. The purchaser of the Company's paper
and pulp business, CPI, has agreed to indemnify the Company for any payments the
Company  may make as a  result  of the  Company's  obligation  relating  to this
operating lease.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
           Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota  Power  has  operations  in  four  business  segments:   (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
operations,   which  include  water  and  wastewater  services;  (3)  automobile
auctions,  which also include a finance  company and an auto transport  company;
and (4)  investments,  which  include real estate  operations  in Florida,  a 21
percent equity investment in a financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and a
securities portfolio.

Earnings per share of common stock for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 were
58 cents compared to 52 cents for the quarter ended  September 30, 1995.  Higher
earnings in 1996 were  attributed  primarily to the performance of the Company's
portfolio and real estate  investments  offset in part by a decrease in
earnings from electric operations.

Earnings per share of common stock for the nine months ended  September 30, 1996
were $1.68  compared  to $1.79 for the nine months  ended  September  30,  1995.
Although  1996  includes  increased  earnings  from  water  operations,  a  gain
resulting from the sale of certain water operations, the inclusion of automobile
auctions and improvement in real estate operations (excluding the recognition of
tax benefits),  higher earnings in 1995 were attributed to the 52 cent per share
recognition of tax benefits  associated  with real estate  operations  offset in
part by an 18 cent per share provision associated with exiting the truck-mounted
lifting  equipment  business.  The sale of the Company's paper and pulp business
was included in 1995 as discontinued operations.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Quarters Ended September 30, 1996 and 1995.

Electric Operations.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations were
higher in 1996 compared to 1995. Total  kilowatthour  sales increased 13 percent
due to the Company's marketing of energy to other power suppliers.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 32 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1996  compared  to 34 percent in 1995.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 11 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1996 and 12 percent in 1995. Sales to other power
suppliers  accounted  for 17  percent  of  electric  operating  revenue  in 1996
compared to 13 percent in 1995.

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

Although revenue from electric  operations was higher,  earnings for the quarter
ended  September  30, 1996 were lower  reflecting  efforts in preparing  for and
meeting the more competitive  challenges of today's  electric utility  industry.
New  industrial  rates were  lower on average  while  expenses  associated  with
marketing new products and improving  customer  service were higher.  Also,  the
average revenue per kilowatthour sold to other power suppliers was lower in 1996
due to cooler summer  weather  compared to 1995 and more  competitive  wholesale
pricing.  Additionally,  1996  expenses  include  three  months of  amortization
associated with the 1995 early retirement plan compared to two months in 1995.

Water Operations. Operating revenue and income from water operations were higher
in 1996 due to increased sales and higher rates.  SSU added 17,000 new water and
wastewater  customers as a result of the December 1995 purchase of the assets of
Orange Osceola in Florida.  On September 20, 1996 SSU  implemented new water and
wastewater  rates that will result in an  annualized  increase of  approximately
$11.1  million  in  revenue.  Approved  interim  rates  of  $7.9  million  on an
annualized  basis have been in effect since  January 23, 1996.  Operating  costs
also  increased  in 1996 due to the  additional  customers  from the purchase of
Orange Osceola.

Automobile  Auctions.  Higher operating revenue and income from ADESA in 1996 is
attributed to 32,000 more cars being sold. Many of these cars received ancillary
services,  such as  transportation,  reconditioning,  and bodywork.  Also, three
additional  auction sites were purchased during the quarter.  Operating expenses
include  significant  start-up  costs at two other new locations  added in 1996,
relocation  costs for three existing  auction  operations  and additional  costs
associated with reorganization  following the purchase of the remaining minority
interest in ADESA from ADESA's management shareholders.

Investments.
   - Securities  Portfolio and Reinsurance.  The Company's securities portfolio
     and reinsurance  performed well in 1996. Even though the average  portfolio
     balance has been  smaller  because a portion of the  portfolio  was sold in
     1995 to fund the purchase of ADESA,  a favorable  market has helped achieve
     good returns.

   - Real Estate  Operations.  Land sales increased due to additional  property
     available for sale  following the  acquisition of Palm Coast in April 1996.
     In  addition,  the  recognition  of $4  million of tax  benefits  at Lehigh
     contributed to a strong  quarter for the Company's real estate  business in
     1996.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 1996 and 1995.

Electric Operations.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations were
higher  in  1996  compared  to  1995  due  to a 19  percent  increase  in  total
kilowatthour  sales.  The  increase  in sales  is  attributed  primarily  to the
Company's marketing of energy to other power suppliers as well as extreme winter
weather in 1996 compared to the milder winter in 1995.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 32 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1996  compared  to 35 percent in 1995.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 11 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1996 and 13 percent in 1995. Sales to other power
suppliers  accounted  for 14  percent  of  electric  operating  revenue  in 1996
compared to 9 percent in 1995.

Revenue from sales of  electricity  was up in 1996,  but provided lower margins
due to the cooler summer weather in 1996 and more competitive wholesale pricing.
Square Butte, one of Minnesota Power's low priced sources of energy, produced 34
percent  more  energy  in  1996,  while  in  1995  it  was  down  for  scheduled
maintenance. Costs associated with the early retirement offering in mid-1995 are
being  amortized  over three  years.  Expenses in 1996  included  nine months of
amortization,  while  1995  included  only  two  months.  Scheduled  maintenance
expenses were higher in 1996.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>


Water Operations. Operating revenue and income from water operations were higher
in 1996 due to the $1.1 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Seabrook's  assets
in South Carolina,  the addition of 17,000 new water and wastewater customers as
a result of the  December  1995  purchase  of the  assets of Orange  Osceola  in
Florida,  and SSU's  implementation  of a $7.9  million  interim  rate  increase
effective  January 23, 1996.  Operating  costs also increased in 1996 due to the
additional customers from the purchase of Orange Osceola.

Automobile  Auctions.  Automobile  auction  operations were  profitable  despite
severe winter  weather on the east coast which limited  auction sales in January
1996.  Operating  revenue  and  income  has been  strong  in 1996 as a result of
increased  ancillary  services,  such  as  transportation,  reconditioning,  and
bodywork. New auctions began operations at Jacksonville, Florida and Newark, New
Jersey in 1996.  Start-up  costs  associated  with  these  new sites  have had a
negative  impact on  profitability  of this segment and are expected to continue
having such an impact on results through 1996.  ADESA's wholly owned subsidiary,
Automotive  Finance  Corporation,  continues to grow and  contribute to results.
Collectively, the other auction sites have performed well in 1996.

Consolidated  operating  expenses  in 1996 are  significantly  higher due to the
inclusion of ADESA's  operations  following  its purchase by the Company in July
1995.

Investments.
   - Securities  Portfolio and Reinsurance.  The Company's securities portfolio
     and reinsurance  performed well in 1996. Even though the average  portfolio
     balance has been  smaller  because a portion of the  portfolio  was sold in
     1995 to fund the purchase of ADESA,  a favorable  market has helped achieve
     good returns.

   - Real Estate  Operations.  Revenue in 1996  includes  $3.7 million from the
     sale of  Lehigh's  joint  venture in a resort and golf  course.  Based on a
     management quarterly review of the appropriateness of the valuation reserve
     which  offsets  deferred tax assets,  Lehigh  recognized  $6 million of tax
     benefits in 1996 and $18.4  million of tax benefits in 1995.  The Company's
     portion of the tax  benefits  reflected  as net income was $4.8  million in
     1996 and $14.7 million in 1995.

Corporate  Charges and Other.  In March 1995 the  Company  recorded a $5 million
provision,  lowering  earnings per share by 18 cents, in anticipation of exiting
the truck-mounted lifting equipment business.

Discontinued  Operations.  Income from discontinued  operations in 1995 reflects
the  operating  results  of the paper and pulp  business  which was sold in June
1995.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Reference  is made to the  Consolidated  Statement  of Cash  Flows  for the nine
months  ended  September  30,  1996 and  1995,  for  purposes  of the  following
discussion. Automobile auction operations are included as of July 1995.

Cash Flow Activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial paper. In August 1996,  commercial paper was also used to finance the
purchase of the minority interest of ADESA. In addition,  securities investments
can be liquidated to provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or
acquisition of new businesses, and approximately 5 million original issue shares
of common stock are available for issuance through the DRIP.

MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company for the purpose of issuing common and preferred securities. On March 20,
1996 the Trust publicly issued three million 8.05%  Cumulative  Quarterly Income
Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred beneficial interests in the
assets held by the Trust, indirectly resulting in net proceeds to the Company of
$72.3 million. The net proceeds to the Company were used to retire approximately
$56 million of  commercial  paper and  approximately  $17  million  were used to
redeem all of the outstanding  shares of the Company's  Serial  Preferred Stock,
$7.36 Series, on May 13, 1996. 

                                  -12-
<PAGE>

On May 30, 1996 ADESA  issued $90 million of 7.70% Senior  Notes,  Series A, Due
2006 in a  private  placement  offering.  Proceeds  were  used by ADESA to repay
existing indebtedness,  including borrowings under ADESA's revolving bank credit
agreement,  floating  rate option notes and certain  borrowings  from  Minnesota
Power.

In June 1996 Lehigh  obtained a $20 million  adjustable  rate  revolving line of
credit due in 2003. The proceeds were used to partially  finance the acquisition
of real estate near Palm Coast, Florida.

On June 24, 1996 the Company's  registration  with the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission  became  effective  with  respect to 5 million  additional  shares of
Common Stock for offer and sale  pursuant to the DRIP.  Previously  available to
registered  holders and electric utility  customers,  the DRIP has been amended,
effective July 2, 1996, to, among other things,  expand the customer feature and
allow any interested  investor to enroll in the plan with an initial  investment
of $250.  Capital  raised through the sale of new issue shares under the DRIP is
expected to be used for general corporate purposes.

On September 30, 1996 Minnesota Power  exchanged  473,006 shares of Common Stock
for all the outstanding  shares of common stock of Alamo Auto Auction,  Inc. and
Alamo Auto Auction Houston,  Inc. The Common Stock was issued by the Company and
delivered  to the  sellers  in a  private  placement  transaction  that has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests.

Capital  Requirements.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures  for the nine months
ended  September 30, 1996 totaled $77 million.  These  expenditures  include $27
million  for  electric  operations,  $14 million  for water  operations  and $36
million for automobile auction operations.  Internally  generated funds were the
primary  source for funding  electric and water  operation  expenditures.  ADESA
issued long-term debt to finance its capital expenditures.

granting a new license for the  Company's St. Louis River  Project.  On June 28,
1996  separate  petitions  for  review  were filed in the same court by the U.S.
Department of the Interior and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake  Superior  Chippewa,
two intervenors in the licensing proceedings.  The issues to be resolved concern
the  terms and  conditions  of the  license  which  will  govern  the  Company's
operation and maintenance of the project. By an order issued on July 3, 1996 the
court  consolidated  the three  petitions  for  review.  On October 16, 1996 the
Company  filed  with the court an  unopposed  motion for a  procedural  schedule
pursuant to which the briefing of the issues would be completed on May 17, 1997.

The wholesale  transmission  tariff filed on April 16, 1996, in  anticipation of
new rules  governing  open access  transmission  for wholesale  service,  became
effective  on June 16,  1996,  subject  to refund  pending  a hearing  before an
Administrative Law Judge and final FERC approval. A hearing previously scheduled
for January 14, 1997 has been deferred pending  discussions  which could resolve
some or all of the issues in the  proceeding.  As required by Order No. 888, the
Company  filed  with  the  FERC  on  July  9,  1996 a  tariff  for  open  access
transmission  service  incorporating  the terms and conditions of the FERC's pro
forma tariff with appropriate  modifications.  In further  compliance with Order
No.  888,  the  Company  also  filed  with the FERC  information  setting  forth
separately the rates for power sales and transmission services which are bundled
together  in the rate  schedules  and  tariffs for  wholesale  customers  taking
requirements service from the Company. On October 16, 1996 the FERC accepted the
informational filing.

Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
In  connection  with the "safe  harbor"  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (Reform  Act),  Minnesota  Power is hereby filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
"forward-looking  statements" (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) of the
Company made by or on behalf of the Company  which are made  orally,  whether in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussion as to, expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use of words or phrases such as "will likely  result,"  "are expected to," "will
continue," "is  anticipated,"  "estimated,"  "projection,"  "outlook,")  are not
historical facts and may be forward-looking  and,  accordingly,  such statements
involve  estimates,  assumptions,  and  uncertainties  which could cause  actual
results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in the  forward-looking
statements.  Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by
reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors that could
cause the Company's actual results to differ  materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements of the Company made by or on behalf of the Company.

The Company  cautions  that the following  important  factors could cause actual
results  or  outcomes  to  differ   materially   from  those  expressed  in  any
forward-looking  statements  of the Company made by or on behalf of the Company.
Furthermore,  any forward-looking  statement speaks only as of the date on which
such statement is made,  and the Company  undertakes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on  which  such  statement  is made or to  reflect  the  occurrence  of
unanticipated  events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not
possible for  management to predict all of such  factors,  nor can it assess the
impact of each such factor on the Company's  business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Some  important  factors that could cause  actual  results or outcomes to differ
materially  from  those  discussed  in the  forward-looking  statements  include
prevailing  governmental policies and regulatory actions with respect to allowed
rates of return, industry and rate structure, acquisition and disposal of assets
and  facilities,  operation and  construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of
purchased  power,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail  competition
(including but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs).

The business and  profitability  of the Company are also  influenced by economic
and geographic  factors including  political and economic risks,  changes in and
compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies,  weather conditions,
population  growth rates and  demographic  patterns,  competition for retail and
wholesale  customers,  pricing and transportation of commodities,  market demand
for energy  from  plants or  facilities,  changes in tax rates or policies or in
rates of  inflation,  unanticipated  development  project  delays or changes in
project costs, unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital
expenditures,

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

capital market  conditions,  competition  for new energy development 
opportunities,  and legal and administrative  proceedings  (whether civil, such
as environmental, or criminal) and settlements.

All such  factors are  difficult  to predict,  contain  uncertainties  which may
materially affect results, and are beyond the control of the Company.
