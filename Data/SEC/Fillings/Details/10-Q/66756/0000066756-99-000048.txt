                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",
"expects",  "intends",  "plans",  "predicts",  "projects", "will likely result",
"will continue",  or similar expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and  may  be  forward-looking.  Forward-looking  statements  involve  estimates,
assumptions and  uncertainties  and are qualified in their entirety by reference
to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult
to predict, contain uncertainties, are beyond the control of the Company and may
cause   actual   results  to  differ   materially   from  those   contained   in
forward-looking  statements:

    - prevailing  governmental policies and regulatory actions, including
      those of the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC and the PSCW, with
      respect to allowed  rates of return,  industry and rate structure,
      acquisition  and  disposal  of assets  and  facilities, operation
      and  construction  of  plant  facilities,   recovery  of purchased
      power and other  capital  investments,  and present or prospective
      wholesale and retail  competition  (including  but not limited to
      retail wheeling and transmission costs);
    - economic and geographic factors including political and economic risks;
    - changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;
    - weather conditions;
    - population growth rates and demographic patterns;
    - competition for retail and wholesale customers;
    - Year 2000 issues;
      - delays or changes in costs of Year 2000 compliance;
      - failure of major suppliers, customers or others with whom the
        Company does business to resolve their own Year 2000 issues on
        a timely basis;
     - pricing and transportation of commodities;
     - market demand, including structural market changes;
     - changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
     - changes in project costs;
     - unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
     - capital market conditions;
     - competition for new energy development opportunities; and
     - legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or criminal)
       and settlements  that influence the business and  profitability  of
       the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

NOTE 3.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1995 RATE CASE.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1 million  annual
rate  increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers  of Florida
Water  regulated  by the FPSC.  In October  1996 the FPSC issued its final order
approving an $11.1 million annual  increase.  The new rates were  implemented in
September  1996.  In November  1996 Florida  Water filed with the Florida  First
District Court of Appeals (Court of Appeals) an appeal of the FPSC's final order
seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in
utility facilities recoverable in rates from current customers. Other parties to
the rate case also filed appeals. In the course of the appeals process, the FPSC
reconsidered an issue in its initial decision and, in June 1997, allowed Florida
Water to resume collecting  approximately $1 million, on an annual basis, in new
customer fees. In June 1998 the Court of Appeals ruled in Florida  Water's favor
on all material issues appealed by Florida Water and remanded the matter back to
the FPSC for action consistent with the Court's order. The Court of Appeals also
overturned  its decision in Florida  Water's 1991 Rate Case which had required a
"functional   relationship"   between   service  areas  as  a  precondition   to
implementation of uniform rates. In December 1998 the FPSC granted Florida Water
an additional  annual revenue increase of approximately  $1.2 million related to
several of the issues reversed by the Court of Appeals, and permitted collection
of  approximately  $2.4 million in  surcharges  to reimburse  Florida  Water for
revenue  (plus  interest)  wrongfully  denied in the FPSC's  October 1996 order.
Florida  Water  began  collecting  the new rates in  January  1999.  Intervenors
protested the surcharge  allocation  methodology.  As a result collection of the
surcharges  was  delayed  and  interest  accumulated  until the FPSC  approved a
methodology. The FPSC reopened the record on two remaining issues on remand from
the Court of Appeals  regarding the amount of  investment in utility  facilities
recoverable  in rates from current  customers.  On June 14, 1999  Florida  Water
filed a motion seeking approval of an offer of settlement which was heard by the
FPSC on August 23, 1999.  After Florida Water agreed to  modification of certain
terms of its offer  settlement,  on  September  14, 1999 the FPSC issued a final
order which increased  annual revenue by  approximately  $1 million;  authorized
Florida  Water to book  approximately  $8.5 million of  accumulated  surcharges,
including  interest  accrued through  September 30, 1999, as a regulatory  asset
recoverable  in base  rates  beginning  in the next rate  case;  and  provided a
three-year  moratorium  on the  initiation  of  rate  cases  by  Florida  Water,
exclusive of index filings which provide rate adjustments  based on inflationary
costs  associated  with  operation  and  maintenance  expenses.  The annual rate
increase of  approximately  $1 million  associated  with the  settlement  became
effective on October 1, 1999. In total,  the FPSC approved  $13.6 million of the
$18.1 million requested by Florida Water in the 1995 rate case.

1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Court of Appeals reversed a 1993 FPSC order
establishing  uniform  rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With
"uniform  rates" all  customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for
water and wastewater  services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order, in
August 1996 the FPSC ordered  Florida Water to issue refunds to those  customers
who paid more since  October 1993 under  uniform rates than they would have paid
under  stand-alone  rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge  to
customers who paid less under uniform  rates.  Florida Water  appealed,  and the
Court of  Appeals  ruled in June  1997 that the FPSC  could  not  order  refunds
without balancing  surcharges.  In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the
FPSC issued an order in January 1998 that did not require refunds.

In the same January 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund,  with
interest,  $2.5 million, the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service
area from January 1996 through June 1997 under uniform rates which  exceeded the
amount  these  customers  would  have paid  under a  modified  stand-alone  rate
structure.  No balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund
because  Spring  Hill  customers  continued  to pay  uniform  rates  after other
customers  began  paying  modified  stand-alone  rates  effective  January  1996
pursuant to the FPSC's interim rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case (see
Florida  Water 1995 Rate  Case).  The FPSC did not  include  Spring Hill in this
interim rate order because Hernando County had assumed  jurisdiction over Spring
Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida Water reached  agreement with Hernando County
to revert prospectively to stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund because the FPSC
had no  authority  to order  uniform  rates.  The Company has  appealed the $2.5
million refund order. Initial briefs were filed by all parties in May 1998.

NOTE 3.    REGULATORY MATTERS (Continued)

Upon  issuance of the June 1998  opinion of the Court of Appeals with respect to
Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case (see 1995 Rate Case) in which the court reversed
its previous ruling that the FPSC was without  authority to order uniform rates,
customer groups supporting the FPSC's January 1998 order filed a motion with the
Court of Appeals  seeking  dismissal  of the appeal by customer  groups  seeking
refunds.  Customers  seeking  refunds filed amended briefs in September  1998. A
provision  for refund  related to the $2.5 million  refund order was recorded in
the third  quarter  of 1999.  The  Company  is unable to  predict  the timing or
outcome of this matter.

ELECTRIC MPUC ORDERS.  On March 31, 1999 the Company made its annual filing with
the  MPUC  requesting  approval  for a 1998  year-end  Conservation  Improvement
Program (CIP) tracker  account  balance  (deferred  regulatory  charge) of $18.9
million;  recovery  from  customers in 1999 of $3.5 million of 1998 margins lost
due to approved conservation  improvement programs; and continuation of the 2.75
percent  billing  adjustment  factor.  On July 27, 1999 the MPUC issued an order
approving  the  Company's  CIP filing,  except for the  recovery of lost margins
which was  denied.  The  MPUC's  primary  rationale  for  denial of lost  margin
recovery was that in 1998  Electric  Operations  earned in excess of its allowed
return on equity.  In a companion order,  the MPUC opened an investigation  into
the reasonableness of Minnesota Power's rates.

In September  1999 the MPUC granted the Company's  request for rehearing of both
orders.  On September 9, 1999 the MPUC clarified the scope of its  investigation
into the reasonableness of the Company's rates and shortened the time period for
interested party comments.  On September 29, 1999 the Company filed the required
report with  respect to 1998 actual and 1999  projected  electric  earnings  and
explained why current  rates are just and  reasonable.  The Company  anticipates
that the MPUC will make a decision in 1999 whether further investigation will be
made into the reasonableness of Minnesota Power's rates. At the October 28, 1999
hearing regarding recovery of the Company's 1998 lost margins, the MPUC tabled a
final  decision  until early December 1999. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of these matters.


NOTE 4.    ACQUISITIONS

PALM COAST UTILITIES CORPORATION.  On January 22, 1999 Florida Water purchased
the assets and assumed certain liabilities of PCUC from ITT Industries, Inc. for
$16.8 million plus $1,000 per new water connection for an eight-year period. The
Company  estimates the present value of these future water  connections  at $5.1
million.  PCUC  provides  service  to  approximately  15,000  water  and  14,000
wastewater  customers in Flagler County,  Florida. The transaction was accounted
for using the  purchase  method.  Financial  results  have been  included in the
Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  since the date of purchase.  Pro
forma financial results have not been presented due to immateriality.

ADESA  AUCTION FACILITIES.  On April 30,  1999 ADESA  acquired  Des Moines Auto
Auction  located  in Des  Moines,  Iowa and on July 2, 1999 ADESA  Canada,  Inc.
purchased the Vancouver Auto Auction of New Westminster,  British Columbia.  The
two  transactions  had a  combined  purchase  price  of $31.3  million  and were
accounted  for using the  purchase  method and  resulted  in  goodwill  of $11.9
million  which will be amortized  over a 40 year period.  Financial  results for
each  facility  have  been  included  in the  Company's  consolidated  financial
statements since the date of purchase. Pro forma financial results have not been
presented  due to  immateriality.  The  33-acre  Des Moines  facility  has three
auction lanes and primarily  serves  consignment and fleet/lease  accounts.  AFC
provides  dealer  floorplan  financing at this  auction.  The 70-acre  Vancouver
facility has six auction lanes.  The purchase of the Vancouver  auction facility
is a major component of the Company's Canadian growth strategy.

MID SOUTH WATER SYSTEMS, INC. On June 17, 1999 Heater acquired the assets of Mid
South Water Systems,  Inc. (Mid South) located in Sherills Ford,  North Carolina
for $9 million.  The  acquisition  was accounted for using the purchase  method.

commercial  buildings.  Concurrently  with the  purchase,  Cape  Coral  Holdings
assigned to a third  party the rights to a shopping  center and a portion of the
vacant land for $8.8  million,  which  reduced the net amount paid by Cape Coral
Holdings to $36.2 million.  The transaction was accounted for using the purchase
method.  Financial  results  have been  included in the  Company's  consolidated
financial  statements  since the date of purchase.  Pro forma financial  results
have not been presented due to immateriality.


NOTE 5.    INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL RE

Minnesota Power owns 7.3 million shares, or 19.9 percent, of Capital Re. On June
10, 1999 Capital Re and ACE Limited (ACE) signed an agreement  providing for the
merger of  Capital  Re with ACE.  Under the terms of the  Agreement  and Plan of
Merger (Merger  Agreement),  Capital Re's  shareholders  would have received 0.6
ordinary  shares of ACE for each share of Capital  Re at  closing,  subject to a
maximum value to Capital Re shareholders of $22 per share.

On October 6, 1999 Capital Re received an unsolicited all-cash acquisition offer
from XL Capital Ltd. (XL Capital).  To consider XL Capital's  offer,  Capital Re
postponed  its  October 7, 1999  shareholder  meeting at which there was to be a
vote on the proposed  merger with ACE.  Capital Re has since  received  from ACE
proposed  amendments  to the  Merger  Agreement  and  competing  offers  from XL
Capital.

On October 26, 1999 Capital Re and ACE signed an amended merger agreement. Under
the terms of the amended agreement,  each Capital Re share will be exchanged for
0.65 ordinary shares of ACE plus cash, as needed,  to deliver an aggregate value
of $14 for each Capital Re share, as long as ACE's stock price is between $14.34
and $19.54 per share at  closing.  The amount of cash is subject to a minimum of
$1.30 per Capital Re share and a maximum of $4.68 per Capital Re share. If ACE's
stock  price is below  $14.34 per share or above  $19.54  per share,  Capital Re
shareholders  would  receive less value or more value,  respectively.  Minnesota
Power is unable to predict the timing of this transaction.

Minnesota Power's net income for nine months ended September 30, 1999 included a
$24.1 million  non-cash charge to income from equity  investments.  The non-cash
charge  reflected  an  estimated  Capital Re valuation of $17 per share based on
ACE's  stock  price at June 30,  1999 and the  exchange  ratio in the ACE Merger
Agreement.  As a  result  of  the  pending  merger  with  ACE,  Minnesota  Power
discontinued  the equity method of accounting  for its investment in Capital Re.
Minnesota  Power  currently  accounts  for its  investment  in  Capital Re as an
available-for-sale security with changes in value reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet.  Accordingly,  a $31.3 million
charge to  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss) was recorded on the
balance sheet during the third quarter of 1999 to reflect the September 30, 1999
Capital Re share price of $10.  Adjustments to Minnesota  Power's  investment in
Capital  Re will be  recognized  in net  income at the time a Capital  Re merger
transaction is finalized.  Assuming the  transaction is finalized  prior to year
end at a  value  of $14 per  share,  the  after-tax  loss of  $31.3  million  at
September 30, 1999 would be reduced by $17.7  million,  resulting in a charge to
fourth quarter net income of $13.6 million.

NOTE 8.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The  Company has had a power  purchase  agreement  with Square  Butte since 1977
which has  provided a long-term  supply of low-cost  energy to  customers in the
Company's  electric service territory and enabled the Company to meet power pool
reserve requirements. Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative corporation, owns
a 455-megawatt  coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center, North Dakota. The
Unit is adjacent to a generating unit owned by Minnkota Power Cooperative,  Inc.
(Minnkota),  a North Dakota  cooperative  corporation  whose Class A members are
also members of Square  Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of the Unit and
also purchases power from Square Butte.

In May 1998 the  Company  and Square  Butte  entered  into a new power  purchase
agreement (1998 Agreement),  replacing the 1977 agreement.  The Company extended
by 20  years,  to  January  1,  2027,  its  access to  Square  Butte's  low-cost
electricity  and  eliminated  its  unconditional  obligation  for all of  Square
Butte's  costs if not paid by Square  Butte  when due.  The 1998  Agreement  was
reached in conjunction with the termination of Square Butte's previous leveraged
lease financing arrangement and refinancing of associated debt.

Similar  to the  previous  agreement,  the  Company  is  initially  entitled  to
approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under the 1998  Agreement.  After
2005 and upon compliance with a two-year  advance notice  requirement,  Minnkota
has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a
minimum of 50 percent.

Under the 1998 Agreement,  the Company is obligated to pay its pro rata share of
Square  Butte's costs based on the  Company's  entitlement  to Unit output.  The
Company's  payment  obligation is suspended if Square Butte fails to deliver any
power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one year. Under the 1977
agreement the Company was unconditionally obligated to pay all of Square Butte's
costs,  if not paid by Square Butte when due. Square Butte's fixed costs consist
primarily of debt  service.  At  September  30, 1999 Square Butte had total debt
outstanding  of $343.1  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of the years 1999 through 2002
and $23  million in 2003.  Variable  operating  costs  include the price of coal
purchased  from BNI Coal, a subsidiary  of  Minnesota  Power,  under a long-term
contract. The Company's payments to Square Butte are approved as purchased power
expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


MINNESOTA  POWER is a  diversified  services  company  with  operations  in four
business  segments:  (1) Electric  Operations,  which  include  electric and gas
services, coal mining and telecommunications;  (2) Water Services, which include
water and wastewater services; (3) Automotive Services,  which include a network
of vehicle auctions,  a finance company, an auto transport company and a vehicle
remarketing company; and (4) Investments,  which include a securities portfolio,
intermediate-term  investments  and real estate  operations.  Corporate  Charges
represent  general  corporate  expenses,  including  interest,  not specifically
allocated to any one business segment.


CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW

Significant  growth in the  Company's  Automotive  Services  and Water  Services
segments  contributed to higher operating results in 1999. For the third quarter
of 1999,  net income  increased  34  percent  over 1998 and  earnings  per share
increased 28 percent over the prior period.  For the nine months ended September
30, 1999, the Company reported a $24.1 million  non-cash charge  associated with
the Company's  investment  in Capital Re.  Excluding  the non-cash  charge,  net
income for the nine months ended  September  30, 1999  increased 21 percent over
1998 and earnings per share increased 13 percent over the prior period. Earnings
per share in 1999  reflected the impact of the  additional 4.2 million shares of
Common  Stock  issued by the  Company  in an  underwritten  public  offering  in
September 1998.

NET INCOME

The  following  net  income  discussion  summarizes  significant  events for the
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1999.

Electric Operations  reflected higher margins from bulk power electric sales and
lower sales to large industrial customers in 1999.

Water Services  generated  higher net income in 1999 due to strategic  purchases
that increased the customer base by 23 percent, regulatory relief granted by the
FPSC in  settlement  of  Florida  Water's  1995  Rate  Case,  increased  average
consumption and management of operating costs.

Automotive   Services  showed   significant  growth  during  1999  reflecting  a
profitable mix of same-store  growth and selective  acquisitions.  The number of
vehicles offered for sale at ADESA auction facilities  increased 17 percent over
the third  quarter of 1998 (15 percent over the nine months ended  September 30,
1998).  Increased financing activity and the maturing of loan production offices
that opened in 1998 at AFC also contributed to higher net income from Automotive
Services.

Investments  reported  lower net income in 1999 primarily due to a $24.1 million
non-cash  charge that  reflected the estimated  valuation of the pending  merger
between Capital Re and ACE.

Minnesota Power owns 7.3 million shares, or 19.9 percent, of Capital Re. On June
10,  1999  Capital Re and ACE signed an  agreement  providing  for the merger of
Capital Re with ACE. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger
Agreement), Capital Re's shareholders would have received 0.6 ordinary shares of
ACE for each  share of  Capital Re at  closing,  subject  to a maximum  value to
Capital Re shareholders of $22 per share.

On October 6, 1999 Capital Re received an unsolicited all-cash acquisition offer
from XL Capital.  To consider  XL  Capital's  offer,  Capital Re  postponed  its
October  7,  1999  shareholder  meeting  at which  there was to be a vote on the
proposed  merger  with ACE.  Capital  Re has since  received  from ACE  proposed
amendments to the Merger Agreement and competing offers from XL Capital.

On October 26, 1999 Capital Re and ACE signed an amended merger agreement. Under
the terms of the amended agreement,  each Capital Re share will be exchanged for
0.65 ordinary shares of ACE plus cash, as needed,  to deliver an aggregate value
of $14 for each Capital Re share, as long as ACE's stock price is between $14.34
and $19.54 per share at closing. The amount of cash is subject to a minimum of
$1.30 per Capital Re share and a maximum of $4.68 per Capital Re share. If ACE's
stock price is below $14.34 per share or above $19.54 per share,  Capital Re
shareholders  would receive less value or more  value,  respectively.  Minnesota
Power is unable to predict the timing of this transaction.

The  non-cash  charge  included  in income  reflected  an  estimated  Capital Re
valuation  of $17 per share  based on ACE's stock price at June 30, 1999 and the
exchange  ratio in the ACE Merger  Agreement.  As a result of the pending merger
with ACE,  Minnesota Power  discontinued the equity method of accounting for its
investment in Capital Re. Minnesota Power currently  accounts for its investment
in Capital Re as an available-for-sale  security with changes in value reflected
in  accumulated  other  comprehensive   income  (loss)  on  the  balance  sheet.
Accordingly,  a $31.3 million charge to accumulated other  comprehensive  income
(loss) was  recorded on the balance  sheet  during the third  quarter of 1999 to
reflect the  September  30, 1999 Capital Re share price of $10.  Adjustments  to
Minnesota  Power's  investment in Capital Re will be recognized in net income at
the time a Capital Re merger transaction is finalized.  Assuming the transaction
is finalized  prior to year end at a value of $14 per share,  the after-tax loss
of $31.3  million at  September  30,  1999  would be  reduced by $17.7  million,
resulting in a charge to fourth quarter net income of $13.6 million.

Investments  also reflected lower net income because of stock market  volatility
affecting returns from short-term investments during 1999 and the discontinuance
of equity  accounting  for the Company's  investment in Capital Re. In addition,
1998 net  income  included  dividend  income  received  from a  venture  capital
investment and more large bulk land sales by Real Estate Operations.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 AND 1998

OPERATING REVENUE

Electric Operations  operating revenue was $8.0 million higher in 1999 primarily
due to a $22.4 million  increase from sales to other power suppliers  because of
extreme weather  conditions  affecting the power market during the third quarter
of 1999.  Temperatures,  which were at record highs during the last week of July
1999,  created  high demand for power from other power  suppliers.  Revenue from
industrial  customers was down $12.2  million in 1999 due to decreased  taconite
production, paper manufacturing and pipeline usage. Revenue from residential and
commercial  customers  was $1.1 million  higher in 1999 because of the unusually
hot weather in July 1999.  Revenue in 1998  reflected  $3.8  million of CIP lost
margin  recovery.  Total  retail  kilowatthour  sales were down 9.1 percent from
1998.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 1999 (16 percent in 1998).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 1999 (6 percent in 1998).  Sales to other power  suppliers  accounted  for 16
percent of consolidated operating revenue in 1999 (10 percent in 1998).

Water  Services  operating  revenue was $6.9 million  higher in 1999,  with $3.3
million of the increase  coming from PCUC which was  purchased in January  1999.
The remainder of the increase  resulted from  regulatory  relief  granted by the
FPSC in December 1998 and September  1999, and more  consumption due to customer
growth. Overall consumption increased 3 percent in 1999.

Automotive  Services  operating  revenue was $21.6 million higher in 1999 due to
stronger sales at ADESA auction facilities, and increased financing activity and
the maturing of loan production offices opened in 1998 by AFC. ADESA offered for
sale on  consignment  453,000  vehicles  (387,000  in  1998)  at its 29  auction
facilities in 1999 (28 in 1998). AFC financed  approximately 186,000 vehicles in
1999 (140,000 in 1998) through its 84 loan  production  offices.  AFC has had 84
loan  production  offices  since August 1998, 29 of which were opened during the
summer of 1998.

Investments  operating  revenue  was  $3.8  million  lower  in  1999.  Portfolio
operating  revenue was $2.6 million lower in 1999 due to stock market volatility
affecting  returns  from  short-term   investments.   The  Company's  securities
portfolio, excluding Capital Re shares, earned an annualized after-tax return of
4.3  percent in 1999 (7.2  percent in 1998).  Real Estate  Operations  operating
revenue was $6.4 million higher in 1999 because two large sales contributed $6.9
million.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Electric  Operations  operating  expenses  were  $2.0  million  higher  in  1999
primarily due to higher employee compensation and property taxes.

Water  Services  operating  expenses  were  $3.8  million  higher in 1999 due to
inclusion of PCUC and Mid South operations.

Automotive  Services  operating  expenses  were  $16.8  million  higher  in 1999
primarily  due to increased  sales  activity at the auction  facilities  and the
floorplan financing  business.  Additional expenses associated with more auction
facilities and loan  production  offices also  contributed to higher expenses in
1999.

Investments operating expenses were $2.5 million higher in 1999 primarily due to
the  inclusion  of Cape  Coral  operations  and two large  sales by Real  Estate
Operations.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS - NET OF TAX

Income  (loss) from equity  investments  - net of tax was $1.0 million  lower in
1999 primarily due to the  discontinuance of equity accounting for the Company's
investment in Capital Re. This decrease was partially  offset by $1.2 million of
equity income from investments in venture capital funds.

COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 AND 1998

OPERATING REVENUE

Electric  Operations  operating revenue was slightly higher in 1999.  Revenue in
1999  reflected a $22.2  million  increase  from sales to other power  suppliers
because of extreme  weather  conditions  affecting  the power market  during the
third quarter of 1999. Temperatures,  which were at record highs during the last
week of July 1999,  created a high demand for power from other power  suppliers.
Revenue  from  industrial  customers  was  down  $18.4  million  in 1999  due to
decreased taconite  production,  paper manufacturing and pipeline usage. Revenue
from  residential  and  commercial  customers  was $3.4  million  higher in 1999
because the winter  weather in northern  Minnesota and Wisconsin was colder than
1998 and  unusually  hot in July 1999.  Revenue in 1998 included $3.8 million of
CIP lost margin recovery.  Total retail kilowatthour sales were down 6.3 percent
from 1998.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 13 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 1999 (16 percent in 1998).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 1999 (6 percent in 1998).  Sales to other power  suppliers  accounted  for 10
percent of consolidated operating revenue in 1999 (8 percent in 1998).

Water Services  operating  revenue was $15.4 million  higher in 1999,  with $8.7
million of the increase  coming from PCUC which was  purchased in January  1999.
The remainder of the increase was attributed to regulatory relief granted by the
FPSC in December 1998 and September  1999, and more  consumption due to customer
growth.  Overall  consumption  increased  14  percent in 1999.  In 1998  overall
consumption  was lower than normal due to some of the  Company's  water  systems
being  adversely  impacted by record  rainfall  during the first quarter.  Gains
totaling  $600,000  from  the  sale of a water  system  and the  sale of land in
Florida were included in 1998 revenue.

Automotive  Services  operating  revenue was $60.9 million higher in 1999 due to
stronger sales at ADESA auction facilities, and increased financing activity and
the maturing of loan production offices opened in 1998 by AFC. ADESA offered for
sale on  consignment  1,277,000  vehicles  (1,115,000 in 1998) at its 29 auction
facilities  in 1999  (28 in  1998).  In 1999  ADESA  auction  financial  results
included a full nine months of operations from three vehicle  auctions  acquired
in late April and May 1998,  five months of  operations  from a vehicle  auction
acquired  in late April 1999 and three  months from a vehicle  auction  facility
acquired  in July 1999.  AFC  financed  approximately  508,000  vehicles in 1999
(393,000 in 1998) through its 84 loan  production  offices.  AFC has had 84 loan
production  offices since August 1998, 29 of which were opened during the summer
of 1998.

Investments  operating  revenue  was  $15.9  million  lower in  1999.  Portfolio
operating  revenue was $8.4 million lower in 1999 due to stock market volatility
affecting  returns  from  short-term   investments.   The  Company's  securities
portfolio, excluding Capital Re shares, earned an annualized after-tax return of
3.6 percent in 1999 (6.4 percent in 1998).  Also,  revenue in 1998 included $3.9
million of dividend  income  received from a venture  capital  investment.  Real
Estate Operations  operating revenue was $7.5 million lower in 1999 because 1998
included four large sales at Palm Coast and two large sales at Lehigh. Combined,
the six sales  contributed  $13.0  million to revenue in 1998. In 1999 two large
sales contributed $6.9 million to revenue. The remainder of the decrease was due
to normal fluctuations in Florida real estate sales.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Electric Operations operating expenses were $6.0 million lower in 1999 primarily
due to a $3.3 million  reduction in fuel and purchased power expenses because of
fewer  kilowatthour  sales and a $1.8 million  decrease in depreciation  expense
primarily the result of plant life extensions. Operating expenses were also $2.7
million lower in 1999 because the  amortization of an early  retirement  program
was completed in July 1998.

Water Services operating expenses were $8.6 million higher in 1999 primarily due
to inclusion of PCUC and Mid South operations.

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

Automotive  Services  operating  expenses  were  $44.8  million  higher  in 1999
primarily  due to increased  sales  activity at the auction  facilities  and the
floorplan financing  business.  Additional expenses associated with more auction
facilities and loan  production  offices also  contributed to higher expenses in
1999.

Investments  operating expenses were $3.3 million lower in 1999 primarily due to
fewer sales by Real Estate Operations.

Corporate  Charges  operating  expenses  were $7.3  million  lower in 1999.  The
decrease is partially  attributed to less  interest  expense in 1999 because the
average  commercial  paper  balance was lower.  Also,  interest  expense in 1998
reflected a settlement with the Internal  Revenue Service on tax issues relating
to prior years. As a result of the settlement, in the first quarter of 1998 $4.7
million  previously  accrued as income tax expense were reversed and recorded as
interest  expense.  There was no impact on  consolidated  net  income  from this
transaction.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS - NET OF TAX

Income  (loss) from equity  investments  - net of tax was $22.5 million lower in
1999  primarily  due to a $24.1  million  non-cash  charge  that  reflected  the
estimated  valuation of the pending merger  between  Capital Re and ACE, and the
discontinuance of equity accounting for the Company's  investment in Capital Re.
Equity income from  investments in venture capital funds was $1.4 million higher
in 1999.

OUTLOOK

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  On March 31, 1999 the Company made its annual filing with
the MPUC  requesting  approval for a 1998 year-end CIP tracker  account  balance
(deferred  regulatory charge) of $18.9 million;  recovery from customers in 1999
of $3.5 million of 1998 margins  lost due to approved  conservation  improvement
programs;  and continuation of the 2.75 percent billing  adjustment  factor.  On
July 27,  1999 the MPUC  issued an order  approving  the  Company's  CIP filing,
except for the recovery of lost  margins  which was denied.  The MPUC's  primary
rationale  for  denial  of lost  margin  recovery  was  that  in  1998  Electric
Operations  earned in excess of its  allowed  return on equity.  In a  companion
order, the MPUC opened an  investigation  into the  reasonableness  of Minnesota
Power's rates.

In September  1999 the MPUC granted the Company's  request for rehearing of both
orders.  On September 9, 1999 the MPUC clarified the scope of its  investigation
into the reasonableness of the Company's rates and shortened the time period for
interested party comments.  On September 29, 1999 the Company filed the required
report with  respect to 1998 actual and 1999  projected  electric  earnings  and
explained why current  rates are just and  reasonable.  The Company  anticipates
that the MPUC will make a decision in 1999 whether further investigation will be
made into the reasonableness of Minnesota Power's rates. At the October 28, 1999
hearing regarding recovery of the Company's 1998 lost margins, the MPUC tabled a
final  decision  until early December 1999. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of these matters.

CASH FLOW  ACTIVITIES.  Cash flow from  operations  during the nine months ended
September 30, 1999 reflected  improved  operating results and continued focus on
working capital management.  Cash from operating activities was also affected by
a number of factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 8 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA uses commercial paper issued
by the Company to meet short-term working capital  requirements arising from the
timing of payment  obligations to vehicle sellers and the  availability of funds
from vehicle purchasers. During the sales process, ADESA does not typically take
title to vehicles.

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

AFC also uses proceeds  from the sale of commercial  paper issued by the Company
to meet its operational  requirements.  AFC offers short-term  on-site financing
for dealers to purchase vehicles at auctions in exchange for a security interest
in those vehicles. The financing is provided through the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the vehicle or a general borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC sells
certain   finance   receivables  on  a  revolving   basis  to  a  wholly  owned,
unconsolidated,  qualified special purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn
sells,  on  a  revolving  basis,  an  undivided  interest  in  eligible  finance
receivables,  up to a maximum at any one time outstanding of $300.0 million,  to
third party  purchasers  under an agreement which expires at the end of 2002. At
September 30, 1999 AFC had sold $314.9  million of finance  receivables  to this
subsidiary  ($202.9  million at December 31, 1998).  Third party  purchasers had
purchased an undivided  interest in finance  receivables  of $224.0 million from
this  subsidiary  at September  30, 1999 ($170.0  million at December 31, 1998).
Proceeds from the sale of the receivables were used to repay borrowings from the
Company and fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
September  30, 1999  compared to December 31, 1998 were due to  increased  sales
activity by Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down during the
winter months and in December because of the holidays.  As a result,  both ADESA
and AFC had lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

Notes  payable  increased  temporarily  to  finance  Automotive  Services'  cash
requirements due to significant  auction sales and financing growth. The Company
also  used  the  temporary  increase  in notes  payable  and  proceeds  from the
September  1998  issuance of Common Stock to fund the January  1999  purchase of
PCUC.  Florida Water purchased the assets of PCUC from ITT Industries,  Inc. for
$16.8 million plus $1,000 per new water connection for an eight-year period. The
Company estimates the present value of these future water connections to be $5.1
million.

On April 30, 1999 ADESA acquired Des Moines Auto Auction  located in Des Moines,
Iowa and on July 2, 1999 ADESA Canada, Inc. purchased the Vancouver Auto Auction
of New  Westminster,  British  Columbia.  The two  transactions  had a  combined
purchase price of $31.3  million.  The Company  funded these  transactions  with
internally  generated  funds and notes  payable that are expected to be replaced
with long-term debt financing.

On June 17, 1999 Heater acquired the assets of Mid South of Sherills Ford, North
Carolina for $9 million.  The Company funded this  transaction  with  internally
generated funds and proceeds from a long-term revolving line of credit.

On June 30, 1999 Cape Coral  Holdings, Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of MP Real  Estate,
purchased,  for $36.2 million,  certain real estate  properties  located in Cape
Coral,  Florida,  from  subsidiaries  of Avatar Holdings Inc. The Company funded
this transaction  with internally  generated funds and proceeds from a long-term
revolving line of credit.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures  for the nine months
ended  September  30,  1999  totaled  $68.6  million  ($51.3  million  in 1998).
Expenditures  for 1999  included  $34.5 million for Electric  Operations,  $14.1
million for Water Services and $20.0 million for Automotive Services. Internally
generated  funds and proceeds from the  September  1998 issuance of Common Stock
were the primary sources of funding for these expenditures.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. (SFAS) 133, "Accounting
for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,"  as amended by SFAS 137,
effective for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be
recorded on the balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair
value.  SFAS  133  requires  that  changes  in the  derivative's  fair  value be
recognized  currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are
met. Special  accounting for qualifying  hedges allows a derivative's  gains and
losses to offset the related  results on the hedged item. The Company  currently
believes it has only a limited  amount of  derivative  activity  and adoption of
SFAS 133 is not expected to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial
position and results of  operations.

YEAR 2000.  The Year 2000 issue relates to computer  systems that  recognize the
year in a date field using only the last two digits. Unless corrected,  the Year
2000 may be interpreted as 1900, causing errors or shutdowns in computer systems
which may, in turn, disrupt operations.

STATE OF READINESS. The Company has been addressing the Year 2000 issue for over
five years.  In the ordinary course of business,  it has replaced,  or is in the
process of replacing,  many of its major computer  systems with new systems that
have been  designed to be Year 2000  compliant.  These  updated  systems  handle
critical aspects of the Company's  operations,  including energy  management and
generation  control  for  Electric  Operations,  and  customer  information  and
financial management Company-wide.

Each of the  business  segments  has its own  Year  2000  plan,  which  has been
reviewed and is being monitored by a  corporate-level  Year 2000 Risk Assessment
Team.  The  Company's  plan  for  Year  2000  readiness  involves  four  phases:
inventory,  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency  planning.  Testing is an
ongoing  and  integral  part  of the  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency
planning phases.

     INVENTORY.  Each business  segment has performed an extensive  inventory of
     its  information  technology  systems and other  systems  that use embedded
     microprocessors (collectively, "Systems"). The business processes supported
     by each System have been prioritized based on the degree of impact business
     operations would encounter if the System were disrupted.

     The inventory phase also includes  identifying  third parties with whom the
     Company  has  material  relationships.  The degree to which  each  business
     segment depends on third party support varies.  Water Services,  Automotive
     Services and Real Estate  Operations have  identified  minimal risk in most
     areas. Where a third party is critical to a business process,  efforts have
     been initiated to obtain Year 2000  compliance  information to identify the
     degree of risk exposure the Company may encounter.  Electric  Operations is
     working with its large power  customers to share Year 2000  information and
     determine their readiness. In addition, Electric Operations is working with
     its fuel and  transportation  providers  in an effort  to  ensure  adequate
     supplies of fuel.

     The  internal  inventory  phase was  substantially  completed in June 1998.
     Regular  contact  with third  parties  with whom the Company  has  material
     relationships will continue throughout 1999.

     EVALUATION.  This phase involves  computer program code review and testing,
     vendor contacts,  System testing and fully-integrated  System testing where
     practical.  The  objective  of this  phase is to  develop  and  update  the
     remediation  plan.  Some Systems,  upon  inspection,  are  determined to be
     non-compliant and are immediately placed on the remediation schedule.  Some
     Systems  require  testing to determine  compliance  status.  The evaluation
     phase was substantially complete in February 1999.

     REMEDIATION.  In this phase each System is either  fixed, replaced or
     removed. Critical Systems fixed or replaced are tested again for Year 2000
     readiness.

     The  electric  industry is unique in its  reliance on the  integrity of the
     power pool grid to support and  maintain  reliable,  efficient  operations.
     Preparation for the Year 2000 by Electric  Operations is linked to the Year
     2000 compliance efforts of other utilities as well as to those of its major
     customers  whose  loads  support  the  integrity  of the power  pool  grid.
     Electric  Operations is  coordinating  its Year 2000 efforts with the plans
     established by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) under
     the direction of the U.S. Department of Energy and is also working with the
     MAPP Year 2000 Task Force and a utility  industry  consortium to obtain and
     share utility-specific Year 2000 compliance information.

     As of November 5, 1999 the remediation phase for  mission-critical  systems
     within   Electric   Operations   was   complete.   As   defined   by  NERC,
     mission-critical  systems  are those  systems  that could be related to the
     loss  of  a  50-megawatt  or  larger  generation  source,  the  loss  of  a
     transmission  facility or the  interruption  of system load.  The Company's
     believes its mission-critical systems used to produce, deliver and transmit
     electricity are ready for date changes associated with Year 2000.

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

     The Company estimates that as of November 5, 1999 the remediation phase for
     all business  segment systems is approximately 91 percent complete based on
     the number of systems  remediated.  The bulk of the  remaining  systems are
     support systems within  Electric  Operations that are not mission critical.
     The remediation phase for the Company's other business segments was
     substantially complete in June 1999.

     CONTINGENCY PLANNING. Each business segment has developed contingency plans
     designed  to  continue   critical   processes  in  the  event  the  Company
     experiences Year 2000 disruptions  despite  remediation and testing.  These
     plans include establishment of internal  communications,  securing adequate
     on-site  supplies of certain  critical  materials and staffing for key Year
     2000 dates.  Contingency plans will also be tested when  appropriate.  Some
     contingency plans have already undergone testing.  The Company successfully
     participated  in both the April and September  1999 NERC drills.  The April
     1999 drill tested inter and intra  backup  communications  for the scenario
     that assumed 10 percent of voice and data communications had failed,  while
     the  September  1999 drill was a dress  rehearsal of staff  deployment  and
     backup  communication for the millennium  rollover.  As of November 5, 1999
     the Company  estimates the contingency  planning phase is  approximately 97
     percent complete.

COSTS. In the ordinary course of business over the last five years,  the Company
has replaced major business and operating computer systems. These systems should
require  minimal  remediation  efforts  because of their recent  implementation.
Formal Year 2000  readiness  plans were  established  in March 1998.  Since that
time,  the Company has  incurred  $3.8 million in expenses  primarily  for labor
associated  with  inventory,  evaluation and  remediation  efforts.  The Company
estimates its remaining costs to prepare for the Year 2000 will be approximately
$1.2  million,  some of which will be incurred  during the year 2000 for systems
not  critical to daily  operations.  Funds to address Year 2000 issues have been
provided  for in  the  Company's  existing  budgets.  These  costs  include  the
assignment of existing  personnel to Year 2000 projects,  maintenance and repair
expenses, and capitalized  improvements.  To date no critical projects have been
deferred  because of Year 2000 issues.  The Company does not anticipate that its
costs  associated with Year 2000 readiness will materially  impact the Company's
earnings in any year.

RISKS.  Based upon  information to date, the Company  believes that, in the most
reasonably likely worst-case scenario, Year 2000 issues could result in abnormal
operating   conditions,   such  as  short-term   interruption   of   generation,
transmission and distribution  functions within Electric Operations,  as well as
Company-wide loss of system monitoring and control functions,  and loss of voice
communications.  These  conditions,  along with power  outages  due to  possible
instability of regional electric  transmission  grids, could result in temporary
interruption of service to customers.  The Company  believes that it is unlikely
that our customers will experience any  interruption to their electric  service.
The Company  does not believe the overall  impact of this  scenario  will have a
material impact on its financial  condition or operations due to the anticipated
short-term nature of interruptions.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's  securities portfolio has exposure to both price and interest rate
risk.  Investments held principally for near-term sale are classified as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies,  with utilities being the largest
industry  sector.  Investments  held  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time  are
classified as available-for-sale securities and also recorded at fair value. The
available-for-sale  securities  portfolio  consists  primarily of the  preferred
stock of utilities and financial institutions with investment grade debt ratings
and Capital Re shares. (See Note 5 to the consolidated  financial  statements in
Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.)

In strategies  designed to reduce  market risks,  the Company sells common stock
short and enters into short sales of treasury futures contracts.  Selling common
stock short is intended to reduce price risks  associated with securities in the
Company's trading securities portfolio.  The stock sold short consists primarily
of the stock of companies in similar industries.  Treasury futures are used as a
hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks  associated  with holding  fixed  dividend
preferred  stocks  included  in  the  Company's  available-for-sale   securities
portfolio. Generally, treasury futures contracts mature in 90 days.

Fourth Paragraphs

Steel  imports  continue  to be a  critical  issue  facing  the  American  steel
industry. Total imports for the first eight months of 1999 were 23.3 million net
tons of steel,  8.2 percent higher than the same period in 1997, the last record
year prior to the  unprecedented  import  surge of 1998.  The surge of  imported
steel in recent  years  continues  to  depress  average  prices  for steel  mill
products.  Prices for 1999  continue to be off about 25 percent  compared to the
same period in 1998. In 1998 the United States imported a record 42 million tons
of steel,  which  represented  an 83 percent  increase  over the 23  million-ton
average for each of the previous eight years (1990-1997).

Domestic  production  for the first  eight  months of 1999 was 68.3  million net
tons, down some 4 percent from the same period in 1998. Capacity utilization for
the industry  during that same period was 81.5  percent,  down from 90.0 percent
from the same period in 1998.  The continued  lower  worldwide  demand for steel
produced  in  the  United  States  is  having  an  adverse  affect  on  northern
Minnesota's taconite producers and the economy of northern Minnesota in general.
The  Company  is unable to  predict  the  eventual  impact of this  issue on the
Company's Electric Operations.

In September 1999 the MPUC granted the Company's request for  reconsideration of
the July 27, 1999 orders which  denied the  recovery of lost margins  related to
CIP and opened an investigation  into the  reasonableness  of Minnesota  Power's
rates.  On September 9, 1999 the MPUC  clarified the scope of its  investigation
into the reasonableness of the Company's rates and shortened the time period for
interested party comments.  On September 29, 1999 the Company filed the required
report with  respect to 1998 actual and 1999  projected  electric  earnings  and
explained why current  rates are just and  reasonable.  The Company  anticipates
that the MPUC will make a decision in 1999 whether further investigation will be
made into the reasonableness of Minnesota Power's rates. At the October 28, 1999
hearing regarding recovery of the Company's 1998 lost margins, the MPUC tabled a
final  decision  until early December 1999. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of these matters.

1995 RATE CASE.  After Florida Water agreed to  modification of certain terms of
its June 14, 1999 offer of  settlement,  on September 14, 1999 the FPSC issued a
final  order with  respect to Florida  Water's  1995 rate case.  The final order
increased annual revenue by approximately $1 million;  authorized  Florida Water
to book approximately $8.5 million of accumulated surcharges, including interest
accrued through  September 30, 1999, as a regulatory  asset  recoverable in base
rates  beginning in the next rate case; and provided a three-year  moratorium on
the initiation of rate cases by Florida Water,  exclusive of index filings which
provide rate adjustments  based on inflationary  costs associated with operation
and maintenance  expenses.  The annual rate increase of approximately $1 million
associated  with the settlement  became  effective on October 1, 1999. In total,
the FPSC approved $13.6 million of the $18.1 million  requested by Florida Water
in the 1995 rate case.

facility in Calgary,  Alberta, Canada. The new facility is expected to occupy 25
of the 65 acres acquired. Opening is scheduled in the spring of 2000.

On October 6, 1999 Capital Re received an unsolicited all-cash acquisition offer
from XL Capital.  To consider  XL  Capital's  offer,  Capital Re  postponed  its
October  7,  1999  shareholder  meeting  at which  there was to be a vote on the
proposed  merger  with ACE.  Capital  Re has since  received  from ACE  proposed
amendments to the June 10, 1999 Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger  Agreement)
and competing offers from XL Capital.

On October  21,  1999 ACE filed a lawsuit in  Delaware  Chancery  Court  against
Capital Re alleging that Capital Re breached its existing Merger  Agreement with
ACE by, among other things, entering into negotiations with XL Capital. ACE also
sought a temporary  restraining order to prevent Capital Re from terminating its
existing  Merger  Agreement  until ACE's  claims can be decided by the  Delaware
court. This temporary restraining order was denied on October 25, 1999.

On October 26, 1999 Capital Re and ACE signed an amended merger agreement. Under
the terms of the amended agreement,  each Capital Re share will be exchanged for
0.65 ordinary shares of ACE plus cash, as needed,  to deliver an aggregate value
of $14 for each Capital Re share, as long as ACE's stock price is between $14.34
and $19.54 per share at  closing.  The amount of cash is subject to a minimum of
$1.30 per Capital Re share and a maximum of $4.68 per Capital Re share. If ACE's
stock  price is below  $14.34 per share or above  $19.54  per share,  Capital Re
shareholders  would  receive less value or more value,  respectively.  Minnesota
Power is unable to predict the timing of this transaction.

         2.3 Receivable. The definition of "Receivable" in Exhibit I to the
Agreement is amended in its entirety as follows:

             "'Receivable'  means any  right to  payment  from any  Person,

         intangible,  arising from the providing of financing and other services
         by the Originator to new, used and wholesale  automobile or other motor

following definitions in the appropriate alphabetical order:

         practices in the United States, consistently applied."

             "Tangible  Net Worth" means,  with respect to any Person,  the net
         worth of such  Person  calculated  in  accordance  with GAAP  after
         subtracting  therefrom the aggregate amount of such Person's intangible
         assets, including, without limitation,  goodwill, franchises, licenses,
         patents, trademarks,  tradenames,  copyrights,  service marks and brand
         names and capitalized software."

             "Tractor  Receivable" means, those Receivables  generated as a
         result of the making of loans to finance the purchase of Tractors.

         manufactured  with a minimum of two axles and a maximum of three  axles
         intended  primarily for use on the public  streets,  roads and highways
         and designed to operate in  combination  with a semitrailer or trailer;
         provided,   further,   this   definition   specifically   excludes  any

         the  performance  or  observance of any  obligation  or condition  with
         respect to such Debt if the effect of such default is to accelerate the
         maturity  of  any  such  Debt  and  the  Debt  with  respect  to  which
         non-payment and/or  non-performance shall have occurred exceeds, at any

         were true and correct as of such earlier date).

             (b)  Enforceability.  The  execution and delivery by such Person of
         this  Amendment,  and the  performance  of its  obligations  under this
         Amendment  and  the  Agreement,  as  amended  hereby,  are  within  its

         6.  Counterparts.  This  Amendment  may be  executed  in any  number of
counterparts  and by  different  parties  on  separate  counterparts,  and  each
counterpart shall be deemed to be an original,  and all such counterparts  shall
together constitute but one and the same instrument.

         7.  Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Indiana without  reference
to conflict of laws principles.

         8.  Section  Headings.  The  various  headings  of this  Amendment  are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation
of this amendment or the Agreement or any provision hereof or thereof.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the parties have executed this Amendment as of the

         This FOURTH  AMENDMENT  (this  "Amendment"),  dated as of September 22,
1999, is among AFC Funding  Corporation,  an Indiana corporation (the "Seller"),
Automotive Finance Corporation, an Indiana corporation (the "Servicer"),  POOLED

"Purchaser"),  and NESBITT BURNS SECURITIES,  INC., a Delaware  Corporation,  as
Agent for Purchaser (in such capacity, the "Agent").

                                    RECITALS

         1.  The Seller, the Servicer, the Purchaser and the Agent are parties
to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 31, 1996 (as amended
by the First Amendment dated as of February 28, 1997; the Second Amendment dated
as of August 15, 1997;  and the Third  Amendment  dated as of October 30, 1998,

         2.  The Seller,  the Servicer,  the  Purchaser, and the Agent desire to
amend the Agreement as hereinafter set forth.

         NOW, THEREFORE,  for good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

         SECTION 1. Amendments to the Agreement. The Agreement is hereby amended
as follows:

         1.1 The definition of "Purchase Limit" in Exhibit I to the Agreement is
hereby  amended by  substituting  "$300,000,000"  for  "$225,000,000"  where the
latter appears in that definition.

         1.2 The definition of "Termination  Date" in Exhibit I to the Agreement
is hereby  amended by  substituting  "December 30, 2002" for "December 31, 2001"
where the latter appears in that definition.

         1.3 The  definition of "Loss  Percentage" in Exhibit I to the Agreement
is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

             "Loss  Percentage"  means, on any date, the greatest of (i) 4 times
         the  highest  Delinquency  Ratio  during the 12 calendar  months  ended
         immediately preceding such date, (ii) the Loss Reserve Ratio, and (iii)
         12%.

<PAGE>

         1.4 The  definition  of "Net  Spread" in Exhibit I to the  Agreement is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

             "Net  Spread'  means  the  annualized  percentage  equivalent  of a
         fraction  (computed  as of the last day of each  calendar  month),  the
         numerator  of which is the excess of (x) all  Finance  Charge and Floor
         Plan Fee  Collections  received and applied  during such calendar month
         (including  recoveries) over (y) the sum of, without  duplication,  (i)
         the Carry Costs for such calendar month,  (ii) the aggregate  amount of
         Receivables  that became  Defaulted  Receivables  during such  calendar
         month, (iii) the Outstanding Balance of Pool Receivables that have been
         or, consistent with the Credit and Collection Policy,  should have been
         written off the Seller's  books as  uncollectible  during such calendar
         month  (but  excluding  any  Receivables  that  were  included  in  the
         calculation of Net Spread pursuant to clause (ii) above in any previous
         calendar month), and (iv) the aggregate amount of non-cash  adjustments
         that reduced the Outstanding Balance of any Pool Receivable during such
         calendar month (but  excluding any Receivable  that was included in the
         calculation of Net Spread pursuant to clause (ii) above in any previous
         calendar month);  and the denominator of which is the average aggregate
         Outstanding  Balances  of the Pool  Receivables  during  such  calendar
         month."

         1.5 Clause  (viii) of paragraph  (l) of Exhibit IV to the  Agreement is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                "(viii) such other  information respecting   the   Receivables
         (including  a  Portfolio  Certificate  on a more  frequent  basis  than
         provided  in clause  (iii)  above),  the  Related  Security  (including
         inventory reports by branch,  obligor,  vehicle  identification number,
         and other descriptions  sufficient to identify the Related Security) or
         the condition of operations,  financial or otherwise,  of the Seller or
         AFC as the Agent may from time to time reasonably request;"

         SECTION 2.  Conditions to Effectiveness.

         2.1 This  Amendment  shall  become  effective  on the date  hereof upon
receipt by the Agent of the  following,  each duly  executed and dated as of the
date  hereof  (or  such  other  date  satisfactory  to the  Agent),  in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agent:

             (a)  counterparts  of  this  Amendment  (whether  by  facsimile  or
         otherwise) executed by each of the parties hereto;

             (b) a written  statement from Moody's Investors  Service,  Inc. and
         Standard & Poor's that this Amendment will not result in a downgrade or
         withdrawal of the rating of the Notes; and

             (c)  such  other   documents  and  instruments  as  the  Agent  may
         reasonably request.

                                      -2-
