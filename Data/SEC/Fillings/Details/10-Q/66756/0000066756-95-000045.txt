Note 3. Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. 
Under the terms of the contract which extends through 2007, the Company is 
purchasing 71 percent of the output from a generating plant which is capable of 
generating up to 455 MW. Reductions to about 49 percent of the output are 
provided for in the contract and, at the option of Square Butte, could begin 
after a five-year advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power and energy is a proportionate share of Square Butte's 
fixed obligations and variable operating costs, based on the percentage of the 
total output purchased by the Company. The annual fixed obligations of the 
Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1995 through 1999. The variable 
operating costs are not incurred unless production takes place. The Company is 
responsible for paying all costs and expenses of Square Butte if not paid by 
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company 
are absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered 
to the Company.

In March 1995 based on the results of a project which analyzed the economic 
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the 
board of directors of Lehigh directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of 
Lehigh's assets in a manner that would maximize utilization of tax benefits. 
With this new directive in place, Lehigh recognized $18.4 million of income in 
the first quarter of 1995 by reducing a portion of the valuation reserve that 
offsets the deferred tax assets. The Company's portion of that income is $14.7 
million, or 52 cents per share.

Note 5. Discontinued Operations

On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its interest in the paper and pulp 
business to CPI for $118 million in cash, plus CPI's assumption of certain debt 
and lease obligations. The Company is still committed to a maximum guaranty of 
$90 million to ensure a portion of LSPI's $33.4 million annual lease obligation 
for equipment under an operating lease extending to 2012. However, CPI has 
agreed to indemnify the Company for any payments the Company may make as a 
result of the Company's existing obligation relating to the LSPI operating 
lease. The sale price is subject to adjustment upon completion of audits of the 
paper and pulp business.

The financial results of the paper and pulp business including the loss on 
disposition have been accounted for as discontinued operations.

Note 6.   Subsequent Event

Effective July 1, 1995, Minnesota Power became an 80 percent owner of ADESA for 
$167 million in cash. ADESA, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, owns and 
operates auto redistribution facilities and performs related services through 
which used cars and other vehicles are sold to franchised automobile dealers 
and licensed used car dealers. Sellers at ADESA's auctions include domestic and 
foreign auto manufacturers, car dealers, fleet/lease companies, banks and 
finance companies. Proceeds from the sale of the paper and pulp business 
combined with proceeds from the sale of securities investments were used to 
fund the purchase of ADESA.

In February 1995 the Company signed a merger agreement with ADESA, as well as, 
employment agreements and put and call agreements with ADESA's four top 
managers. The put and call agreements provide ADESA management the right to 
sell to Minnesota Power, and Minnesota Power the right to purchase, ADESA 
management's 20 percent retained ownership interest in ADESA, in increments 
during the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, at a price based on ADESA's financial 
performance.

Pro forma financial statements reflecting the acquisition of ADESA and 
financial statements of ADESA for the interim period ended June 30, 1995, will 
be filed as an amendment to the Company's Form 8-K filed July 12, 1995. The 
amendment will be filed on or before September 8, 1995, pursuant to Form 8-K, 
Item 7. instructions.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
          Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota Power has operations in four business areas: (1) electric utility 
operations, which include electric, gas and coal mining operations; (2) water 
utility operations, which include water, wastewater and sanitation services; 
(3) investments and corporate services, which include a financial guaranty 
reinsurance company, a real estate company in Florida and investments in 
securities; and (4) an auto redistribution business that was acquired July 1, 
1995. 

Earnings per share of common stock for the quarter ended June 30, 1995, were 40 
cents compared to 44 cents for the quarter ended June 30, 1994. Lower earnings 
in 1995 are attributed to higher expenses due to scheduled maintenance in 
electric utility operations and lower consumption levels and sales in water 
utility operations. However, earnings from the portfolio, reinsurance business, 
and paper and pulp business improved substantially in 1995. A single large 
commercial land sale contributed to 1994 real estate results.

Earnings per share of common stock for the six months ended June 30, 1995, were 
$1.27 compared to 74 cents for the quarter ended June 30, 1994. The most 
significant factor contributing to the higher earnings in 1995 was the 
recognition of tax benefits associated with Lehigh which contributed 52 cents 
to earnings per share. Earnings in 1995 also reflect the improved performance 
of the Company's securities portfolio, higher paper and pulp prices, and 
increased electric sales to industrial customers offset in part by lower water 
consumption levels at SSU and an 18 cent per share provision associated with 
exiting the truck-mounted lifting equipment business. Earnings in 1994 include 
13 cents per share from the recognition of escrow funds associated with Lehigh 
and a 21 cent per share write-off of an investment.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Quarter Ended June 30, 1995 and 1994.

Electric utility operations. Operating revenue and income from electric utility 
operations were higher in 1995 compared to 1994 primarily because of a 15 
percent increase in kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers. National 
resumed operations in August 1994 and required significantly more amounts of 
electricity in 1995. Overall electric sales increased 7 percent. Fuel and 
purchased power expenses were higher in 1995 due to increased demand for 
electricity. Operations included higher scheduled maintenance costs and 
customer service expenses. Coal operations contributed net income of $732,000 
in 1995 and $761,000 in 1994 to electric utility operations.

Revenue from electric sales to taconite customers accounted for 36 percent of 
revenue and income from electric utility operations in 1995 compared to 34 
percent in 1994. Revenue from electric sales to paper and other wood products 
companies accounted for 13 percent of revenue and income from electric utility 
operations in 1995 compared to 14 percent in 1994. 

Water utility operations. Revenue and income from water utility operations were 
down in 1995 due in part to reduced irrigation demand and the December 1994 
sale of SSU's Venice Gardens assets. It is expected that the loss of customers 
as a result of the Venice Gardens transaction will be offset when the purchase 
of Orange Osceola Utilities, Inc. is complete. The transaction is expected to 
occur in the third quarter of 1995. 

In June 1995 SSU filed a request with the FPSC for an $18.1 million annual 
increase in rates. Interim rates of $12.4 million are expected to be in effect 
in October 1995 and will be subject to refund with interest.

Investments and corporate services. In 1995 improved market conditions enhanced 
the portfolio and reinsurance business results. A single large commercial land 
sale contributed to 1994 real estate results.

Discontinued operations. Operating results of the paper and pulp business as 
well as the disposition of that business have been included in discontinued 
operations. Significantly higher paper and pulp prices increased earnings in 
1995.

Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 1995 and 1994.

Electric utility operations. Operating revenue and income from electric utility 
operations were higher in 1995 compared to 1994 due to interim rates in effect 
since March 1, 1994, and a 13 percent increase in kilowatt-hour sales to 
industrial customers due to National resuming operations in August 1994. 
Overall electric sales increased 4 percent. Coal operations contributed $1.4 
million and $1.3 million of net income in 1995 and 1994, respectively, to 
electric utility operations.

Revenue from electric sales to taconite customers accounted for 37 percent of 
revenue and income from electric utility operations in 1995 compared to 33 
percent in 1994. Revenue from electric sales to paper and other wood products 
companies accounted for 13 percent of revenue and income from electric utility 
operations in 1995 compared to 14 percent in 1994. 

Water utility operations. Operating revenue and income from water utility 
operations were down in 1995 due in part to reduced irrigation demand and the 
December 1994 sale of SSU's Venice Gardens assets. It is expected that the loss 
of customers as a result of the Venice 

                                   -10-
<PAGE>
Gardens transaction will be offset when the purchase of Orange Osceola 
Utilities, Inc. is completed. The transaction is expected to occur in the third 
quarter of 1995. 

Investments and corporate services. Earnings from investments and corporate 
services were higher in 1995 primarily due to the recognition of $18.4 million 
of tax benefits by Lehigh, the Company's real estate business. In March 1995 
based on the results of a project which analyzed the economic feasibility of 
realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board of directors 
of Lehigh directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's assets in a 
manner that would maximize utilization of tax benefits. The Company's portion 
of the tax benefits reflected as income is $14.7 million, or 52 cents per 
share. Earnings in 1994 include 13 cents per share from the recognition of 
escrow funds associated with Lehigh.

The performance of the Company's securities portfolio improved significantly 
over 1994 due to improved market conditions. In the first quarter of 1994 the 
Company wrote off a $10.1 million investment. In March 1995, the Company 
recorded a $5 million provision, lowering earnings per share by 18 cents in 
anticipation of exiting Reach All. It is expected that the liquidation of Reach 
All will be completed during third quarter 1995.

Discontinued operations. Operating results of the paper and pulp business as 
well as the disposition of that business have been included in discontinued 
operations. Significantly higher paper and pulp prices increased earnings in 
1995.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Reference is made to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six 
months ended June 30, 1995 and 1994, for purposes of the following discussion.

Cash flow activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number 
of factors representative of normal operations.

Cash from investing activities included proceeds from the sale of the paper and 
pulp business and proceeds from the sale of a portion of the securities 
portfolio. The majority of these proceeds were placed in cash and cash 
equivalents to repay notes payable issued in anticipation of the ADESA 
acquisition closing on July 1, 1995.

Cash from financing activities increased due to the issuance of notes payable 
to temporarily finance the ADESA acquisition on July 1, 1995. The proceeds from 
these notes payable were held in trust until July 3, 1995.

Working capital, if and when needed, generally is provided by the sale of 
commercial paper. In addition, securities investments can be liquidated to 
provide funds for reinvestment in existing businesses or acquisition of new 
businesses, and approximately 900,000 original issue shares of common stock are 
available for issuance through the DRIP.

ADESA's auctions finance a substantial amount of their working capital needs 
with accounts payable due to sellers for vehicles sold at the auctions. 
Typically, ADESA is paid immediately when an automobile is auctioned and title 
is delivered. In certain instances, a seller does not have physical possession 
of the title when a car is auctioned. In such instances, when ADESA receives 
the title, it then pays the seller and submits a bill to the buyer, resulting 
in a short-term need for borrowings. ADESA delivers title for the vehicle 
against payment therefor. ADESA also pays automobile manufacturers for vehicles 
sold at factory sales which requires short-term working capital until the 
buyers' checks have cleared.

                                   -11-

<PAGE>
ADESA also offers short-term on-site financing for dealers to purchase 
automobiles at auctions in exchange for a security interest in those 
automobiles. The financing is provided through the earlier of the date the 
dealer sells the automobile or a general borrowing term of 30-60 days. As a 
result, ADESA has a $40 million revolving line of credit to meet its short-term 
operational requirements.

Capital requirements. Consolidated capital expenditures for the six months 
ended June 30, 1995, totaled $38 million. These expenditures include $23.1 
million for electric utility operations, of which $5.6 million was for coal 
operations, $14.2 million for water utility operations and $700,000 for the 
pulp production plant. Internally generated funds were the primary source for 
funding these expenditures.

The construction forecast for the remainder of 1995 was revised following the 
sale of the paper and pulp business and the July 1, 1995, purchase of ADESA. 
Total 1995 capital expenditures are expected to be $120 million which include 
$51 million for the relocation and development of auto auction sites. 
Internally generated funds and a $52 million revolving line of credit at ADESA 
are expected to finance the majority of the expenditures.

The Company's compliance filing was filed on March 27, 1995, with the MPUC. In 
an order dated May 31, 1995, the MPUC approved the filing with the exception of 
the Company's refunding plan. Final rates were implemented for sales on and 
after June 1, 1995. The Company proposed different refund levels by rate class 
based on the final rate design ordered. The MPUC ordered equal rate refund 
levels by class and on June 30, 1995, five Firm Large Power Customers requested 
reconsideration. The MPUC denied this request in an August 1, 1995 order. The 
date of refund will be delayed until at least mid-September, depending on
