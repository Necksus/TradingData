                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",
"expects",  "intends",  "plans",  "predicts",  "projects", "will likely result",
"will continue",  or similar expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and  may  be  forward-looking.  Forward-looking  statements  involve  estimates,
assumptions,  and uncertainties and are qualified in their entirety by reference
to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult
to predict, contain uncertainties, are beyond the control of the Company and may
cause   actual   results  to  differ   materially   from  those   contained   in
forward-looking statements:

            - prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including
              those of the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC and the PSCW, with
              respect to allowed rates of return,  industry and rate  structure,
              acquisition and disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation and
              construction of plant facilities,  recovery of purchased power and
              other capital  investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale
              and  retail  competition  (including  but not  limited  to  retail
              wheeling and transmission costs);

            - economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
              risks;

            - changes in and compliance with  environmental  and safety laws and
              policies;

            - weather  conditions;

            - population growth rates and demographic patterns;

            - competition  for  retail  and  wholesale  customers;

            - pricing  and   transportation   of  commodities;

            - market demand, including structural market changes;

            - changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

            - changes  in project  costs;

            - unanticipated   changes  in   operating   expenses   and   capital
              expenditures;

            - capital market conditions;

            - competition for new energy  development  opportunities;  and

            - legal and administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or criminal)
              and settlements  that influence the business and  profitability of
              the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Florida First  District Court
of Appeals (Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform
rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With  "uniform  rates," all
customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and  wastewater
services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
ordered  Florida Water to issue  refunds to those  customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge to  customers  who paid
less under uniform rates. Florida Water appealed, and the Court of Appeals ruled
in June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without balancing surcharges.
In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC issued an order on January
26, 1998 that would not require  Florida  Water to refund  about $12.5  million,
which included interest,  to customers who paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 26, 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund
$2.5 million, the amount paid by customers  in the Spring Hill service area from
January  1996 through June 1997 under  uniform  rates which  exceeded the amount
these customers would have paid under a modified stand-alone rate structure.  No
balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund because Spring
Hill customers continued to pay uniform rates after other customers began paying
modified stand-alone rates effective January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's interim
rate order in Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case.  The FPSC did not include  Spring
Hill in this interim rate order because Hernando County had assumed jurisdiction
over Spring Hill's rates.  In June 1997 Florida Water reached an agreement  with
Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to stand-alone  rates for Spring Hill
customers.

Customer groups which paid more under uniform rates have appealed the FPSC's
January 26, 1998 order.  The Company has appealed the $2.5 million refund
order.  No  provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The  Company is unable to
predict the timing or outcome of the appeals  process.

FLORIDA WATER 1995 RATE CASE.  Florida  Water  requested an $18.1  million rate
increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers of Florida  Water
regulated by the FPSC. In October 1996 the FPSC issued its final order approving
an $11.1 million annual increase.  In November 1996 Florida Water filed with the
Court of Appeals an appeal of the FPSC's final order seeking  judicial review of
issues relating to the amount of investment in utility facilities recoverable in
rates from current customers. Other parties to the rate case also filed appeals.
In June 1997, as part of the review  process,  the FPSC allowed Florida Water to
resume collecting  approximately $1 million, on an annual basis, in new customer
connection  fees.  Oral  arguments  on the  appeals  were  heard by the Court of
Appeals on  February  10,  1998.  The Company is unable to predict the timing or
outcome of the appeals process.

HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY RATES.  On July 2,  1997  Florida  Water  filed  with  the
Hillsborough  County  Utilities  Department  a  request  for an  annual  interim
increase of $848,845 in annual revenue and a final increase of $877,607. Interim
rates became effective on August 18, 1997.  Hearings began in April 1998 and are
expected to continue in June and July 1998. It is  anticipated  that final rates
will be  implemented  in the third  quarter  of 1998.  The  Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this case.

NORTH CAROLINA UTILITIES COMMISSION. On September 30, 1997 Heater filed with the
NCUC for a $1.1 million annual increase for its water and wastewater  customers.
The  hearing  was held on March 10,  1998.  On March 16, 1998 the NCUC issued an
order  authorizing a rate increase of $343,000 pending the issuance of the final
order.  The test year was  adjusted  for  post-test  year  customer  growth  and
consumption which substantially  decreased the annual rate increase required.  A
final order from the NCUC is expected in May 1998.


NOTE 3.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the  quarter  ended  March 31,  1998  total  comprehensive  income was $18.1
million  ($14.1  million for the quarter ended March 31, 1997).  The  difference
between total comprehensive income and net income was primarily unrealized gains
and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale.

NOTE 5.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. Under
the terms of the contract which extends  through 2007, the Company is purchasing
about 71 percent of the output from a 455 MW  generating  plant.  Reductions  to
about 49 percent of the output are  provided  for in the  contract  and,  at the
option of Square  Butte,  could begin after a  five-year  advance  notice to the
Company.

The cost of the power  and  energy is a  proportionate  share of Square  Butte's
fixed obligations and variable  operating costs,  based on the percentage of the
total  output  purchased by the Company.  The annual  fixed  obligations  of the
Company to Square Butte are $17.2 million from 1998 through  2002.  The variable
operating costs are not incurred unless  production  takes place. The Company is
responsible  for paying all costs and  expenses  of Square  Butte if not paid by
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company are
absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered to the
Company.

Electric  Operations  reported  lower  electric and gas retail sales due to mild
weather,  and additional operating and purchased power expenses incurred because
of scheduled maintenance shutdowns at major generating facilities. The scheduled
maintenance  helps  position the Company to meet  electric  demand in the coming
summer.  Water Services  showed  improvement  in spite of record  rainfall which
resulted  in a 12 percent  reduction  in  consumption.  In 1997  Water  Services
performance was negatively  affected by a loss incurred by a non-regulated water
subsidiary.  Automotive  Services  reflected  a 14 percent  increase  in vehicle
sales, and the expansion and maturing of recently opened loan production offices
in the floorplan financing business. In 1997 Automotive Services included a gain
on the  sale  of an  auction  facility.  Investments  included  dividend  income
received  from an  investment  and two  large  bulk  land  sales by real  estate
operations in 1998.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  Operating revenue and income from Electric Operations were
$2.5 million  higher in 1998  primarily  because of a $4.9  million  increase in
sales to other power suppliers.  Demand revenue from large industrial  customers
was lower in 1998 as a result of negotiated  contract  extensions.  Kilowatthour
sales in total were up about 2 percent. The mild weather in 1998 caused electric
sales to  residential  customers  to decline 9 percent  which in turn  decreased
revenue  about $1.3 million from those  customers.  Gas sales at SWL&P were also
$1.6 million lower  primarily due to the mild weather.  In 1997 the Company sold
rights  to  microwave  frequencies  in  accordance  with a federal  mandate  and
recognized  a $0.8  million  pre-tax  gain in the first  quarter of 1997.  Total
operating  expenses  were  $6.7  million  higher  in 1998 due to a $5.7  million
increase in fuel and purchased  power  expense.  Increased  sales to other power
suppliers and a major  scheduled  maintenance  shutdown at Square Butte required
the  Company to  purchase  35 percent  more  power from other  power  suppliers.
Scheduled  maintenance at a Company generating facility also increased operating
expenses in 1998. Scheduled maintenance will continue into the second quarter of
1998.  Property  taxes were $1.1 million  lower in 1998 due to the reform of the
Minnesota  property tax system in mid-1997.  Income tax expense was $1.4 million
lower in 1998 because of lower operating income.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 32 percent of
electric operating revenue and income in 1998 and 1997.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 11 percent of electric operating revenue and income
in 1998 (12 percent in 1997).  Sales to other power  suppliers  accounted for 11
percent of electric operating revenue and income in 1998 (7 percent in 1997).

WATER  SERVICES.  Operating  revenue  and income from Water  Services  were $0.2
million  higher  in 1998  due to  increased  revenue  from  non-regulated  water
subsidiaries  and  income  earned on  proceeds  from the  December  1997 sale of
certain water and wastewater assets to Orange County, Florida. Operating revenue
and income from regulated water  subsidiaries were lower in 1998 because of a 12
percent  reduction  in  consumption  due to  record  rainfall.  Total  operating
expenses were $0.4 million  lower in 1998 due  primarily to fewer  expenses as a
result of the sale of assets to Orange County,  Florida.  Operating  expenses in
1997  reflected  start-up costs incurred by  non-regulated  water  subsidiaries.
Income  tax  expense  was $0.3  million  higher  in 1998  because  of  increased
operating income.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  Operating revenue and income from Automotive Services were
$16.2 million  higher in 1998 due primarily to a 14 percent  increase in vehicle
sales,  and the expansion and maturing of AFC loan production  offices opened in
1997 and early 1998.  ADESA sold 214,000  vehicles in 1998 (188,000 in 1997). In
1997  operating  revenue and income  included a gain from the sale of an auction
facility.  Total  operating  expenses  were up $12.2  million  primarily  due to
expenses  associated  with  increased  vehicle  sales and the  expansion  of the
floorplan financing business. Income tax expense was $1.8 million higher in 1998
because of increased operating income.

INVESTMENTS.

   - SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO AND  REINSURANCE.  Operating  revenue and income were
     $2.4 million higher in 1998 due to $3.9 million of dividend income received
     from a venture capital  investment.  Income from equity investment included
     $4.2 million in 1998 ($4.0 million in 1997) from the  Company's  investment
     in Capital Re. Together,  the Company's securities portfolio and its equity
     investment  in  Capital  Re earned an  annualized  after-tax  return of 5.8
     percent in 1998 (10.1 percent in 1997). Income tax expense was $1.0 million
     higher in 1998 because of increased operating income.

   - REAL  ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Operating  revenue  and income  from Real Estate
     Operations  were $3.3  million  higher  in 1998 due to two large  bulk land
     sales at Palm Coast.  Combined,  the two sales  contributed $5.1 million to
     revenue in 1998.  Operating revenue and income in 1998 also reflected fewer
     lot sales compared to 1997 and less interest income because of the maturing
     receivable   portfolio.   Total  operating  expenses   (excluding  minority
     interest) were $0.4 million higher in 1998 due to expenses  associated with
     the two bulk land sales. Income tax expense was $1.0 million higher in 1998
     because of increased operating income.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

CASH FLOW  ACTIVITIES.  Cash  flow from  operations  improved  during  the first
quarter of 1998 due to enhanced  management of working  capital  throughout  the
Company. Cash from operating activities was also affected by a number of factors
representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 4 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle  purchasers.  However,  ADESA utilizes commercial paper
issued by the Company to meet short-term  working capital  requirements  arising
from the timing of payment  obligations to vehicle sellers and the  availability
of funds  from  vehicle  purchasers.  During the sales  process,  ADESA does not
typically take title to vehicles.

AFC also uses  commercial  paper  issued by the Company to meet its  operational
requirements.  AFC offers  short-term  on-site financing for dealers to purchase
vehicles   at  auctions  in  exchange  for  a  security   interest  in  those
vehicles.  The  financing  is  provided  through  the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the  vehicle  or a general  borrowing  term of 30 - 90 days.  At
March 31, 1998 AFC had sold $150.0 million ($124.0 million at December 31, 1997)
of  receivables  on a  revolving  basis  to a third  party  purchaser.  Under an
agreement,  the purchaser agrees to purchase up to $225.0 million of receivables
on a revolving  basis.  Proceeds from the sale of the  receivables  were used to
repay  borrowings  from the Company and fund vehicle inventory  purchases for
AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
March 31,  1998  compared  to  December  31,  1997 were due to  increased  sales
activity by Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down during the
winter months and in December because of the holidays.  As a result,  both ADESA
and AFC had lower  receivables and fewer payables at year end. 

On or  around  May 8,  1998  the  Company  plans  to file a  shelf  registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to 3.0 million  original issue shares of
Common Stock. After the registration  statement becomes  effective,  the Company
expects to sell the  registered  Common  Stock from time to time as warranted by
market conditions and the Company's capital requirements.  The offer and sale of
such shares shall be made only by means of a prospectus.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the three months
ended March 31, 1998 totaled $16.5 million ($15.1 million in 1997). Expenditures
for 1998 include $9.2  million for Electric  Operations,  $3.0 million for Water
Services and $4.3 million for Automotive  Services.  Internally  generated funds
were the primary source for funding these expenditures.
