NOTE 2.   REGULATORY MATTERS

FPSC REFUND ORDER IN  CONNECTION  WITH 1991 RATE CASE.  Responding  to a Florida
Supreme Court  decision  addressing  the issue of  retroactive  ratemaking  with
respect to another  company,  in March  1996 the FPSC  voted to  reconsider  its
October 1995 order (Refund Order) which  required  Florida Water to refund about
$15 million,  which includes interest,  to customers who paid more since October
1993 under  uniform  rates than they  would have paid under  stand-alone  rates.
Under the Refund Order,  the  collection  through a surcharge of the $15 million
from customers who paid less under uniform rates was not  permitted.  The Refund
Order was in response to the Florida First  District  Court of Appeals (Court of
Appeals)  reversal  in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order which  imposed  uniform
rates for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in  Florida.  With  "uniform
rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the same rates for water and
wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative to  "stand-alone"  rates
which are  calculated  based on the cost of serving each service area.  The FPSC
reconsidered  the  Refund  Order,  but in August  1996 the FPSC  issued an order
upholding  by a 3 to 2 vote its  decision to order  refunds  without  offsetting
surcharges and required  Florida Water to implement a modified  stand-alone rate
structure.

On June 17, 1997 the Court of Appeals reversed the FPSC's August 1996 order. The
Court of Appeals  determined  that the FPSC's order directing the refund without
permitting  an  offsetting  surcharge  was not  permissible  because  it did not
comport  with  principles  of  equity or with  existing  Florida  Supreme  Court
precedent.  The  Court  of  Appeals  remanded  the  matter  back to the FPSC for
reconsideration,  and  directed the FPSC to consider  requests for  intervention
from the various  customer  groups  impacted  by any  potential  surcharges.  On
October 7, 1997 the FPSC voted to provide notice to Florida Water's customers of
the  potential  refund or surcharge  and to require all parties to submit briefs
concerning  refund and  surcharge  issues by November 5, 1997.  The issues to be
considered on remand relate to rate design and do not involve any  adjustment to
Florida Water's revenue requirement.

In July 1997,  after the Court of Appeals  remanded the Refund Order back to the
FPSC,  Spring Hill  customers in Hernando  County filed a petition with the FPSC
requesting that Florida Water be ordered to refund $2.5 million, the amount paid
by the Spring  Hill  service  area from  January  1996  through  June 1997 under
uniform rates (established by the FPSC in the 1991 Rate Case) which is in excess
of the  amount  which  would have been paid under  modified  stand-alone  rates.
Because  Hernando  County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring  Hill's  rates,
Spring Hill was not included as part of Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case in which
the FPSC  ordered  interim  rates  effective  January  1996  based  on  modified
stand-alone  rates.  The  Company  has not  recorded a  provision  for refund in
connection with this matter and is unable to predict its outcome.

FLORIDA  WATER'S 1995 RATE CASE.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1 million rate
increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers of Florida  Water
regulated  by the FPSC.  On October  30,  1996 the FPSC  issued its final  order
(October 1996 Order) in the Florida Water rate case. The new rates, which became
effective  as of  September  20,  1996,  resulted in an  annualized  increase in
revenue of approximately $11.1 million.  This increase included,  and was not in
addition to, the $7.9 million increase in annualized  revenue granted as interim
rates  effective on January 23,  1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate  structure
called "capband," which replaces uniform rates.  With capband rates,  areas with
similar cost of service are grouped into one of a number of rate bands,  and all
customers  within a given band are charged the same rate. This rate structure is
designed so that a  customer's  bill will not exceed a certain  "cap" unless the
customer's  usage  exceeds an assumed  level.  On November 1, 1996 Florida Water
filed  with the Court of Appeals an appeal of the  FPSC's  final  order  seeking
judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in  utility
facilities  recoverable  in rates from current  customers.  Other parties to the
rate case also  filed  appeals  with the Court of Appeals  regarding  the FPSC's
final order.

Effective June 13, 1997 Florida Water resumed collecting  pre-existing Allowance
for Funds Prudently  Invested (AFPI) charges.  AFPI represents the carrying cost
of certain non-used and useful property excluded from rate base and is collected
as a one-time charge to certain new water and wastewater customers. The recovery
of AFPI  charges  for  certain  Florida  Water  service  areas  was  reduced  or
eliminated  in the FPSC's  October  1996 final order issued in  connection  with
Florida  Water's  1995 rate  case.  In April  1997 the FPSC,  acting on  Florida
Water's  motion,  reversed its previous  decision and again allowed  recovery of
pre-existing  AFPI  charges  for these  service  areas,  subject to refund  with
interest in

NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

the event of an adverse court ruling in the appeal of the 1995 rate case. In its
answer brief filed in the Court of Appeals on August 21, 1997 the FPSC  conceded
that its  treatment of AFPI in its October 1996 Order was in error and requested
the Court of Appeals to remand the AFPI issue to the FPSC for final disposition.
Florida Water estimates  approximately $1 million,  on an annual basis,  will be
collected and accounted for as deferred revenue pending results of the appeal.

The  appeal  process  in the 1995  Rate  Case may take as long as  another  nine
months. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

HERNANDO COUNTY RATES. As required by Hernando County, on April 14, 1997 Florida
Water filed for an annual  rate  increase of  $123,897  (1.6  percent)  with the
Hernando  County  Board of  Commissioners.  On June 14,  1997 the  final  rate
increase Florida Water requested became effective  automatically by operation of
law  because  Hernando  County  failed to take  action on the rates  within  the
prescribed statutory period.

In July 1997 Florida Water reached a settlement  agreement with Hernando  County
regarding the rate case Florida Water filed in April 1997.  Under the settlement
agreement,  new rates  became  effective  September  1, 1997 and are expected to
result in $6.3 million of revenue on an annual  basis,  a $1.6 million  decrease
from the  revenue  levels  implemented  on June 14,  1997.  Rates  will  then be
increased  January  1, 1999 to result in $7.2  million  in  revenue on an annual
basis.  Florida Water also agreed not to file for new rates with Hernando County
prior to September 2000.

HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY RATES. On July 2, 1997 Florida Water filed for a rate change
with the Hillsborough  County Utilities  Department.  Florida Water filed for an
annual  interim  rate  increase  of  $848,845  (43.1  percent)  and a final rate
increase of $877,607 (44.6  percent).  Interim rates became  effective on August
18, 1997.  Final rates are anticipated in the first quarter of 1998. The Company
is unable to predict the outcome of this case.

NORTH CAROLINA UTILITIES COMMISSION. On September 30, 1997 Heater filed with the
NCUC for a $1.1 million annual increase for its water and wastewater  customers.
Hearings are expected to occur in March 1998 with a final order  anticipated  in
May 1998. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this case.



NOTE 3.   SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. Under
the terms of the contract which extends  through 2007, the Company is purchasing
71 percent of the output from a generating  plant which is capable of generating
up to 470 MW.  Reductions  to about 49 percent of the output are provided for in
the contract and, at the option of Square  Butte,  could begin after a five-year
advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power  and  energy is a  proportionate  share of Square  Butte's
fixed obligations and variable  operating costs,  based on the percentage of the
total  output  purchased by the Company.  The annual  fixed  obligations  of the
Company to Square Butte are $20.1 million from 1997 through  2001.  The variable
operating costs are not incurred unless  production  takes place. The Company is
responsible  for paying all costs and  expenses  of Square  Butte if not paid by
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company are
absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered to the
Company.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MINNESOTA  POWER  has  operations  in  four  business  segments:   (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
services,  which include water and wastewater services; (3) automotive services,
which include auctions, a finance company and an auto transport company; and (4)
investments,   which  include  a  securities  portfolio,  a  21  percent  equity
investment  in  a  financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and  real  estate
operations.

EARNINGS PER SHARE of common stock for the quarter ended September 30, 1997 were
73 cents compared to 58 cents for the quarter ended September 30, 1996. Electric
operations  and  automotive  services  were the primary  contributors  to higher
earnings  in  1997.  As in  1996,  earnings  from  electric  operations  in 1997
reflected strong demand for electricity by the Company's  industrial  customers.
Higher  earnings from electric  operations also reflected  increased  margins on
MPEX's  sales  to  other  power  suppliers,  the  sale of  rights  to  microwave
frequencies  and  property  tax relief from the State of  Minnesota.  Automotive
services  earnings are higher due to a 34 percent increase in the number of cars
sold at  ADESA's  auctions  and  the  expansion  of  AFC's  floorplan  financing
business.

Earnings per share of common stock for the nine months ended  September 30, 1997
were $1.85  compared  to $1.68 for the nine months  ended  September  30,  1996.
Earnings in 1997 reflect a significant  increase in automotive services due to a
30  percent  increase  in the number of cars sold at  ADESA's  auctions  and the
expansion of AFC's floorplan  financing  business.  1997 earnings also reflect a
solid  performance from electric  operations and water services,  and consistent
performance,  net of one-time  adjustments in 1996, by the investments  segment.
Corporate  charges and other reflect increased debt service costs as a result of
the higher balance of commercial  paper in 1997 and nine months of distributions
with respect to the Cumulative  Quarterly Income Preferred  Securities issued in
March  1996.  In 1996  water  services  included  a gain  from the sale of water
assets,  portfolio and  reinsurance  included a one-time tax benefit from an IRS
audit  adjustment,  and real estate included the recognition of tax benefits and
the sale of a joint venture.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL COMPARISON
QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 AND 1996.

OPERATING  REVENUE AND INCOME for 1997 was up $31  million  (14.4  percent)  due
primarily to an increase in the number of cars sold at ADESA's  auctions,  AFC's
floorplan  financing  business  and  increased  real estate  sales.  As in 1996,
electric  operations  in 1997  reflected  strong demand for  electricity  by the
Company's  industrial  customers  and  significant  MPEX  sales to  other  power
suppliers due to high demand during the summer  months.  Electric  operations in
1997 also included  proceeds from the Company's  sale of its rights to microwave
frequencies.

                                     - 9 -

<PAGE>


FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER were up $0.7 million (1.4 percent) in 1997 because of a
2.4 percent  increase  in  generation  at the  Company's  coal fired  generating
stations and higher prices for purchased power. The price of purchased power was
substantially  higher  per  megawatthour  because  of  competitive  pricing  and
additional  transmission  fees  assessed  for the  delivery of power  within the
Midwest.

OPERATIONS  EXPENSES  were up $12.4  million (9.6  percent) in 1997  reflecting
increased sales activity in automotive services and real estate.

INTEREST EXPENSE was down in 1997 due to lower interest rates on debt refinanced
during 1997.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  was  significantly  higher in 1997 due to the $18.6  million
increase in operating  income and the recognition of a $4 million tax benefit by
Lehigh in 1996.


CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL COMPARISON
NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 AND 1996.

OPERATING  REVENUE  AND  INCOME was up $72.4  million  (11.6  percent)  in 1997,
primarily  due to the addition of ADESA's nine new auction  sites and  increased
sales  at  existing  ADESA  auctions.  Electric  operations  in  1997  reflected
continued  strong demand for electricity by the Company's  industrial  customers
and MPEX sales to other power suppliers. In addition,  proceeds from the sale by
electric  operations of microwave  frequencies and river land added to operating
revenue and income.  Revenue  from water  services was higher in 1997 because of
increased  rates approved by the FPSC effective in September  1996. The increase
was partially offset by lower revenue following the sale of two water systems by
Heater in March  and  December  1996.  The March  1996 sale  resulted  in a $1.1
million  pre-tax  gain.  The  increase  in  operating  revenue  and income  from
investments  reflected a $7.1 million  (34.3  percent)  increase in real estate
sales.

OPERATIONS  EXPENSES were up $42.2 million (11.2  percent) in 1997. The increase
is due primarily to increased  sales  activity in  automotive  services and real
estate.

INTEREST  EXPENSE  was higher in 1997 due  primarily  to more  commercial  paper
issued.

DISTRIBUTIONS  ON REDEEMABLE  PREFERRED  SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY were higher in
1997  because  the  securities  were  outstanding  for the nine  months  in 1997
compared to less than seven months in 1996.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  was  significantly  higher in 1997 due to the $27.9  million
increase in operating  income and the recognition of a $6 million tax benefit by
Lehigh in 1996.


BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARISON
QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 AND 1996.

ELECTRIC  OPERATIONS.  Operating  revenue  and income was up 5.1 percent in 1997
which  reflected  strong  demand for  electricity  by the  Company's  industrial
customers and proceeds from the sale of rights to microwave  frequencies.  Total
kilowatthour  sales (down 9.2 percent)  reflected a 25 percent decrease in sales
for resale by MPEX.  MPEX sales were lower  because less power was available and
prices  were  higher.  While  total  revenue  from MPEX sales was lower in 1997,
higher profit margins were realized on these sales.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 29 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1997  compared  to 32 percent in 1996.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 11 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1997 and 1996.  Sales to other  power  suppliers
accounted  for 15 percent of electric  operating  revenue in 1997 compared to 17
percent in 1996.

Total  electric  operating  expenses  increased  only $1.2 million in 1997.  The
increase  included a $0.7 million  increase in fuel and purchased power due to a
2.4 percent  increase  in  generation  at the  Company's  coal-fired  generating
stations and higher prices for purchased  power.  Recent reform of the Minnesota
property  tax  system  reduced  operating  expenses  in  1997.

                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>



WATER  SERVICES. Operating  revenue and income from water  services was higher
in 1997  primarily due to Florida  Water's  implementation  of final  rates in
September  1996 and additional  customers in Florida and North  Carolina.
Operating  expenses  were higher  due  to  start-up  costs  associated with the
Company's   unregulated subsidiaries, ISI and Americas' Water.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES.  Operating  revenue and income was $14.9 million higher in
1997 due primarily to increased sales at ADESA auction sites. ADESA sold 203,000
cars in 1997 compared to 151,000 in 1996.  Growth of AFC's  floorplan  financing
business and increased  transport  business also  increased  revenue and income.
Operating  expenses were higher in 1997 because of increased  sales  activity at
ADESA. The expansion of AFC's floorplan  financing business also contributed to
higher operating expenses.

INVESTMENTS.

   - SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO AND  REINSURANCE.  The Company's  securities
     portfolio  and  reinsurance  continued to perform well in 1997 as in 1996.

   - REAL ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Revenue was up in 1997 as a result of additional
     sales of properties at Lehigh and Palm Coast. Net income in 1996 included
     the recognition of $4 million of tax benefits at Lehigh.


BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARISON
NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 AND 1996.

ELECTRIC  OPERATIONS.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations was
up slightly in 1997.  Electric  operations in 1997  reflected  continued  strong
demand for electricity by the Company's  industrial  customers and MPEX sales to
other  power  suppliers.  In  addition,  proceeds  from  the sale of  rights  to
microwave  frequencies  and the sale of  river  land to the  State of  Minnesota
offset a  decline  in  revenue  resulting  from an 8 percent  decrease  in total
kilowatthour  sales. The decrease is attributable to a decline in sales to other
power suppliers due to less power available for resale. Less power was available
because of higher prices for purchased power,  various  generating unit outages,
reduction in  transmission  capability  damaged by severe  spring  storms in the
Midwest and less hydro generation in Canada.  The decrease in kilowatthour sales
was  partially  offset by an increase in sales to paper  customers  because of a
higher demand for paper.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 31 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1997 and 32 percent in 1996.  Electric  sales to
paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 12 percent of electric
operating revenue in 1997 and 11 percent in 1996. Sales to other power suppliers
accounted  for 12 percent of electric  operating  revenue in 1997 compared to 14
percent in 1996.

Total electric  operating expenses decreased by $4 million in 1997. The decrease
is primarily  attributable to lower fuel and purchased power expenses because of
reduced  kilowatthour  sales and lower  property taxes due to the 1997 reform of
the Minnesota  property tax system.  Lower interest  charges also contributed to
the cost reductions in 1997 operating expenses.

WATER SERVICES.  Operating  revenue and income from water services was higher in
1997  primarily  because of  increased  rates  approved  by the FPSC in 1996 for
Florida  Water  customers.  The increase was  partially  offset by lower revenue
following  the sale of two water  systems by Heater in March and December  1996.
The March 1996 sale resulted in a $1.1 million pre-tax gain.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES.  Operating  revenue and income was $54.9 million higher in
1997 due primarily to increased sales at ADESA auction sites. ADESA sold 594,000
cars in 1997 compared to 456,000 in 1996.  Growth of AFC's  floorplan  financing
business, increased transport business and a gain on the sale of an auction also
increased revenue and income.  Operating expenses were higher in 1997 because of
increased  sales  activity  at  ADESA  auction  sites.  The  expansion  of AFC's
floorplan financing business also contributed to higher operating expenses.

INVESTMENTS.

  -  SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE.  The Company's securities portfolio
     and  reinsurance  earned an  annualized  after-tax return of 8.1 percent in
     1997 compared to 9 percent in 1996. A one-time tax benefit for an IRS audit
     adjustment was included in 1996.

  -  REAL ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Revenue  was up in 1997  compared to 1996 due to
     increased  sales at Lehigh and Palm Coast.  1996 included $3.7 million from
     the sale of Lehigh's joint venture  investment in a resort and golf course.
     The April 1996  acquisition of Palm Coast increased 1997 operating  revenue
     and expenses.  Net income in 1996 included the recognition of $6 million of
     tax benefits at Lehigh.

Reference  is made to the  Consolidated  Statement  of Cash  Flows  for the nine
months  ended  September  30,  1997 and  1996,  for  purposes  of the  following
discussion.

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES.  Cash from operating activities was affected by a number
of factors  representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 4 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

AFC sold $50 million of  receivables to a third party  purchaser  during 1997, a
total of $100  million  since  December  1996.  Under the  terms of a  five-year
agreement  amended in August 1997, the purchaser  agrees to purchase  additional
receivables aggregating $225 million, at any one time outstanding, to the extent
that such  purchases  are supported by eligible  receivables.  Proceeds from the
sale of the receivables  were used to repay borrowings from the Company and fund
car inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

In June 1997 Minnesota  Power  refinanced $10 million of industrial  development
revenue  bonds and $29 million of  pollution  control  bonds with $39 million of
Variable  Rate Demand  Revenue  Refunding  Bonds  Series 1997A due June 1, 2020,
Series  1997B and Series 1997C due June 1, 2013 and Series 1997D due December 1,
2007.  A total of $36.5  million of the  transaction  was  completed in June and
July.  The remaining  $2.5 million of the  refinancing  was completed in October
1997. In May 1997 MP Water  Resources' $30 million 10.44% long-term note payable
was refinanced with $24 million of Florida  Water's First Mortgage Bonds,  8.01%
Series due May 30, 2017 and $6 million of internally generated funds.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures  for the nine months
ended September 30, 1997 totaled $46.6 million compared to $76.6 million for the
same period in 1996.  Expenditures  in 1997 include  $23.8  million for electric
operations,  $14.9  million for water  services and $7.9 million for  automotive
services. Internally generated funds were the primary source for funding capital
expenditures.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 (SFAS 130), "Reporting  Comprehensive Net
Income",  effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. SFAS 130
establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a
full set of general  purpose  financial  statements.  SFAS 130 will  require the
Company to report a total for comprehensive  income which includes,  among other
things,  unrealized  holding  gains  and  losses  on  securities  classified  as
available-for-sale  under SFAS 115,  "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities" and foreign currency  translation  adjustments  accounted
for under SFAS 52, "Foreign Currency Translation".

Also in June 1997 the FASB issued SFAS 131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,"  effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1997. SFAS 131 requires the reporting of certain  information about
operating segments of an enterprise.  The Company believes that it is already in
compliance with SFAS 131 in all material respects.

In  February  1997 the FASB  issued SFAS 128,  "Earnings  per  Share."  SFAS 128
addresses the  computation  and  disclosure of earnings per share amounts when a
company  has stock  options,  awards,  warrants  and/or  convertible  securities
outstanding.  SFAS 128 is effective for periods  ending after December 15, 1997
and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company upon adoption.

Ref. 8-K dated June 23, 1997, Page 1 - Fourth Paragraph

FLORIDA  WATER'S  1995 RATE  CASE.  In April  1997 the FPSC,  acting on  Florida
Water's  motion,  reversed its previous  decision and again allowed  recovery of
pre-existing  AFPI charges for certain  Florida Water service areas,  subject to
refund with  interest in the event of an adverse  court  ruling in the appeal of
the 1995 rate case.  In its answer brief filed in the Court of Appeals on August
21, 1997 the FPSC  conceded that its treatment of AFPI in its October 1996 Order
was in error and  requested the Court of Appeals to remand the AFPI issue to the
FPSC for final disposition. Florida Water estimates approximately $1 million, on
an annual basis, will be collected and accounted for as deferred revenue pending
results of the appeal.

The  appeal  process  in the 1995  Rate  Case may take as long as  another  nine
months. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

Ref. Page 14. - First Paragraph
Ref. 8-K dated June 23, 1997, Page 1 - Second Paragraph

FPSC REFUND ORDER IN CONNECTION WITH 1991 RATE CASE. On October 7, 1997 the FPSC
voted to provide notice to Florida Water's  customers of the potential refund or
surcharge  and to require all  parties to submit  briefs  concerning  refund and
surcharge  issues by November  5, 1997.  The issues to be  considered  on remand
relate to rate  design and do not  involve  any  adjustment  to Florida  Water's
revenue requirement.

In July 1997,  after the Court of Appeals  remanded the Refund Order back to the
FPSC,  Spring Hill  customers in Hernando  County filed a petition with the FPSC
requesting that Florida Water be ordered to refund $2.5 million, the amount paid
by the Spring  Hill  service  area from  January  1996  through  June 1997 under
uniform rates (established by the FPSC in the 1991 Rate Case) which is in excess
of the  amount  which  would have been paid under  modified  stand-alone  rates.
Because  Hernando  County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring  Hill's  rates,
Spring Hill was not included as part of Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case in which
the FPSC  ordered  interim  rates  effective  January  1996  based  on  modified
stand-alone  rates.  The  Company  has not  recorded a  provision  for refund in
connection with this matter and is unable to predict its outcome.

NORTH CAROLINA UTILITIES COMMISSION

On  September  30, 1997  Heater  filed with the NCUC for a $1.1  million  annual
increase for its water and wastewater customers.  Hearings are expected to occur
in March 1998 with a final order  anticipated in May 1998. The Company is unable
to predict the outcome of this case.

With respect to the DOJ's complaint in a civil action in the U.S. District Court
for the Middle District of Florida  (District Court)  regarding  Florida Water's
alleged violation of effluent  limitations in the National  Pollutant  Discharge
Elimination  System  permits  occurring  at the  University  Shores and Seaboard
wastewater  facilities  from  February  1992  through  March  1994,  a trial  is
anticipated to begin in mid-1998. The District Court has established a discovery
deadline of January 15, 1998 for all  parties.  At this time,  Florida  Water is
continuing  to pursue  settlement  as well as  prepare  for trial in the event a
reasonable settlement cannot be reached.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",   "estimates",  "expects",
"intends",   "plans",  "predicts",   "projects",  "will  likely  result",  "will
continue",  or similar  expressions)  are not statements of historical facts and
may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:
(i) prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those of
the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the SCPSC and the PSCW,  with respect to
allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal
of assets and  facilities,  operation,  and  construction  of plant  facilities,
recovery of purchased  power,  and present or  prospective  wholesale and retail
competition  (including  but not  limited to retail  wheeling  and  transmission
costs);  (ii) economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
risks;  (iii) changes in and compliance with  environmental  and safety laws and
policies;  (iv) weather conditions;  (v) population growth rates and demographic
patterns; (vi) competition for retail and wholesale customers; (vii) pricing and
transportation of commodities; (viii) market demand, including structural market
changes;  (ix)  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of  inflation;  (x)
changes in project costs; (xi)  unanticipated  changes in operating expenses and
capital  expenditures;  (xii) capital market conditions;  (xiii) competition for
new  energy  development  opportunities;  and  (xiv)  legal  and  administrative
proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal)  and  settlements  that  influence the
business and profitability of the Company.

Any  forward-looking  statements  speaks  only  as of the  date  on  which  such
statement  is made,  and the  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any
forward-looking  statement to reflect events or circumstances  after the date on
which such  statement  is made or to reflect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated
events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of such  factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any
such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

         2. Seller has requested Purchaser and Agent to amend specified terms of
the Agreement to increase the maximum  Purchase Limit,  and Purchaser and Agent,
on the basis of their  independent  credit review and other such factors as they

         NOW, THEREFORE,  for good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and

shall have been satisfied.

         SECTION 3.        Effect  of  Amendment;   Ratification.   Except  as
specifically  amended  hereby,  the Agreement shall remain in full force and
