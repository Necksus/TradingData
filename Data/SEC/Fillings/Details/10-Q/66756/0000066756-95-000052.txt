Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should 
be read in conjunction with the Company's 1994 Form 10-K. In the opinion of the 
Company, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the 
interim periods have been included. The results of operations for an interim 
period may not give a true indication of results for the year. The income 
statement information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect the 
discontinuance of the paper and pulp business. Financial statement information 
may not be comparable between periods due to the purchase of ADESA on July 1, 
1995.

Note 3. Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. 
Under the terms of the contract which extends through 2007, the Company is 
purchasing 71 percent of the output from a generating plant which is capable of 
generating up to 470 MW. Reductions to about 49 percent of the output are 
provided for in the contract and, at the option of Square Butte, could begin 
after a five-year advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power and energy is a proportionate share of Square Butte's 
fixed obligations and variable operating costs, based on the percentage of the 
total output purchased by the Company. The annual fixed obligations of the 
Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1995 through 1999. The variable 
operating costs are not incurred unless production takes place. The Company is 
responsible for paying all costs and expenses of Square Butte if not paid by 
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company 
are absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered 
to the Company.

In March 1995 based on the results of a project which analyzed the economic 
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the 
board of directors of Lehigh directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of 
Lehigh's assets in a manner that would maximize utilization of tax benefits. 
With this new directive in place, Lehigh recognized $18.4 million of income in 
the first quarter of 1995 by reducing a portion of the valuation reserve that 
offsets the deferred tax assets. The Company's portion of that income is $14.7 
million, or 52 cents per share.

Note 5. Discontinued Operations

On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its interest in the paper and pulp 
business to CPI for $118 million in cash, plus CPI's assumption of certain debt 
and lease obligations. The Company is still committed to a maximum guaranty of 
$90 million to ensure a portion of LSPI's $33.4 million annual lease obligation 
for equipment under an operating lease extending to 2012. However, CPI has 
agreed to indemnify the Company for any payments the Company may make as a 
result of the Company's existing obligation relating to the LSPI operating 
lease.

The financial results of the paper and pulp business including the loss on 
disposition have been accounted for as discontinued operations.

Note 6.   Acquisition of ADESA

On July 1, 1995, Minnesota Power became an 80 percent owner of ADESA for $167 
million in cash. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a purchase. The 
transaction resulted in additional goodwill of approximately $115 million, 
which will be amortized over a 40 year period. The Company has included ADESA 
in its consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.

Put and call agreements with ADESA's four top managers provide ADESA management 
the right to sell to Minnesota Power, and Minnesota Power the right to 
purchase, ADESA management's 20 percent retained ownership interest in ADESA, 
in increments during the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, at a price based on ADESA's 
financial performance.

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents the consolidated results of 
operations of the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 1995 and 
1994, as if the acquisition of ADESA had occurred on January 1 of the 
respective periods. The information is not necessarily indicative of the 
financial position or operating results that would have occurred had the 
acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the respective periods, nor is 
it necessarily indicative of future operating results. It has been prepared 
from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated 
financial statements and related notes thereto of Minnesota Power and ADESA. To 
prepare the pro forma data, certain adjustments have been made which include: 
(i) the reduction of investment income resulting from utilization of the 
Company's cash and investments to finance the acquisition; (ii) the 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets; (iii) the change in 
depreciation expense resulting from purchase accounting; and (iv) the tax 
effects of the adjustments.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
          Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota Power has operations in four business areas: (1) electric utility 
operations, which include electric, gas and coal mining operations; (2) water 
utility operations, which include water and wastewater; (3) an auto 
redistribution business acquired on July 1, 1995; and (4) investments and 
corporate services, which include a financial guaranty reinsurance company, a 
real estate company and investments in securities.

Earnings per share of common stock for the quarter ended September 30, 1995, 
were 52 cents compared to 51 cents for the same period in 1994. Higher earnings 
in 1995 are primarily attributed to increased sales from the electric utility. 
Earnings from the securities portfolio and reinsurance business, combined with 
the addition of the auto redistribution business, also made positive 
contributions to 1995 earnings. Earnings in 1994 included the operations of the 
paper and pulp business which was sold on June 30, 1995.

Earnings per share of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 
1995, were $1.79 compared to $1.25 for the same period in 1994. The most 
significant factor contributing to the higher earnings in 1995 was the 
recognition of tax benefits associated with real estate which contributed 52 
cents to earnings per share. Earnings in 1995 also reflect the improved 
performance of the Company's securities portfolio, the addition of the auto 
redistribution business as of July 1, 1995, increased electric sales to 
industrial customers and other power suppliers, and higher paper and pulp 
prices before the paper and pulp business was sold. These earnings were offset 
in part by lower water consumption levels in Florida and an 18 cent per share 
provision associated with exiting the truck-mounted lifting equipment business. 
Earnings in 1994 include 13 cents per share from the recognition of escrow 
funds associated with real estate and a 21 cent per share write-off of an 
investment.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Quarter Ended September 30, 1995 and 1994.

Electric utility operations. Operating revenue and income from electric utility 
operations were higher in 1995 compared to 1994 primarily because of a 25 
percent increase in kilowatt-hour sales. Although sales to all retail customers 
were higher, sales for resale were up 62 percent due to warm summer weather and 
increased demand from other power suppliers. Fuel and purchased power expenses 
were higher in 1995 due to increased demand for electricity. Operations 
expenses included higher scheduled maintenance costs and customer service 
expenses tempered by lower payroll costs associated with an early retirement 
offering to certain electric utility employees. Coal operations contributed net 
income of $951,000 in 1995 and $854,000 in 1994 to electric utility operations.

Revenue from electric sales to taconite customers accounted for 34 percent of 
operating revenue and income from electric utility operations in 1995 compared 
to 35 percent in 1994. Revenue from electric sales to paper and other wood 
products companies accounted for 12 percent of operating revenue and income 
from electric utility operations in 1995 compared to 14 percent in 1994. 

Water utility operations. Operating revenue and income from water utility 
operations were up slightly in 1995 due to increased water sales in the 
Carolinas and Wisconsin. Sales in Florida were down in 1995 due in part to the 
December 1994 sale of SSU's Venice Gardens assets, abnormally high rainfall 
which reduced irrigation demand, and customer water conservation efforts. It is 
expected that the loss of customers as a result of the Venice Gardens sale will 
be offset when the purchase of Orange Osceola Utilities, Inc. is completed. The 
purchase, which was approved by the FPSC on October 10, 1995, is expected to 
close in late 1995.

In June 1995 SSU filed a request with the FPSC for an $18.6 million annual 
increase in water and wastewater treatment rates. SSU requested interim rates 
of $12.4 million (annualized) to be effective in October 1995. On October 6, 
1995, the FPSC denied SSU's request for interim rates. Reasons for denial 
included the fact the FPSC was unable to determine interim rates based on 
stand-alone rates since SSU filed its request based on uniform rates, as well 
as concerns over projected financial information on which the request was 
based. However, the FPSC recognized the unfairness of denying interim rates 
based upon this reason when, at the time SSU filed its rate case, SSU was 
unaware of the need for inclusion in its filing of a stand-alone rate 
structure. On October 23, 1995, SSU filed an appeal with the Florida First 
District Court of Appeals of the FPSC's October 6, 1995, denial of SSU's 
request for interim rates based on uniform rates. SSU's appeal requests 
expedited consideration by the court. SSU also intends to refile in early 
November 1995 information which would permit an $8 million to $12 million 
(annualized) interim rate increase. The interim rates, if approved by the FPSC, 
would become effective within sixty days of the filing, subject to refund with 
interest.

Auto redistribution operations. The Company purchased an 80 percent interest in 
ADESA on July 1, 1995. Results from ADESA's auto redistribution operations are 
included for the first time in the Company's consolidated financial statements 
for the period ended September 30, 1995. Approximately 119,000 cars, in total, 
were sold at ADESA's 17 auction sites in the United States and Canada, which 
represents a 14 percent increase from the approximately 104,000 cars sold in 
the third quarter of 1994.

Investments and corporate services. In 1995 improved market conditions enhanced 
the securities portfolio and reinsurance business results. Securities 
investments totaling $60 million

                                   - 11 -
<PAGE>
were sold to partially fund the July 1, 1995, purchase of ADESA. The lower 
income from real estate is due primarily to the timing of commercial real 
estate sales in Florida.

Discontinued operations. Operating results of the paper and pulp business as 
well as the disposition of that business have been included in discontinued 
operations.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 1995 and 1994.

Electric utility operations. Operating revenue and income from electric utility 
operations were higher in 1995 compared to 1994 due to an 11 percent increase 
in kilowatt-hour sales and to new rates in effect since June 1, 1995. Coal 
operations contributed $2.3 million and $2.2 million of net income in 1995 and 
1994, respectively, to electric utility operations.

Revenue from electric sales to taconite customers accounted for 36 percent of 
operating revenue and income from electric utility operations in 1995 compared 
to 33 percent in 1994. During 1995 taconite customers purchased 22 percent more 
electricity from Minnesota Power than in 1994. Revenue from electric sales to 
paper and other wood products companies accounted for 13 percent of operating 
revenue and income from electric utility operations in 1995 compared to 14 
percent in 1994. 

Water utility operations. Operating revenue and income from water utility 
operations were down in 1995 due in part to the December 1994 sale of SSU's 
Venice Gardens assets, abnormally high rainfall which reduced irrigation demand 
and customer water conservation efforts. It is expected that the loss of 
customers as a result of the Venice Gardens sale will be offset when the 
purchase of Orange Osceola Utilities, Inc. is completed. The purchase, which 
was approved by the FPSC on October 10, 1995, is expected to close in late 
1995.

Auto redistribution operations. Financial results from the auto redistribution 
operations reflect the three months of operations since the Company acquired 
ADESA on July 1, 1995.

Investments and corporate services. Earnings from investments and corporate 
services were higher in 1995 primarily due to the recognition of $18.4 million 
of tax benefits by Lehigh, the Company's real estate business. In March 1995 
based on the results of a project which analyzed the economic feasibility of 
realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board of directors 
of Lehigh directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's assets in a 
manner that would maximize utilization of tax benefits. The Company's portion 
of the tax benefits reflected in income is $14.7 million. Earnings in 1994 
include 13 cents per share from the recognition of escrow funds associated with 
Lehigh.

The performance of the Company's securities portfolio improved significantly 
over 1994 due to improved market conditions. Securities investments totaling 
$60 million were sold to partially fund the July 1, 1995, purchase of ADESA. In 
the first quarter of 1994 the Company wrote off a $10.1 million securities 
investment. In March 1995, the Company recorded a $5 million after-tax 
provision in anticipation of exiting Reach All. The provision lowered 1995 
earnings per share by 18 cents. It is expected that the liquidation of Reach 
All will be completed in late 1995.

Discontinued operations. Operating results of the paper and pulp business as 
well as the disposition of that business have been included in discontinued 
operations. Significantly higher paper and pulp prices increased earnings in 
1995.

Liquidity and Financial Condition

Reference is made to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine 
months ended September 30, 1995 and 1994, for purposes of the following 
discussion.

Cash flow activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number 
of factors representative of normal operations and three months of auto 
distribution operations since the July 1, 1995, acquisition of ADESA.

Cash from investing activities included proceeds from the sale of the paper and 
pulp business and proceeds from the sale of a portion of the securities 
portfolio that were used to fund the purchase of ADESA on July 1, 1995.

Working capital, if and when needed, generally is provided by the sale of 
commercial paper. In addition, securities investments can be liquidated to 
provide funds for reinvestment in existing businesses or acquisition of new 
businesses, and approximately 900,000 original issue shares of common stock are 
available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial amount of ADESA's working capital is generated internally because 
payments made by vehicle purchasers are generally available to satisfy ADESA's 
payment obligations to vehicle sellers. ADESA pays the seller and deposits the 
purchaser's check only at the time title is delivered. A consequence of this 
sequence of events is that the ADESA check issued to the seller sometimes 
clears before the bank into which ADESA deposits the purchaser's check makes 
available the funds represented by that check. ADESA has an $18 million line of 
credit to meet the short-term working capital requirements incident to this 
timing difference. ADESA also utilizes the line of credit in connection with 
factory sales. In factory sales, ADESA auctions vehicles provided by automobile 
manufacturers. ADESA generally is required to pay the manufacturers for the 
auctioned vehicles with electronic fund transfers before the checks received by 
ADESA from the purchasers clear.

ADESA, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Automotive Finance Corporation 
(AFC), also offers short-term on-site financing for dealers to purchase 
automobiles at auctions in exchange for a security interest in those 
automobiles. The financing is provided through the earlier of the date the 
dealer sells the automobile or a general borrowing term of 30-60 days. As a 
result, AFC has a $40 million revolving line of credit to meet its operational 
requirements.

Capital requirements. Consolidated capital expenditures for the nine months 
ended September 30, 1995, totaled $73 million. These expenditures include $32 
million for electric utility operations, of which $6.3 million was for coal 
operations, $22 million for water utility operations, $18 million for auto 
auction site relocation and development, and $700,000 for the discontinued 
operations. Internally generated funds were the primary source for funding 
these expenditures.

FERC operating licenses for two of the Company's hydroelectric facilities are 
currently undergoing relicensing at the FERC. A final application to relicense 
the Pillager Project was filed with the FERC on May 12, 1995, and was 
officially accepted by the FERC on October 2, 1995. The FERC will next perform 
an environmental analysis of the Pillager Project, which will define the scope 
of further review and relicensing activity. On July 13, 1995, the FERC issued a 
thirty (30) year license to the Company for the St. Louis River Project, which 
license, if implemented, would reduce the economic benefits of the Project to 
the Company. The Company and other interested parties filed motions for 
rehearing on certain aspects of the licensing order. On October 5, 1995, the 
Company filed a motion for clarification of the status of the license and, in 
the alternative, for stay of the license conditions until a final, 
nonappealable order is issued by the FERC.

On August 24, 1995, the Firm Large Power Customers filed with the Minnesota 
Court of Appeals an appeal of the MPUC's May 1995 decision. On September 8, 
1995, the Company requested that the MPUC order a partial stay of refunding 
until the legal proceedings are concluded. On October 26, 1995, the MPUC denied 
the Company's request. The Company expects to refund approximately $5 million, 
including interest, in December 1995 to customers based on interim rate revenue 
collected during the period March 1, 1994 through May 31, 1995.

Of the 215 electric utility employees eligible for the early retirement plan, 
178 employees accepted the early retirement offer representing a 12 percent 
reduction of the electric business workforce. The plan which has a cost of 
approximately $15 million will be amortized over 3 years.

On August 30, 1995, Minnesota Power submitted a request to the Minnesota 
Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) to delete permit language requiring additional 
work that was scheduled to begin during the second quarter of 1995. A response 
to this request is expected from the MPCA in November 1995.

On October 10, 1995, the FPSC approved the purchase by SSU of Orange Osceola 
Utilities, Inc. The purchase is expected to close in late 1995.

Ref. 8-K dated October 6, 1995, Page 1. - First and Second Paragraph

On October 19, 1995, the FPSC ordered SSU to refund, within 90 days of the date 
of the order, approximately $10 million to customers who paid more since 
October 1993 under uniform rates than they would have paid under stand-alone 
rates. This action by the FPSC is in response to a decision by the Florida 
First District Court of Appeals issued on April 6, 1995, that the FPSC lacked 
statutory authority to approve the implementation of uniform rates in its 1993 
Order absent a finding that the localities subject to the uniform rates were 
served by a functionally related system. The FPSC order does not permit SSU to 
collect $10 million from customers who paid less under uniform rates. SSU 
believes that it is improper for the FPSC to order a refund to one group of 
customers without permitting SSU to recover the refund from the remaining 
customers because the First District Court of Appeals only addressed the issue 
of alleged over-payment by some service areas under the uniform rate design and 
not SSU's total revenue requirement. SSU intends to request FPSC 
reconsideration of the order, and if unsuccessful, believes it probable SSU 
will prevail on appeal.

On October 23, 1995, SSU filed an appeal with the Florida First District Court 
of Appeals of the FPSC's October 6, 1995, denial of SSU's request for interim 
rates based on uniform rates. SSU's appeal requests expedited consideration by 
the court. SSU also intends to refile in early November 1995 information which 
would permit an $8 million to $12 million interim rate increase on an annual 
basis based on stand-alone rates. If approved by the FPSC, the interim rates 
would become effective within sixty days of the filing, subject to refund with 
interest.

On July 31, 1995, the Circuit Court of South Carolina issued an order affirming 
the South Carolina Public Service Commission's (SCPSC) July 1994 order which 
denied Heater of Seabrook's request for an annual rate increase. An appeal to 
the South Carolina Supreme Court is expected to be filed in November 1995.

On July 31, 1995, the Circuit Court of South Carolina issued an order vacating 
the SCPSC's December 1994 order which denied Upstate Heater Utilities' 
(Upstate) request for an annual rate increase. The case was remanded to the 
SCPSC for the establishment of rates which are fair and reasonable.
On September 6, 1995, the SCPSC issued a second final order granting an annual 
increase of $8,000. Upstate filed a motion for reconsideration on October 2, 
1995.

On August 1, 1995, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) issued an 
order granting Heater Utilities interim rates of $262,000 annually. A final 
order is anticipated in November 1995.

On August 29, 1995, Heater Utilities filed with the NCUC for approval of a 
surcharge that would allow Heater Utilities to recover $297,000 in additional 
testing costs required by the EPA in

Corporation an $85,000 annual increase.

SSU has determined that the toxicity test failures at the Woodmere facilities 
in Duval County, Florida are presumably due to inappropriate salt water test 
species. A request was filed with the EPA in February 1995 to change testing 
requirements to fresh water species for consistency with the Florida Department 
of Environmental Protection (FDEP) wastewater permit for the Woodmere 
facilities, since the body of water affected is a fresh water body. A permit 
renewal application will be filed with the FDEP in November 1995 since the 
permitting authority was delegated by the EPA to the FDEP in May 1995. It is 
expected that the FDEP will allow fresh water test species and that the EPA 
Administrative Order will no longer be applicable.

Two consent orders have resulted in total penalties of $4,000 to date in 1995. 
One additional consent order with a proposed penalty of approximately $9,500 is
