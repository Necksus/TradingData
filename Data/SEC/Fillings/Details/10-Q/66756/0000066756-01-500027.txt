                           SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER
              THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  we are  hereby  filing  cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause our actual  results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this  quarterly  report on Form 10-Q, in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"  "predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue" or
similar  expressions)  are  not  statements  of  historical  facts  and  may  be
forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond our  control and may cause  actual  results to differ
materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

  -      prevailing  governmental  policies and  regulatory  actions,  including
         those of the United States Congress, state legislatures,  the FERC, the
         MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the PSCW and various county regulators, about
         allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and
         disposal of assets and facilities,  operation and construction of plant
         facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital  investments,  and
         present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including but
         not limited to transmission costs);

  -      economic  and  geographic  factors,  including  political  and economic
         risks;

  -      changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
         policies;

  -      weather conditions;

  -      population growth rates and demographic patterns;

  -      competition for retail and wholesale customers;

  -      pricing and transportation of commodities;

  -      market demand, including structural market changes;

  -      changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

  -      changes in project costs;

  -      unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

  -      capital market conditions;

  -      competition for new energy development opportunities; and

  -      legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or criminal) and
         settlements that influence the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking  statement
to reflect  events or  circumstances  after the date on which that  statement is
made or to reflect the occurrence of  unanticipated  events.  New factors emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for  management to predict all of those
factors, nor can it assess the impact of each of those factors on the businesses
of ALLETE or the extent to which any factor,  or  combination  of  factors,  may
cause  actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  contained  in  any
forward-looking statement.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Florida First  District Court
of Appeals (Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform
rates for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With  "uniform  rates" all
customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and  wastewater
services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
ordered  Florida Water to issue  refunds to those  customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge to  customers  who paid
less under uniform rates. Florida Water appealed, and the Court of Appeals ruled
in June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without balancing surcharges.
In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC issued an order in January
1998 that did not require  refunds.  In February 1998 this order was appealed by
customers  who paid more under  uniform  rates.  That  appeal is still  pending.
Florida Water's potential refund liability is about $15 million,  which includes
interest.  We believe  that if refunds are ordered an equal  surcharge  to other
customers would be required consistent with the 1997 Court of Appeals ruling. We
are unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

In the same January 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund,  with
interest,  $2.5 million, the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service
area from January 1996 through June 1997 under uniform rates which  exceeded the
amount  these  customers  would  have paid  under a  modified  stand-alone  rate
structure.  No balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund
because  Spring  Hill  customers  continued  to pay  uniform  rates  after other
customers began paying modified  stand-alone  rates effective January 1996 under
the FPSC's  interim rate order in Florida  Water's 1995 rate case.  The FPSC did
not include Spring Hill in this interim rate order because  Hernando  County had
assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring  Hill's  rates.  In June 1997  Florida  Water
reached an agreement with Hernando County to revert prospectively to stand-alone
rates for Spring Hill customers.

Florida  Water  appealed the $2.5  million  refund  order.  While the appeal was
pending, Florida Water and Hernando County reached a settlement of all remaining
issues in this matter that  provides  Spring Hill  customers  with a prospective
rate reduction  effective April 2001 reducing annual revenue by $0.6 million for
three years with no refunds.  Florida  Water  agreed not to file a rate case for
three years. The settlement was approved in December 2000 by Hernando County and
the FPSC in February 2001. The appeal has been dismissed.



NOTE 3.    ACQUISITIONS

ADESA AUCTION FACILITIES. On January 18, 2001 we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of ComSearch in exchange for ALLETE common stock and paid cash to purchase
all of the assets of Auto Placement  Center,  Inc. (APC) in transactions with an
aggregate  value of $62.4  million.  APC was  accounted  for using the  purchase
method.  APC financial results have been included in our consolidated  financial
statements since the date of purchase.  ComSearch was accounted for as a pooling
of  interest  with  financial  results  included in our  consolidated  financial
statements  since  January 1, 2001.  Pro forma  financial  results have not been
presented due to immateriality.

DICKS CREEK. ALLETE Water Services purchased, subject to certain conditions, the
assets of Dicks Creek, a wastewater  utility located near Atlanta,  Georgia,  in
December  2000 for $6.6 million  plus a  commitment  to pay the seller a fee for
residential  connections.  The  commitment  requires the payment of a minimum of
$400,000 annually beginning December 31, 2001 for four years or until cumulative
payments reach $2 million,  whichever  occurs first.  The transaction  closed on
February 1, 2001 and was  accounted  for using the  purchase  method.  Financial
results  have been  included  in our  consolidated  financial  statements  since
February  2001.  Pro forma  financial  results  have not been  presented  due to
immateriality.

NOTE 6.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the  quarter  ended  March 31,  2001  total  comprehensive  income was $26.4
million   ($49.0   million  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2000).   Total
comprehensive  income  includes  net  income,  unrealized  gains  and  losses on
securities  classified  as  available-for-sale,  changes in the fair value of an
interest rate swap and foreign currency translation adjustments.



NOTE 7.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

As of January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
(SFAS) 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS
133  establishes   accounting  and  reporting  standards  requiring  that  every
derivative  instrument  be recorded  on the balance  sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at fair value.  Changes in fair value are to be recognized in
current  earnings or other  comprehensive  income,  depending on the purpose for
which  the  derivative  is  held.  Our  use  of  derivative  instruments  is not
significant. Upon adoption of SFAS 133, we held two interest rate swaps, both of
which qualify for hedge accounting.  Based on our current hedging practices, the
adoption of SFAS 133 will have minimal earnings impact.

NOTE 8.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase  agreement with Square Butte that extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in our electric service  territory and enables Minnesota Power to meet
power pool  reserve  requirements.  Square  Butte,  a North  Dakota  cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center,
North Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit owned by Minnkota Power
Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative corporation whose Class
A members are also members of Square Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of
the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's  output
under the  Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance
notice  requirement,  Minnkota  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  Minnesota Power
is  obligated  to pay its pro  rata  share  of  Square  Butte's  costs  based on
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to  Unit  output.   Minnesota  Power's  payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service. At March 31, 2001 Square Butte had total debt
outstanding  of $314.9  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of the years 2001 through 2003
and $23  million in both 2004 and 2005.  Variable  operating  costs  include the
price of coal purchased from BNI Coal,  Ltd., our subsidiary,  under a long-term
contract.  Minnesota  Power's payments to Square Butte are approved as purchased
power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

NET INCOME

The  following  net  income  discussion  summarizes  significant  events for the
quarter ended March 31, 2001.

ENERGY  SERVICES' net income in 2001  reflected  increased  margins on wholesale
marketing   activities  and  increased   sales  to  residential  and  commercial
customers.   These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  decreased  sales  to
industrial customers.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  reported  higher  net  income  in 2001 due to  significant
acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001 and  increased  financing  activity at
AFC's  loan  production  offices.  EBITDAL  for  ADESA's 28  same-store  auction
facilities was flat for the first quarter of 2001 reflecting increased costs and
no increase in volumes because of inclement  weather in 2001.  Vehicles expected
at auction in the first

<PAGE>

quarter of 2001 that did not occur are expected to come to auction in the second
and third quarters of 2001.

WATER SERVICES' net income was higher in 2001  reflecting  customer  growth,  an
October 2000 rate increase implemented by Heater,  productivity enhancements and
the  release  of  escrow  proceeds  received  from the sale of  assets to Orange
County, Florida in 1997.

INVESTMENTS  reported  lower net income in 2001  primarily  due to the timing of
sales by our real estate operations.  In 2000 significant real estate sales were
recorded  during  the first  quarter.  There were no  comparable  sales in 2001.
However,  in April 2001 our real estate  operations  announced  that its largest
sale ever is expected to close in June 2001.  Net income  from  Investments  was
also lower in 2001 due to lower income from our emerging technology  investments
and our securities  portfolio.  The after-tax return on our securities portfolio
was 10.32  percent  in 2001  (3.96  percent  in 2000),  however,  we had a lower
average  balance  in 2001.  During  2000 we reduced  the size of our  securities
portfolio  to  partially  fund  significant   acquisitions  made  by  Automotive
Services.


COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating revenue was up $17.8 million, or 13 percent in 2001.
Additional  demand revenue from large power customers who converted a portion of
their  interruptible  power to firm power and fuel clause  recoveries for higher
purchased  power  and gas  prices  more  than  offset a 7  percent  decrease  in
megawatthour  sales.  The decline in  megawatthour  sales was attributed to a 20
percent  decrease in sales to taconite  customers  due to  temporary  shutdowns.
Megawatthour  sales to residential and commercial  customers were up due to more
normal  winter  weather in 2001.  In addition,  the average price we charged for
wholesale  electricity was up 58 percent  reflecting  overall  wholesale  market
conditions and adding $6.1 million to operating revenue.

Revenue from  electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 9 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2001 (13 percent in 2000).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in both 2001 and 2000. Sales to other power suppliers accounted for 6 percent of
consolidated operating revenue in both 2001 and 2000.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES'  operating revenue was up $91.6 million, or 77 percent, in
2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001. At
ADESA auction  facilities  500,000 vehicles were sold in 2001 (295,000 in 2000),
an increase of 69 percent.  Financial  results for 2001 included three months of
operations  from 28 auction  facilities  acquired  or opened in 2000 and results
from  acquisitions  made in  January  2001.  Financial  results  for  2001  were
negatively  impacted by the timing of vehicles  coming to auction and  inclement
weather that resulted in both low attendance at and canceled auctions. Operating
revenue  from AFC was also higher in 2001  reflecting  a 13 percent  increase in
vehicles   financed   through  its  loan   production   offices.   AFC  financed
approximately  221,000  vehicles in 2001 (195,000 in 2000).  AFC has had 86 loan
production offices since April 2000.

WATER SERVICES' operating revenue was up $1.5 million, or 5 percent, in 2001 due
to customer  growth of 6 percent,  an October 2000 rate increase  implemented by
Heater and the release of escrow  proceeds  received  from the sale of assets to
Orange County, Florida in 1997.

INVESTMENTS'  operating revenue was down $20.5 million,  or 61 percent,  in 2001
primarily due to the timing of sales by our real estate operations.  In 2001 two
large real estate sales contributed $2.6 million to revenue, while in 2000 three
large real estate sales contributed  $18.8 million to revenue.  Revenue from our
emerging  technology  investments  was also $3.1 million lower in 2001.  Revenue
from our  securities  portfolio was down slightly in 2001 due to a lower average
balance.

<PAGE>


OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating  expenses were up $15.4 million,  or 12 percent,  in
2001 because of higher prices paid for purchased power and purchased gas.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES' operating expenses were up $82.0 million, or 83 percent, in
2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001. In
addition to the  increased  costs  associated  with having more vehicle  auction
facilities in operation, expenses in 2001 included integration costs, additional
amortization of goodwill and higher  interest  expense related to debt issued in
late  2000 to  finance  these  acquisitions.  Operating  expenses  in 2001  also
reflected  additional  expenses for utility and labor costs incurred as a result
of inclement weather  conditions  compared to 2000 when weather  conditions were
relatively mild.

WATER SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $0.4 million,  or 2 percent, in 2001
due to  customer  growth  and the  inclusion  of water  and  wastewater  systems
acquired in 2000.

INVESTMENTS'  operating expenses were down $10.7 million, or 71 percent, in 2001
as a result of lower sales by our real estate operations.


OUTLOOK

We experienced  solid performance from each of our four business segments during
the first quarter of 2001. Automotive Services acquisitions made during 2000 and
early  2001,  and  continued   growth  of  AFC,  our  vehicle  finance  company,
contributed  significantly to net income for the first quarter of 2001. With the
addition of "total loss"  vehicle  recovery  services at existing  ADESA vehicle
auction   facilities   and  economies  of  scale  as  a  result  of  integration
efficiencies at newly acquired vehicle auction facilities,  we expect to achieve
our 2001 goal of a 40 percent  earnings  growth  for  Automotive  Services.  The
increase  in cash flow  from  Automotive  Services  will be used to pay down the
acquisition debt.

We announced  the $29 million  sale of the Tarpon Point  property in Fort Myers,
Florida, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2001.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES. During the first quarter of 2001 cash flow from operations
reflected  strong  operating  results  and  continued  focus on working  capital
management.  Cash flow from  operations  was lower in 2001 due to $15 million of
cash related to AFC's  December  2000  floorplanning  program  expansion  with a
manufacturer (see Working Capital below) and the timing of Automotive  Services'
cash receipts and disbursements.  Cash flow from operations was also affected by
a number of factors representative of normal operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper.  Our  securities  investments  can be
liquidated  to  provide  funds  for  reinvestment  in  existing   businesses  or
acquisition of new businesses.  Approximately 6 million original issue shares of
our common stock are available for issuance  through INVEST  DIRECT,  our direct
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided.  However, ADESA has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC also has  arrangements  to use proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper
issued by ALLETE to meet its  operational  requirements.  AFC offers  short-term
on-site financing for dealers to purchase vehicles

13                     ALLETE First Quarter 2001 Form 10-Q

<PAGE>

at auctions in exchange for a security interest in those vehicles. The financing
is provided  through  the earlier of the date the dealer  sells the vehicle or a
general borrowing term of 30 to 45 days.

AFC sells certain  finance  receivables on a revolving  basis to a wholly owned,
unconsolidated,  qualified special purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn
sells,  on  a  revolving  basis,  an  undivided  interest  in  eligible  finance
receivables,  up to a maximum at any one time  outstanding  of $300 million,  to
third party  purchasers  under an agreement  that expires at the end of 2002. At
March 31, 2001 AFC had sold $401.2 million of finance receivables to the special
purpose subsidiary ($335.7 million at December 31, 2000). Third party purchasers
had purchased an undivided  interest in finance  receivables  of $274.0  million
from this subsidiary at March 31, 2001 ($239 million at December 31, 2000).  AFC
also  entered  into an  arrangement  in  December  2000 with a  manufacturer  to
floorplan  certain vehicles located at auctions awaiting resale by June 15, 2001
for a security interest in those vehicles.  AFC sells these finance receivables,
on a revolving basis, to another wholly owned, unconsolidated, qualified special
purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary  borrows money from a third party under an
agreement  that  expires  June 15,  2001.  At March 31,  2001 AFC had sold $38.8
million of these finance  receivables to the special purpose  subsidiary  ($53.5
million at December  31,  2000).  At March 31,  2001 the third party  lender had
advanced  $40 million  against  these  receivables  ($43 million at December 31,
2000).  At March 31, 2001 AFC also held $19.3  million in cash that will be used
to pay down a portion of the $40 million of third  party  lender debt during the
second quarter of 2001.  Unsold finance  receivables and unfinanced  receivables
held  by the  special  purpose  subsidiaries  are  recorded  by AFC as  residual
interest at fair value. Fair value is based upon estimates of future cash flows,
using assumptions that market  participants would use to value such instruments,
including   estimates  of  anticipated  credit  losses  over  the  life  of  the
receivables  sold without  application  of a discount rate due to the short-term
nature of the  receivables  sold. The fair value of AFC's residual  interest was
$122.7 million at March 31, 2001 ($106.2 million at December 31, 2000). Proceeds
from the sale of the receivables  were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
March 31, 2001  compared to December  31, 2000 were due to  increased  sales and
financing  activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down
during the winter months and in December  because of the holidays.  As a result,
both ADESA and AFC had higher receivables and higher payables at March 31, 2001.

ACQUISITIONS  AND  DIVESTITURES.   In  January  2001  we  acquired  all  of  the
outstanding stock of ComSearch in exchange for ALLETE common stock and paid cash
to purchase all of the assets of APC in transactions  with an aggregate value of
$62.4 million.  APC was funded with  internally  generated  funds and short-term
debt which was refinanced with long-term  debt. (See Long-Term Debt below.)  APC
is a  provider  of "total  loss"  vehicle  recovery  services  with ten  auction
facilities  in  the  United  States.  ComSearch  provides  Internet-based  parts
location  and  insurance  adjustment  audit  services  nationwide.  Both APC and
ComSearch are based in Rhode Island.

ALLETE Water Services purchased,  subject to certain  conditions,  the assets of
Dicks Creek, a wastewater  utility  located near Atlanta,  Georgia,  in December
2000 for $6.6  million  plus a  commitment  to pay the  seller a fee for  future
residential  connections.  The  commitment  requires  payment  of a  minimum  of
$400,000 annually beginning December 31, 2001 for four years or until cumulative
payments reach $2 million,  whichever  occurs first.  The transaction  closed in
February 2001 and was funded with internally generated funds.

In April 2001 we announced ALLETE  Properties has a firm contract to sell Tarpon
Point  Marina and the  surrounding  150 acres of  development  property  in Cape
Coral,  Florida to the Grosse Point Development Company for $29 million in cash.
To  effect  this  transaction,  ALLETE  Properties  will  sell the  stock of its
subsidiary that owns the real estate being  transferred.  Cape Coral is adjacent
to Fort Myers.  The closing is  scheduled  for June 2001 and is expected to be a
significant  contributor  to  earnings  in the  second  quarter  of  2001.  This
transaction  will be the largest  single real  estate  sale by a  subsidiary  of
ALLETE.

In May 2001  ADESA  purchased  the  assets  of the I-44 Auto  Auction  in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.  The I-44 Auto Auction  which is located on 75 acres was renamed ADESA
Tulsa and offers  six fully  automated  auction  lanes,  storage  for over 3,000
vehicles and a five-bay  reconditioning and detail facility. The transaction was
funded with internally generated funds.

<PAGE>


LONG-TERM  DEBT.  In February 2001 we issued $125 million of 7.80% Senior Notes,
due  February  15,  2008.  Proceeds  were  used to repay a portion  of  ALLETE's
short-term  bank  borrowings  incurred for the  acquisition  of vehicle  auction
facilities in 2000 and early 2001 and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2001 ALLETE,  ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III, jointly filed a
registration  statement  with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under the  Securities
Act of 1933. The registration  statement,  which has been declared  effective by
the SEC,  relates  to the  possible  issuance,  from  time to time  when  market
conditions  and the  needs of ALLETE  warrant,  of an  aggregate  amount of $500
million of securities  which may include  ALLETE common  stock,  first  mortgage
bonds,  and other debt  securities  and ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III
preferred  trust   securities.   ALLETE  also  previously   filed   registration
statements,  which have been  declared  effective  by the SEC,  relating  to the
possible  issuance,  from time to time when market  conditions  and the needs of
ALLETE  warrant,  of 1,814,000  shares of ALLETE common stock and $25 million of
first mortgage bonds and other debt securities.  Any offer and sale of the above
mentioned  securities  will be made only by means of a  prospectus  meeting  the
requirements  of the  Securities  Act of 1933  and  the  rules  and  regulations
thereunder.

In May 2001 we redeemed $1.3 million of 5.6%  Industrial  Development  Refunding
Revenue Bonds, Series 1994-A, City of Little Falls,  Minnesota.  This redemption
was funded with internally generated funds.

INVESTMENTS.  As companies included in our emerging  technology  investments are
sold, we may  recognize a gain or loss.  In the second half of 2000,  several of
the private  companies  included in our  emerging  technology  investments  went
public by completing initial public offerings. Typically, investors in a private
company are not  permitted to sell stock in the company for a period of 180 days
following the company's initial public offering.  Other restrictions on sale may
also  apply.  Since  going  public,  the  market  value of these  companies  has
experienced  significant  volatility.  Our investment in the companies that have
gone public has a cost basis of approximately $13 million.  The aggregate market
value of our investment in these companies at March 31, 2001 was $33 million.

Our  emerging  technology  investments  provide  us with  access  to  developing
technologies  before their  commercial  debut,  as well as  potential  financial
returns and diversification opportunities. We view these investments as a source
of capital for  redeployment in existing  businesses and a potential entree into
additional  business  opportunities.  Portions of any proceeds received on these
investments  may be reinvested  back into companies to encourage  development of
future technology.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital expenditures for the quarter ended
March 31, 2001 totaled $24.6 million ($30.1 million in 2000).  Expenditures  for
2001  included  $8.0 million for Energy  Services,  $9.7 million for  Automotive
Services and $6.9 million for Water Services. Internally generated funds and the
issuance  of  long-term  debt were the  primary  sources  of  funding  for these
expenditures.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our  securities  portfolio  has exposure to both price and  interest  rate risk.
Investments  held  principally  for  near-term  sale are  classified  as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies.  In strategies  designed to hedge
overall market risks, we also sell common stock short.  Investments  held for an
indefinite  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale  securities and
also recorded at fair value. Available-for-sale securities consist of our direct
investments in emerging  technology  companies and securities in a grantor trust
established to fund certain employee benefits.

In  December  1999 the FERC  issued  its  Order  No.  2000 in which it  strongly
encouraged all transmission owners in the United States to transfer  operational
control over their  transmission  systems to independent  regional  transmission
organizations  that would have certain  specified  characteristics  and  perform
certain  specified  functions  relating to the  transmission  of  electricity in
interstate commerce. On February 28, 2001 Minnesota Power and SWL&P submitted an
application for membership in the Midwest  Independent  System Operator  (MISO),
which is proposing to become one of the nation's largest electric power delivery
systems, and signed the MISO's Transmission Owner's Agreement.  Participation by
Minnesota  Power  and  SWL&P  is  contingent  on the  receipt  of all  necessary
regulatory approvals.

The MISO was founded in 1996 by certain  transmission  owners in the  Midwestern
United States and was specifically configured to comply with the FERC concept of
an independent regional transmission organization. Its primary objectives are to
provide open access to a large regional  transmission  system, thus facilitating
development of a robust  marketplace and enhancing the stability and reliability
of the region's power grid.  When it becomes  operational,  the non-profit  MISO
will operate as a single transmission system for the transmission  facilities of
several Midwestern transmission owners.

                                   ARTICLE III

      1.    The total authorized number of shares of capital stock of this

<PAGE>

            (b) The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to issue at any time
and from time to time  such  number of  shares,  not to exceed in the  aggregate
2,500,000  shares of one or more  series of the Serial  Preferred  Stock A, with
such dividend rate or rates, terms and conditions on which shares of such series
may be  redeemed  and the  redemption  price or prices,  preferential  amount or
amounts  payable  on shares of such  series  in the  event of the  voluntary  or
involuntary liquidation of the Corporation, terms and conditions on which shares

conversion,  and  sinking  fund or purchase  fund  provisions,  if any,  for the
redemption or purchase of shares and bearing such series  designations as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors  and stated and  expressed in the  resolution or
resolutions  establishing the respective series of such stock, the authority for
which is hereby expressly vested in the Board of Directors.

            (c) The Serial Preferred Stock and the Serial Preferred Stock A are
hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the "Serial Stocks".

      3.    The 5% Preferred Stock and the Serial Stocks, pari passu, shall be
entitled, but only when and as declared by the Board of Directors,  out of funds
legally  available  for the payment of  dividends,  in  preference to the Common
Stock,  to  dividends at the rate of five per centum (5%) per annum as to the 5%
Preferred  Stock  and,  as to the  Serial  Stocks at the rate as to each  series
thereof fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors  establishing  such series
of Serial Stocks, respectively, payable, as to the 5% Preferred Stock, quarterly
on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year,  or  otherwise  as the
Board of Directors may  determine,  and payable,  as to any series of the Serial
Stocks, on such dates as the Board of Directors may determine prior to the issue
of any  shares of such  series,  to  shareholders  of  record as of a date,  not
exceeding  thirty  (30) days and not less  than ten (10)  days,  preceding  such
dividend  payment dates, to be fixed by the Board of Directors;  such dividends,
as to the 5%  Preferred  Stock,  to be  cumulative  from July 1, 1945,  and such
dividends,  as to each series of the Serial  Stocks,  to be cumulative  from the
first day of the  current  dividend  period  within  which such shares of Serial
Stocks are issued. Neither the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock nor the holders
of the Serial Stocks shall be entitled to receive any  dividends  thereon out of
profits other than dividends referred to in this paragraph.

      4.    The 5% Preferred Stock and the Serial Stocks, pari passu, shall also
have a  preference  over the Common  Stock  upon any  voluntary  or  involuntary
liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up  of  the  Corporation,  or  upon  any
distribution of assets, other than profits, until there shall have been paid, by
dividends or distribution,  on the 5% Preferred Stock the full par value thereof
and five per centum (5%) per annum thereon from July 1, 1945, and on each series
of the  Serial  Preferred  Stock One  Hundred  Dollars  ($100) per share plus an
amount  equal to  dividends  upon the shares of such series at the rate or rates
fixed by the Board of  Directors  from the date or dates on which  dividends  on
such shares became cumulative and on each series of Serial Preferred Stock A, as
stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of
each such series  adopted by the Board of  Directors.  Neither the 5%  Preferred
Stock nor the Serial Preferred Stock shall receive any share in any voluntary or
involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of this Corporation,  or in
any  distribution of assets in excess of the amounts stated in this paragraph or
in the case of the Serial  Preferred Stock A, in excess of the amounts stated in
the  resolution  or  resolutions  providing  for the  issue of  shares of Serial
Preferred Stock A.

      5.    For the purpose of this (fifth) paragraph of this Article III of
these  Articles:  (i) the term "Common  Stock  Equity" shall mean the sum of the
stated capital of the outstanding Common Stock,  premium on Common Stock and the
earned surplus and the capital and paid-in surplus of this Corporation,  whether
or not available for the payment of dividends on the Common Stock; (ii) the term
"total  capitalization"  shall mean the sum of the stated capital  applicable to
the outstanding stock of all

                                       2

<PAGE>

classes of this  Corporation,  the earned  surplus  and the  capital and paid-in
surplus  of the  Corporation,  whether  or not  available  for  the  payment  of
dividends on the Common Stock of the  Corporation,  any premium on Capital Stock
of the  Corporation  and the principal  amount of all  outstanding  debts of the
Corporation maturing more than twelve months after the date of the determination
of the total  capitalization;  and (iii) the term  "dividends  on Common  Stock"
shall embrace  dividends and distributions on Common Stock (other than dividends
or  distributions  payable only in shares of Common Stock),  and the purchase or
other  acquisitions  for value of any Common Stock of this  Corporation or other
stock, if any, subordinate to its 5% Preferred Stock and Serial Stocks.  Subject
to the rights of the holders of the 5% Preferred  Stock,  and Serial  Stocks and
subordinate  thereto (and subject and  subordinate to the rights of any class of
stock hereafter authorized),  the Common Stock alone shall receive all dividends
and shares in liquidation,  dissolution,  winding up or distribution  other than
those  to be  paid on  shares  of 5%  Preferred  Stock  and  Serial  Stocks,  as
hereinbefore  provided.  So long as any shares of 5% Preferred  Stock, or Serial
Stocks are outstanding,  this Corporation shall not declare or pay any dividends
on the Common Stock, except as follows:

             (1) If and so long as the Common Stock Equity at the end of the
calendar  month  immediately  preceding  the date on which a dividend  on Common
Stock is declared is, or as a result of such dividend  would  become,  less than
20% of total capitalization, the Corporation shall not declare such dividends in
an amount  which,  together  with all other  dividends on Common Stock  declared
within the year ending with and including the date of such dividend declaration,
exceeds 50% of the net income of the Corporation  available for dividends on the
Common Stock for the twelve full calendar months immediately preceding the month
in which such dividends are declared; and

             (2) If and so long as the Common Stock Equity at the end of the
calendar  month  immediately  preceding  the date on which a dividend  on Common
Stock is declared is, or as a result of such dividend  would  become,  less than
25% but not less than 20% of total  capitalization,  the  Corporation  shall not
declare  dividends on the Common  Stock in an amount  which,  together  with all
other  dividends  on Common  Stock  declared  within  the year  ending  with and
including the date of such dividend  declaration,  exceeds 75% of the net income
of the  Corporation  available  for dividends on the Common Stock for the twelve
full calendar months immediately preceding the month in which such dividends are
declared; and

             (3) At any time when the Common Stock Equity is 25% or more of
total  capitalization the Corporation may not declare dividends on shares of the
Common  Stock  which would  reduce the Common  Stock  Equity  below 25% of total
capitalization,  except to the  extent  provided  in  subparagraphs  (1) and (2)
above.

      6.    This Corporation, by a majority vote of its Board of Directors, may
at any time  redeem  all of said 5%  Preferred  Stock  or may from  time to time
redeem any part  thereof,  by paying in cash a  redemption  price of $105.00 per
share,  if  redeemed  before  July 1, 1946;  $l04.50 per share if redeemed on or
after July 1, 1946 and before July 1, 1947;  $104.00 per share if redeemed on or
after July 1, 1947 and before July 1, 1948;  $103.50 per share if redeemed on or
after July 1, 1948 and before July 1, 1949;  $103.00 per share if redeemed on or
after July 1, 1949 and before July 1, 1950; and $102.50 per share if redeemed on
or after July 1, 1950, plus unpaid accumulated dividends, if any, to the date of
redemption.

      7.    This Corporation, by a majority vote of its Board of Directors, may
at any time redeem all of the Serial Preferred Stock or Serial Preferred Stock A
or may from time to time redeem any series or any part of any series thereof, by
paying in cash the  redemption  price or prices  fixed for the  series of Serial
Preferred  Stock or Serial  Preferred  Stock A to be redeemed by  resolution  or
resolutions  of the

                                       3

<PAGE>

Board of Directors  establishing such series, plus unpaid accumulated dividends,
if any, to the date of redemption.

      8.    Notice of the intention of this Corporation to redeem all or any
part of the 5% Preferred Stock or all or any part of the Serial  Preferred Stock
or all or any  part of the  Serial  Preferred  Stock A shall be  mailed  30 days
before the date of redemption to each holder of record of preferred  stock to be
redeemed, at his post office address as shown by this Corporation's records; but
no failure to mail such notice nor any defect therein nor in the mailing thereof
shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of
preferred stock so to be redeemed. At any time after such notice has been mailed
as aforesaid,  this  Corporation may deposit the aggregate  redemption price (or
the portion thereof not already paid in the redemption of such preferred  stock)
with any bank or trust company in the City of New York, New York, or in the City
of Duluth,  Minnesota,  named in such notice, payable to the order of the record
holders  of the  preferred  stock  so to be  redeemed,  on the  endorsement,  if
required, and surrender of their certificates,  and thereupon said holders shall
cease to be  shareholders  with respect to said  shares,  and from and after the
making of such deposit,  said holders shall have no interest in or claim against
this  corporation  with  respect to said shares,  but shall be entitled  only to
receive the said moneys from said bank or trust company,  with interest, if any,
allowed  by such  bank or trust  company  on such  moneys  deposited  as in this
paragraph  provided,  on  endorsement,  if  required,  and  surrender  of  their
certificates as aforesaid.  Any moneys so deposited,  plus interest thereon,  if
any,  and  remaining  unclaimed  at the end of six years from the date fixed for
redemption,  if  thereafter  requested by  resolution of the Board of Directors,
shall be repaid to the  Corporation  and in the event of such  repayment  to the
Corporation  such  holders of record of the shares so redeemed as shall not have
made claim against such moneys prior to such repayment to the Corporation, shall
be deemed to be unsecured  creditors of the  Corporation  for an amount  without
interest  equivalent to the amount  deposited,  plus interest  thereon,  if any,
allowed by such bank or trust  company,  as above stated for the  redemption  of
such  shares and so paid to the  Corporation.  If less than all of the shares of
the 5%  Preferred  Stock or less  than all of the  shares  of any  series of the
Serial  Preferred  Stock are to be redeemed,  the shares to be redeemed shall be
selected by lot, in such manner as the Board of  Directors  of this  Corporation
shall  determine,  by an  independent  bank or trust  company  selected for that
purpose by the Board of Directors of this  Corporation.  If less than all of the
shares of any series of the Serial  Preferred  Stock A are to be  redeemed,  the
shares to be  redeemed  shall be  selected  by lot,  pro rata,  or by such other
method,  and in such manner as the Board of Directors of this Corporation  shall
determine. Nothing herein contained shall limit any right of this Corporation to
purchase  or  otherwise  acquire  any  shares  of 5%  Preferred  Stock or Serial
Preferred Stock or Serial Preferred Stock A.

      9.    Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, every shareholder of
record or his legal  representative,  at the date fixed for the determination of
persons entitled to vote at the meeting of shareholders, or, if no date has been
fixed,  then at the date of the meeting shall be entitled at such meeting to one
vote for each share standing in his name on the books of the Corporation.  There
shall be no  cumulative  voting by any class,  series or shares of stock of this
Corporation.

      10.   If and when dividends payable on any of the preferred stocks shall
be in default in an amount  equal to four full  quarterly  payments  or more per
share,  and  thereafter  until all dividends on any of the  preferred  stocks in
default  shall  have  been  paid,  the  holders  of all of the then  outstanding
preferred  stocks,  voting as a class,  shall be entitled to elect the  smallest
number of  directors  necessary  to  constitute  a majority of the full Board of
Directors,  and the  holders of the Common  Stock,  voting as a class,  shall be
entitled to elect the remaining directors of the Corporation, anything herein or
in the  Bylaws  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding.  The  terms  of  office,  as
directors,  of all persons who may be directors of the  Corporation  at the time
shall terminate upon the election of a majority of the Board of Directors by the

                                       4

<PAGE>

holders of the preferred stocks,  except that if the holders of the Common Stock
shall not have elected the remaining  directors of the  Corporation,  then,  and
only in that event, the directors of the Corporation,  as constituted just prior
to the  election of a majority of the Board of  Directors  by the holders of the
preferred  stocks,  shall  elect the  remaining  directors  of the  Corporation.
Thereafter, while such default continues and the majority of directors are being
elected by the holders of the preferred stocks, the remaining directors, whether
elected by directors,  as aforesaid,  or whether  originally or later elected by
holders of the Common Stock, shall continue in office until their successors are
elected by holders of the Common Stock and qualify.

      For the purposes of this (tenth) paragraph of this Article III of these
Articles,  every shareholder of record, or his legal  representative,  of Serial
Preferred Stock A shall be entitled to one vote, for each share, standing in his
name on the books of the Corporation,  with a liquidation  preference of $100 as
established in a resolution or  resolutions of the Board of Directors  providing
for the issue of shares of each series and each share of Serial  Preferred Stock
A with a  liquidation  preference  of less  than  $100  shall  be  afforded  its
proportional, fractional vote.

      For purposes of this (tenth) paragraph, there shall be no cumulative
voting by any class, series or shares of stock of this Corporation.

      11.   If and when all dividends then in default on the preferred stocks
then  outstanding  shall be paid (and such dividends  shall be declared and paid
out of any funds legally available therefore as soon as reasonably practicable),
the holders of the preferred  stocks shall be divested of any special right with
respect to the election of directors  and the voting power of the holders of the
preferred  stocks and the holders of the Common Stock shall revert to the status
existing before the first dividend payment date on which dividends on any of the
preferred  stocks  were  not  paid in  full;  but  always  subject  to the  same
provisions  for vesting  such  special  rights in the  holders of the  preferred
stocks in case of further like default or defaults on  dividends  thereon.  Upon
the termination of any such special voting right upon payment of all accumulated
and  defaulted  dividends on the  preferred  stocks,  the terms of office of all
persons who may have been elected  directors of the  Corporation  by vote of the
holders of the preferred  stocks,  as a class,  pursuant to such special  voting
right shall forthwith terminate,  and the resulting vacancies shall be filled by
a vote of the majority of the remaining directors.

      12.   In case of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring among
the directors elected by the holders of the preferred stocks, voting as a class,
the  remaining  directors  elected by the holders of the  preferred  stocks,  by
affirmative vote of a majority thereof,  or the remaining director so elected if
there be but one,  may elect a successor  or  successors  to hold office for the
unexpired  terms of the  director or  directors  whose place or places  shall be
vacant.  Likewise in case of any  vacancy in the office of a director  occurring
among the  directors  not elected by the holders of the  preferred  stocks,  the
remaining  directors  not elected by the  holders of the  preferred  stocks,  by
affirmative vote of a majority thereof,  or the remaining director so elected if
there be but one,  may elect a successor  or  successors  to hold office for the
unexpired  term of the  director or  directors  whose  place or places  shall be
vacant.

      13.   Whenever the right shall have accrued to the holders of the
preferred  stocks to elect  directors,  voting as a class,  then upon request in
writing signed by any holder of preferred  stock entitled to vote,  delivered by
registered mail or in person to the president, a vice president or secretary, it
shall be the duty of such  officer  forthwith to cause notice to be given to the
shareholders  entitled  to vote  of a  meeting  to be held at such  time as such
officer may fix, not less than ten nor more than sixty days after the receipt of
such  request,  for  the  purpose  of  elected  directors.  At all  meetings  of
shareholders held for the purpose of electing  directors during such time as the
holders of the preferred stocks shall have the

                                       5

<PAGE>

special right, voting as a class, to elect directors,  the presence in person or
by proxy of the holders of a majority of the  outstanding  Common Stock shall be
required to constitute a quorum of such class for the election of directors, and
the  presence  in  person  or by  proxy  of the  holders  of a  majority  of the
outstanding  preferred  stocks  shall be required to  constitute a quorum of the
preferred  stocks for the election of  directors;  provided,  however,  that the
absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock or of preferred  stocks shall
not prevent the election at any such meeting or adjournment thereof of directors
by such other class or classes if the  necessary  quorum of the holders of stock
of such other class or classes is present in person or by proxy at such  meeting
or any adjournment  thereof;  and provided further that in the event a quorum of
the  holders of the Common  Stock is present  but a quorum of the holders of the
preferred stocks is not present,  then the election of the directors  elected by
the holders of the Common Stock shall not become  effective and the directors so
elected by the holders of the Common  Stock shall not assume  their  offices and
duties until the holders of the preferred stocks,  with a quorum present,  shall
have  elected  the  directors  they shall be  entitled  to elect;  and  provided
further,  however,  that in the absence of a quorum of the holders of either the
Common Stock or the preferred  stocks, a majority of the holders of the stock of
the class or classes  who are  present in person or by proxy shall have power to
adjourn  the  election of the  directors  to be elected by such class or classes
from time to time without  notice other than  announcement  at the meeting until
the  requisite  amount of holders  of such class or classes  shall be present in
person or by proxy, but such adjournment  shall not be made to a date beyond the
date for the mailing of notice of the next annual meeting of the  Corporation or
special meeting in lieu thereof.

      For the purpose of determining a quorum of the preferred stocks, as

this  Corporation  shall be vested in a Board of Directors,  the number of which

to a resolution adopted by affirmative vote of the majority of the Disinterested

Directors on the second Tuesday of May in each year after the year 1923,  unless
such day is a legal  holiday,  in which case such  meeting  shall be held on the
next day thereafter which is not a legal holiday or a Sunday.

         The Board of Directors, as soon as may be after the election of
directors in each year, shall elect one of their number President of this
Corporation and shall also elect one or more Vice Presidents, a

                                       9

Secretary  and a  Treasurer  and shall  from  time to time  appoint  such  other
officers as they may deem proper. The same person may hold more than one office,
except those of President and Vice President.

         The Board of Directors may, by unanimous affirmative action of the
entire  Board,  designate two or more of their number to constitute an Executive
Committee which, to the extent determined by unanimous affirmative action of the
entire  Board,  shall  have  and  exercise  the  authority  of the  Board in the
management  of the  business  of the  Corporation,  except the power to fill the
vacancies  in the  Board  and the  power to  change  the  membership  of or fill
vacancies in said Committee.  Any such Executive Committee shall act only in the
interval between meetings of the Board, and shall be subject at all times to the
control and direction of the Board.  By unanimous vote, the Board shall have the
power  at any  time to  change  the  membership  of such  Committee  and to fill
vacancies in it. The Executive  Committee may make such rules for the conduct of
its business and may appoint such chairman and  committees  and assistants as it
may deem necessary. A majority of the members of said committee shall constitute
a quorum.

        The stockholders may alter or amend the Bylaws of this Corporation by a
majority vote of all the outstanding stock of this Corporation  entitled to vote
given at any meeting  duly held as  provided in the Bylaws,  the notice of which
includes notice of the proposed alteration or amendment.  The Board of Directors
may also alter or amend the Bylaws at any time by affirmative vote of a majority
of the  Board of  Directors  given at a duly  convened  meeting  of the Board of
Directors,  the notice of which  includes  notice of the proposed  alteration or
amendment,  subject to the power of the  stockholders  to change or repeal  such
Bylaws;  provided that the Board of Directors  shall not make or alter any Bylaw
fixing their  number,  qualifications,  classifications,  or term of office,  or
changing  the  number  of  shares   required  to   constitute  a  quorum  for  a
stockholders' meeting.

                 fees)  paid  by  such  Interested  Shareholder  or  any  of its
                 Affiliates  in acquiring  any of its holdings of Common  Stock,
                 and

                 (ii)   is not less than the earnings per share of Common Stock

                 preceding  the record  date for  solicitation  of votes on such
                 Business  Combination  multiplied  by the  then  price/earnings
                 multiple (if any) of such Interested Shareholder as customarily
                 computed and reported in the financial community (provided that
                 this   subparagraph  (ii)  shall  not  be  applicable  if  such
                 Interested  Shareholder does not then have  outstanding  common
                 stock which is publicly traded in the United States).

                 (ii)   the market price of the 5% Preferred Stock, the Serial
                 Stocks or any other then  outstanding  preferred  stock of this
                 Corporation,  immediately  prior  to the  announcement  of such
                 Business Combination,

                 is at least as great as the ratio of:

                        (x) the highest per share price (including brokerage
                        commissions,  transfer  taxes  and  soliciting  dealers'
                        fees) which such  Interested  Shareholder  or any of its

                        Stock,  the Serial Stocks or any other then  outstanding

                        Combination, to

                        Serial  Stocks or any other then  outstanding  preferred
                        stock  of this  Corporation,  immediately  prior  to the
                        initial  acquisition by such  Interested  Shareholder or
                        any of its Affiliates of any of, the 5% Preferred Stock,
                        the  Serial   Stocks  or  any  other  then   outstanding
                        preferred stock of this Corporation.

             (e) The aggregate amount of the cash and the fair market value of
other  consideration  to be  received  per  share by  holders  of each of the 5%
Preferred Stock, the Serial Stocks or any other then outstanding preferred stock
of this  Corporation  in such Business  Combination is not less than the highest
per share price (including brokerage commissions,  transfer taxes and soliciting
dealers' fees) paid by such  Interested  Shareholder or any of its Affiliates in

any other then outstanding preferred stock of this Corporation.

             (f) If and to the extent applicable, the aggregate amount of cash

preferred  stock would be  entitled  to receive in the event of a  voluntary  or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this Corporation occurring
on the date of the Business Combination.

             (g) The consideration to be received by holders of any particular
class of outstanding Voting Shares in such Business  Combination shall be in the
same  form  and of the same  kind as the  consideration  paid by the  Interested
Shareholder in acquiring the shares of such class of Voting Shares already owned
by it. If the  Interested  Shareholder  has paid for any class of Voting  Shares
with varying forms of  consideration,  the form of  consideration to be received
for such class of Voting Shares shall be either cash or the form used to acquire
the largest number of shares of such class of Voting Shares previously  acquired
by it.

             (h) After the date on which the Interested Shareholder became an
Interested  Shareholder (the "Determination Date") and prior to the consummation
of such Business Combination:

                 (i)    the Interested Shareholder shall have taken steps to
                 ensure that this  Corporation's  Board of Directors included at
                 all times representation by Disinterested  Director(s) at least
                 proportionate  to the ratio that the Voting  Shares  which from
                 time  to time  are  owned  by  persons  who are not  Interested
                 Shareholders  ("Public  Holders")  bear  to all  Voting  Shares
                 outstanding  at such  respective  times  (with a  Disinterested
                 Director to occupy any resulting fractional board position);

                 (ii)   except as approved by a majority of the Disinterested
                  Directors, there shall have been no failure to declare and pay
                 at the regular  date  therefore  any full  quarterly  dividends
                 (whether or not  cumulative)  on the  outstanding  5% Preferred
                 Stock,  the Serial  Stocks and any other  preferred  stock then
                 outstanding;

                 (iii)  there shall have been (A) no reduction in the annual
                 rate of dividends paid on the Common Stock (except as necessary
                 to reflect  any  subdivision  of the Common  Stock),  except as
                 approved by a majority of the Disinterested  Directors, and (B)
                 an increase in such annual rate of  dividends  as  necessary to
                 reflect  any  reclassification  (including  any  reverse  stock
                 split),   recapitalization,   reorganization   or  any  similar
                 transaction  which has

                                       14

<PAGE>

                 the effect of reducing the number of outstanding  shares of the
                 Common  Stock,  unless the failure so to  increase  such annual
                 rate is approved by a majority of the Disinterested  Directors;
                 and

                 (iv)   such Interested Shareholder shall not have become the
                 Beneficial Owner of any additional Voting Shares, directly from
                 this   Corporation   or  otherwise,   except  as  part  of  the
                 transaction  which  results  in  such  Interested   Shareholder
                 becoming an Interested Shareholder.

             (i) After the Determination Date, the Interested Shareholder shall
not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as
a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial
assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by or through
this Corporation, nor shall the Interested Shareholder have caused this
Corporation to make any major change in this Corporation's business or equity
capital structure, without approval by a majority of the Disinterested
Directors, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such Business
Combination, or otherwise.

             (j) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed
Business Combination in accordance with the then applicable  requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any
subsequent  provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed
to all Public Holders of this Corporation at least 30 days prior to the proposed
consummation  of  such  Business  Combination  (whether  or not  such  proxy  or
information  statement  is  required  to be  mailed  pursuant  to  such  Act  or
subsequent provisions). Such proxy or information statement shall contain at the
front thereof,  in a prominent place, any recommendations as to the advisability
(or  inadvisability)  of  the  Business   Combination  which  the  Disinterested
Directors,  or any of  them,  may have  furnished  in  writing  and,  if  deemed
advisable  by a  majority  of  the  Disinterested  Directors,  an  opinion  of a
reputable  investment  banking  firm as to the fairness (or lack of fairness) of
the terms of such  Business  Combination,  from the point of view of the  Public
Holders of any Voting Shares (such  investment  banking firm to be selected by a
majority of the Disinterested Directors, to be furnished with all information it
reasonably  requests,  and to be paid a  reasonable  fee for its  services  upon
receipt by this Corporation of such opinion).

         3.  The provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article VII shall not be
applicable to any particular Business Combination, and such Business Combination
shall require only such  affirmative  vote of the shareholders as is required by
law or any other provision of these Articles if such Business  Combination shall
have been approved by a majority of the  Disinterested  Directors then in office
even though less than a quorum.

         4.  A majority of the Disinterested Directors shall have the power and
duty to  interpret  all of the terms and  provisions  of this Article VII and to
determine,  on the basis of information  known to them, among other things,  (a)
whether a person is an Interested  Shareholder;  (b) the number of Voting Shares
beneficially  owned by any  person;  (c)  whether  a person is an  Affiliate  or
Associate  of another;  (d) whether a person has an  agreement,  arrangement  or
understanding  with another as to any matters  referred to in subparagraph 1 (b)
of this  Article  VII;  (e)  whether  the  assets  which are the  subject of any
Business  Combination,  or the  securities to be issued or  transferred  by this
Corporation  or any  Subsidiary in any Business  Combination,  have an aggregate
fair market value of $5,000,000 or more;  and (f) whether all of the  applicable
conditions set forth in paragraph 2 of this Article VII have been satisfied with
respect to any Business Combination.

                                       15

         5.  Nothing  contained in this Article VII shall be construed to
relieve any Interested Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.



                                  ARTICLE VIII

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles or the Bylaws of
this Corporation (and  notwithstanding  the fact that a lesser percentage may be
specified  by law,  these  Articles  or the  Bylaws  of this  Corporation),  the
affirmative  vote of the  holders of at least 75  percent  of the Voting  Shares
present  and  entitled to vote,  voting  together  as a single  class,  shall be
required  to amend,  alter or repeal,  or to adopt any  provisions  inconsistent
with,   Article  VII  and   paragraph  1  of  Article  VI  of  the  Articles  of
Incorporation,  and paragraph 1 of Section 9 of the Bylaws;  provided,  however,
that this Article VIII shall not apply to, and such 75 percent vote shall not be
required  for,  any   amendment,   alteration  or  repeal   recommended  to  the
shareholders by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, as defined in Article
VII, then in office.


                                   ARTICLE IX

         No director of this Corporation shall be personally liable to this
Corporation  or its  stockholders  for monetary  damages for breach of fiduciary
duty by that  director as a director;  provided,  however,  that this Article IX
shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director:  (a) for any breach of
the director's duty of loyalty to this Corporation or its stockholders;  (b) for
acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional  misconduct or a
knowing  violation  of law; (c) under  Minnesota  Statutes  Section  302A.559 or
80A.23;  (d) for any  transaction  from which the  director  derived an improper
personal  benefit;  or (e) for any act or omission  occurring  prior to the date
when this Article IX becomes effective.  If, after the stockholders approve this
provision,  the Minnesota  Business  Corporation Act, Minnesota Statutes Chapter
302A, is amended to authorize  corporate action further  eliminating or limiting
the personal  liability of  directors,  then the liability of a director of this
Corporation  shall  be  deemed  eliminated  or  limited  to the  fullest  extent
permitted by the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, as so amended. No amendment
to or  repeal  of this  Article  IX shall  apply to or have  any  affect  on the
liability or alleged  liability of any director of this  Corporation for or with
respect  to any  acts or  omissions  of such  director  occurring  prior to that
amendment or repeal.

Vice-President,  a Secretary  and  Treasurer and shall from time to time appoint
such other officers as they may deem proper.  The same person may hold more than

Directors  Emeritus,  in recognition of their long and faithful  service to this
Corporation.  Directors  Emeritus  shall have no duties or  responsibilities  in
connection with the management of the Corporation.

         The officers of the Corporation shall have such powers and duties,

offices respectively, as well as such powers and duties as from time to time may
be conferred upon them by the Board of Directors.

         The Board of Directors may, by unanimous affirmative action of the
entire  Board,  designate two or more of their number to constitute an Executive
Committee which, to the extent determined by unanimous affirmative action of the
entire  Board,  shall  have  and  exercise  the  authority  of the  Board in the
management  of the  business  of the  Corporation,  except  the  power  to  fill
vacancies  in the  Board  and the  power to  change  the  membership  of or fill
vacancies in said Committee.  Any such Executive Committee shall act only in the
interval  between  meetings  of the Board,  and shall be subject at all times to
control and direction of the Board.  By unanimous vote, the Board shall have the
power  at any  time to  change  the  membership  of such  Committee  and to fill
vacancies in it. The Executive  Committee may make such rules for the

conduct of its  business  and may  appoint  such  Chairman  and  committees  and
assistants as it may deem necessary. A majority of the members of said Committee
shall constitute a quorum.

         Section 10. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the
times  fixed by  resolution  of the Board,  or upon call of the  Chairman of the
Board, the President, or a Vice-President,  or any two Directors.  The Secretary
or  officer  performing  his or her duties  shall  give two days'  notice of all
meetings  of  Directors,  provided  that a meeting  may be held  without  notice
immediately  after the annual election,  and notice need not be given of regular
meetings held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Meetings may be held at
any time without  notice if all of the  Directors  are present,  or if those not
present waive notice,  either before or after the meeting.  Notice by mailing to
the usual  business or residence  address of the Director not less than the time
above specified before the meeting shall be sufficient.  A majority of the Board
shall  constitute a quorum.  Less than such a quorum shall have power to adjourn
any meeting from time to time without notice.

         Section 11. Any and all officers of this Corporation may be required at
any time to give bonds for the  faithful  discharge of their duties in such sum,
or sums, and with such sureties, as the Board of Directors may determine.

         Section 12. The term of office of all officers shall be until the next
election of  Directors  and until  their  respective  successors  are chosen and
qualify,  but any officer may be removed from office at any time by the Board of
Directors,  unless  otherwise  agreed by agreement in writing duly authorized by
the Board of Directors; and no agreement for the employment of any officer for a
longer period than one year shall be so authorized.

         Section 13. The officers of this Corporation shall have such powers and
duties as  generally  pertain to their  offices,  respectively,  as well as such
powers and duties as from time to time shall be conferred upon them by the Board
of Directors or the Executive Committee.

         In case any officer of the Corporation who shall have signed any bonds
or certificates of stock heretofore or hereafter  issued by the Corporation,  or
attested the seal  thereon,  or whose  facsimile  signature  appears on any bond
coupon or stock  certificates  shall cease to be such officer of the Corporation
before  the bonds or stock  certificates  so signed  or sealed  shall  have been
authenticated,   delivered   or  issued,   such  bonds  or  stock   certificates
nevertheless may be  authenticated,  delivered or issued with the same force and
effect as though the person or persons who had signed same or attested  the seal
thereon, or whose facsimile signature appears thereon, had not ceased to be such
officer of the Corporation.

         The Corporation shall reimburse or indemnify each present and future
Director and officer of the  Corporation  (and his or her heirs,  executors  and
administrators) for or against all expenses reasonably incurred by such Director
or officer in connection  with or arising out of any action,  suit or proceeding
in which such  Director  or officer may be involved by reason of being or having
been  a  Director  or  officer  of the  Corporation.  Such  indemnification  for
reasonable  expenses is to be to the fullest  extent  permitted by the Minnesota
Business  Corporation Act,  Minnesota Statutes Chapter 302A. By affirmative vote
of the Board of  Directors  or with  written  approval of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer,  such  indemnification  may be extended to include agents and
employees  who are not Directors or officers of the  Corporation,  but who would
otherwise  be  indemnified  for acts and  omissions  under  Chapter

                                       8

302A of the Minnesota  Business  Corporation Act, if such agent or employee were
an officer of the Corporation.

         Reasonable expenses may include reimbursement of attorneys' fees and
disbursements,  including  those  incurred  by a person  in  connection  with an
appearance as a witness.

         Upon written request to the Corporation and approval by the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer,  an agent or employee for whom  indemnification has
been  extended,  or an officer or Director may receive an advance for reasonable
expenses if such agent,  employee,  officer or Director is made or threatened to
be made a party to a proceeding involving a matter for which  indemnification is
believed to be available under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 302A.

         The foregoing rights shall not be exclusive of other rights to which
any Director or officer may otherwise be entitled and shall be available whether
or not the Director or officer continues to be a Director or officer at the time
of incurring such expenses and liabilities.

     Section 14. A Director of this Corporation shall not be disqualified by his
or her office  from  dealing or  contracting  with this  Corporation,  either as
vendor,  purchaser or otherwise,  nor shall any  transaction or contract of this
Corporation be void or voidable by reason of the fact that any Director,  or any
firm of which any Director is a member, or any corporation of which any Director
is a shareholder or director,  is in any way  interested in such  transaction or
contract,  provided that such transaction or contract is or shall be authorized,
ratified or  approved  either (1) by vote of a majority of a quorum of the Board
of Directors or of the Executive Committee, without counting in such majority of
quorum any Director so interested, or being a member of a firm so interested, or

shareholder or a director of a corporation  so  interested,  or (2) by vote at a
shareholders' meeting of the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares
of the stock of this  Corporation  entitled to vote, or by a writing or writings
signed by a  majority  of such  holders,  nor shall  any  Director  be liable to
account to this  Corporation  for any profit  realized by the  Director  from or
through any transaction or contract of this Corporation, authorized, ratified or
approved as aforesaid,  by reason of the fact that the Director,  or any firm of
which the Director is a member,  or any  corporation  of which the Director is a
shareholder  or  director,  was  interested  in such  transaction  or  contract;
provided however,  that this Corporation shall not lend any of its assets to any
of its officers or Directors,  nor to any of its shareholders on the security of
its own shares.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall  create any  liability in the
events above described or prevent the authorization, ratification or approval of
such contracts or transactions in any other manner provided by law.

         Section 15. The Board of Directors is authorized to select such
depository  or  depositories  as they  shall  deem  proper for the funds of this
Corporation.  All checks and drafts against such deposited funds shall be signed
by persons to be specified by the Chairman of the Board,  by the  President or a
Vice-President of the Corporation with the concurrence of its Treasurer.

         Section 16. The Board of Directors shall have power to authorize the
payment of  compensation  to the  Directors  for  services to this  Corporation,
including  fees for  attendance  at meetings of the Board of  Directors,  and to
determine the amount of such compensation and fees.

         Section 17. The corporate seal of this Corporation shall be in such
form as the Board of Directors shall prescribe.

         Section 18. The shareholders may alter or amend these Bylaws by a
majority vote of all the outstanding stock of this Corporation  entitled to vote

of the proposed  alteration or amendment.  The Board of Directors may also alter

of Directors  given at a duly convened  meeting of the Board of  Directors,  the
notice of which includes notice of the proposed alteration or amendment, subject
to the power of the shareholders to change or repeal such Bylaws;  provided that
the Board of Directors  shall not make or alter any Bylaws  fixing their number,
qualifications,  classifications,  or term of office,  or changing the number of
shares required to constitute a quorum for a shareholders' meeting.
