                        Kraft Foods Inc. and Subsidiaries
              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                                   (Unaudited)

Note 1. Background and Basis of Presentation:

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Kraft Foods Inc.
("Kraft"), together with its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the
"Company") are unaudited. It is the opinion of the Company's management that all
adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim results presented have
been reflected therein. All such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature.
Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year.

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related notes, and management's discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations, which appear in the Company's
Annual Report to Shareholders and which are incorporated by reference into the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 (the
"2001 Form 10-K").

Note 2.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards:

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets." As a result, the Company stopped recording the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as a charge to
earnings as of January 1, 2002. The Company estimates that net earnings and
diluted earnings per share ("EPS") would have been approximately $1.3 billion
and $0.88, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2001, and $743
million and $0.49, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2001, had
the provisions of the new standards been applied as of January 1, 2001. In
addition, the Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and
intangible assets for potential impairment. The Company completed its review
and did not have to record a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill
or other intangible assets as a result of these new standards.

At June 30, 2002, goodwill by reportable segment was as follows (in millions):

Cheese, Meals and Enhancers          $ 8,554
Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery     9,339
Beverages, Desserts and Cereals        2,144
Oscar Mayer and Pizza                    618
                                     -------
   Total Kraft Foods North America    20,655
                                     -------
Europe, Middle East and Africa         3,861
Latin America and Asia Pacific           394
                                     -------
   Total Kraft Foods International     4,255
                                     -------
   Total goodwill                    $24,910
                                     =======

              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                                   (Unaudited)

Intangible assets as of June 30, 2002 were as follows:

                                      Gross
                                    Carrying    Accumulated
                                     Amount    Amortization
                                    --------   ------------
                                         (in millions)

Non-amortizable intangible assets    $11,376
Amortizable intangible assets             55        $26
                                     -------        ---
   Total intangible assets           $11,431        $26
                                     =======        ===

Non-amortizable intangible assets substantially comprise brand names purchased
through the Nabisco acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily
of certain trademark licenses and non-compete agreements. The pre-tax
amortization expense for intangible assets was $4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2002 and $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2002.
Based upon the amortizable intangible assets recorded in the balance sheet at
June 30, 2002, amortization expense for each of the next five years is estimated
to be $8 million or less.

The increase in goodwill and other intangible assets, net, during the six months
ended June 30, 2002 of $358 million is primarily related to currency
translation.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company also adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which replaces SFAS No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 144 provides updated guidance concerning the
recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of
long-lived assets, expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a
component of an entity and eliminates the exemption to consolidation when
control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. The adoption of this new
standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF
Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid
to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." The adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14
and No. 00-25 resulted in a reduction of revenues of approximately $2.4 billion
in the first six months of 2001 and approximately $1.2 billion for the three
months ended June 30, 2001. In addition, the adoption reduced marketing,
administration and research costs in the first six months of 2001 by
approximately $2.4 billion and for the three months ended June 30, 2001 by
approximately $1.2 billion, while cost of sales increased by an insignificant
amount for both periods. The adoption of these EITF Issues had no impact on net
earnings or basic and diluted EPS.

Note 3. Related Party Transactions:

Philip Morris Companies Inc. ("Philip Morris"), which owns approximately 83.9%
of the Company's outstanding shares of capital stock, and certain of its
affiliates provide the Company with various services, including planning, legal,
treasury, accounting, auditing, insurance, human resources, office of the
secretary, corporate affairs, information technology and tax services. Billings
for these services, which were based on the cost to Philip Morris to provide
such services, were $158 million and $154 million for the six months ended June
30, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $77 million and $84 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

                                   (Unaudited)

Notes payable to parent and affiliates consisted of the following:

                                          June 30, 2002   December 31, 2001
                                          -------------   -----------------
                                                    (in millions)

Notes payable in 2009, interest at 7.0%       $1,900            $5,000
Short-term due to parent and affiliates
   reclassified as long-term                   2,100
                                              ------            ------
                                              $4,000            $5,000
                                              ======            ======

The 7.0% note has no prepayment penalty. During the first quarter of 2002, the
Company prepaid $1.0 billion of the 7.0% long-term note payable to Philip
Morris and, in May 2002, the Company prepaid an additional $2.1 billion.
During the second quarter of 2002, the Company borrowed $2.1 billion from Philip
Morris to retire commercial paper. Interest on these borrowings is based on the
average one-month London Interbank Offered Rate. This short-term obligation due
to Philip Morris of $2.1 billion was reclassified on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet as long-term notes due to parent and affiliates based upon the
Company's ability and intention to refinance these borrowings on a long-term
basis.

Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures:

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company acquired a biscuits business in
Australia for $62 million. During the first six months of 2001, the Company
purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria for an aggregate
cost of $80 million. The total cost of these and other small businesses
purchased during the first six months of 2002 and 2001 were $63 million and $97
million, respectively.

During the first six months of 2002, the Company sold several small North
American food businesses, most of which were previously classified as businesses
held for sale. The net revenues and operating results of the businesses held for
sale, which were not significant, were excluded from the Company's consolidated
statements of earnings and no gain or loss was recognized on these sales. During
the first six months of 2001, the Company sold several small domestic and
international food businesses. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of
businesses during the first six months of 2002 and 2001 were $84 million and
$9 million, respectively. The Company recorded pre-tax gains on these
transactions during the first six months of 2002 and 2001 of $3 million and
$8 million, respectively.

The operating results of businesses acquired and divested were not material to
the consolidated operating results of the Company in any of the periods
presented.

Note 5. Earnings Per Share:

Basic and diluted EPS were calculated using the following:

                                           For the Six Months Ended
                                                   June 30,

                                                 (in millions)

Net earnings                                    $1,594   $  831
                                                ======   ======

                                                ======   ======

                                          For the Three Months Ended
                                                  June 30,
                                          --------------------------

                                                (in millions)

Net earnings                                    $  901   $  505
                                                ======   ======

Weighted average shares for basic EPS            1,735    1,510

Plus: Incremental shares from assumed
   conversions of stock options                      3
                                                ------   ------

Weighted average shares for diluted EPS          1,738    1,510
                                                ======   ======

For the first six months and the second quarter of 2001, options on 21 million
shares of Class A common stock had no impact on the calculation of weighted
average shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive.

Note 6. Contingencies:

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings
arising out of the normal course of business, including a few cases in which
substantial amounts of damages are sought. While the results of litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome
of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 7. Segment Reporting:

The Company manufactures and markets packaged retail food products, consisting
principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals and various grocery
products through Kraft Foods North America, Inc. and Kraft Foods International,
Inc. Reportable segments for Kraft Foods North America, Inc. are organized and

million; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery, $1 million; Beverages, Desserts and
Cereals, $59 million; Oscar Mayer and Pizza, $7 million; and Latin America and

The 2002 integration related charges of $119 million included $21 million
relating to severance, $82 million relating to asset write-offs and $16 million
relating to other cash exit costs. Cash payments relating to this charge will
approximate $37 million, of which $1 million has been paid through June 30,

pre-tax charges to the consolidated statement of earnings to close or

segment.

Note 8. Financial Instruments:

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and its related amendment, SFAS
No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities." As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of these new standards did not
have a material effect on net earnings (less than $1 million) or accumulated
other comprehensive losses (less than $1 million).

During the six months and three months ended June 30, 2002, a pre-tax loss of $2
million was reported in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings due to
ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges. During the six months and three months
ended June 30, 2001, a pre-tax gain of $10 million and $9 million, respectively,
was reported in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings due to
ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges. At June 30, 2002, the Company is hedging

requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an
exit or disposal plan. Costs covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination
costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a
restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing or other exit or disposal
activity. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company will apply the
provisions of SFAS No. 146 prospectively to exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002.

Item 2.              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Environment

Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft"), together with its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as the "Company") is the largest branded food and beverage company
headquartered in the United States. Prior to June 13, 2001, the Company was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip Morris Companies Inc. ("Philip Morris"). On
June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of
280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock. After the IPO, Philip Morris
owns approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's capital
stock through its ownership of 49.5% of the Company's outstanding Class A common
stock, and 100% of the Company's Class B common stock. The Company's Class A
common stock has one vote per share while the Company's Class B common stock has
ten votes per share. Philip Morris holds 97.7% of the combined voting power of
the Company's outstanding common stock.

The Company conducts its global business through two subsidiaries: Kraft Foods
North America, Inc. ("KFNA") and Kraft Foods International, Inc. ("KFI"). KFNA
manages its operations by product category, while KFI manages its operations by
geographic region. KFNA's segments are Cheese, Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits,
Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages, Desserts and Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and
Pizza. KFNA's food service business within the United States and its businesses
in Canada and Mexico are reported through the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers
segment. KFI's segments are Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin America
and Asia Pacific.

The Company is subject to fluctuating commodity costs, currency movements and
competitive challenges in various product categories and markets, including a
trend toward increasing consolidation in the retail trade and consequent
inventory reductions, and changing consumer preferences. In addition, certain
competitors may have different profit objectives, and some competitors may be
more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates. To confront these
challenges, the Company continues to take steps to build the value of its
brands and improve its food business portfolio with new products and marketing
initiatives.

Fluctuations in commodity costs can cause retail price volatility, intensify
price competition and influence consumer and trade buying patterns. KFNA's and
KFI's businesses are subject to fluctuating commodity costs, including dairy,
coffee bean and cocoa costs. Dairy commodity costs on average in the second
quarter of 2002 have been lower than the levels incurred in the second quarter
of 2001. However, for the first six months of 2002, dairy commodity costs on
average have been higher than the levels incurred in the first six months of
2001. Coffee bean prices have been lower than in 2001, while cocoa bean prices
have been higher.

The food industry is subject to the possibility that consumers could lose
confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products. Products that
become adulterated or misbranded may need to be recalled. Manufacturers are
subject to product liability claims if consumption of their products causes
injury. The industry is also subject to rigorous food safety, ingredient
disclosure and labeling laws and regulations.

On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Nabisco for an aggregate purchase price, including assumed debt, of
approximately $19.2 billion. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase. During 2001, certain Nabisco businesses were reclassified to
businesses held for sale, including their estimated results of operations
through anticipated sale dates. These businesses have subsequently been sold
with the exception of one business that had been held for sale since the
acquisition of Nabisco. This business, which is no longer held for sale, has
been included in 2002 consolidated operating results. The closure of a number of
Nabisco domestic and international facilities resulted in severance and other
exit costs of $379 million, which were included in the adjustments for the
allocation of the Nabisco purchase price. The closures will result in the
termination of approximately 7,500 employees and will require total cash
payments of $373 million, of which approximately $170 million has been spent
through June 30, 2002. Substantially all of the closures will be completed by
the end of 2002.

The integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company has also resulted
in the closure or reconfiguration of several of the Company's existing
facilities. The aggregate charges to the Company's consolidated statement of
earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and integrate Nabisco were
originally estimated to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. In the
fourth quarter of 2001, the Company announced that it was offering a voluntary
retirement program to certain United States salaried employees. During the first
quarter of 2002, approximately 700 salaried employees accepted the benefits
offered by this program and elected to retire or terminate employment. The
Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $142 million related to the voluntary
retirement programs. In addition, during the first quarter of 2002, the Company
recorded pre-tax integration related charges of $27 million to consolidate
production lines in North America. During the second quarter of 2002, the
Company recorded a pre-tax integration related charge of $92 million for the
closing of a Kraft facility and other consolidation programs. The 2002
integration related charges of $119 million included $21 million relating to
severance, $82 million relating to asset write-offs and $16 million relating
to other cash exit costs. Cash payments relating to this charge will
approximate $37 million, of which $1 million has been paid through June 30,
2002. The majority of the remaining payments are expected to be made by
December 31, 2002. As of June 30, 2002, the aggregate pre-tax charges to the
consolidated statement of earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and
integrate Nabisco were $314 million, slightly above the original estimate.

During the first quarter of 2001, the Company sold a North American food
factory, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $29 million.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company purchased a biscuits business in
Australia for $62 million. During the first six months of 2001, the Company
purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria for an aggregate
cost of $80 million. The total cost of these and other small businesses
purchased during the first six months of 2002 and 2001 were $63 million and $97
million, respectively.

During the first six months of 2002, the Company sold several small North
American food businesses, most of which were previously classified as
businesses held for sale. The net revenues and operating results of the
businesses held for sale, which were not significant, were excluded from the
Company's consolidated statements of earnings and no gain or loss was recognized
on these sales. During the first six months of 2001, the Company sold several
small domestic and international food businesses. The aggregate proceeds
received from sales of businesses during the first six months of 2002 and 2001
were $84 million and $9 million, respectively. The Company recorded pre-tax
gains on these transactions during the first six months of 2002 and 2001 of
$3 million and $8 million, respectively.

The operating results of businesses acquired and divested were not material to
the consolidated operating results of the Company in any of the periods
presented.

Consolidated Operating Results

Several events occurred during the first six months of 2002 and 2001 that
affected the comparability of earnings. In order to isolate the financial
effects of these events, and to provide a more meaningful comparison of the
Company's results of operations, the following tables and the subsequent
discussion of the Company's consolidated operating results will refer to results
on a reported and pro forma basis. Reported results reflect average shares of
common stock outstanding during 2001. Pro forma results reflect average common
shares outstanding for 2001 based on the assumption that shares issued
immediately following the IPO were outstanding throughout 2001 and that,
effective January 1, 2001, the net proceeds of the IPO were used to retire a
portion of a long-term note payable used to finance the Nabisco acquisition. Pro
forma results also adjust for the results of operations divested since the
beginning of 2001 and certain other unusual items as detailed on the following
tables, including the cessation of goodwill amortization as if Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" had been in effect during
2001.

</TABLE>

Reported operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before
general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, was affected by the
following unusual items during the first six months and second quarter of 2002
and 2001:

o    Integration Charges- During the first six months and second quarter of
     2002, the Company recorded $119 million and $92 million, respectively, of
     pre-tax integration related charges relating to the consolidation of
     production lines, the closing of a facility and other consolidation
     programs. These charges were included in marketing, administration and
     research costs for the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment; the Biscuits,
     Snacks and Confectionery segment; the Beverages, Desserts and Cereals
     segment; the Oscar Mayer and Pizza segment; and the Latin America and
     Asia Pacific segment.

o    Voluntary Retirement Programs- In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
     announced that it was offering a voluntary retirement program to certain
     United States salaried employees. During the first quarter of 2002,
     approximately 700 salaried employees accepted the benefits offered by these
     programs and elected to retire or terminate employment. As a result, the
     Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $142 million in the first quarter of
     2002.

o    Businesses Held for Sale- During 2001, certain Nabisco businesses were
     reclassified to businesses held for sale, including their estimated results
     of operations through anticipated sale dates. These businesses have
     subsequently been sold with the exception of one business that had been
     held for sale since the acquisition of Nabisco. This business, which is no
     longer held for sale, has been included in 2002 reported operating results
     and has been included as an adjustment to arrive at pro forma results for
     2001.

o    Sale of Food Factory- The Company sold a North American food factory during
     the first quarter of 2001, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $29 million
     recorded in the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment.

In addition, reported net earnings were also affected by the following during
the first six months and second quarter of 2002:

o    Amortization of Intangibles- On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
     No. 141 and SFAS No. 142. As a result, the Company stopped recording the
     amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as a charge
     to earnings. The Company estimates that reported net earnings and diluted
     earnings per share ("EPS") would have been approximately $1.3 billion and
     $0.88, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2001, and
     $743 million and $0.49, respectively, for the three months ended June 30,
     2001, had the provisions of the new standards been applied in that period.

Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2002

Reported volume for the first six months of 2002 increased 493 million pounds
(5.6%) over the comparable 2001 period. On a pro forma basis, volume increased
2.3% over the first six months of 2001, due primarily to increases in the
Beverages, Desserts and Cereals segment, as well as contributions from new
products and acquisitions.

Reported net revenues for the first six months of 2002 decreased $10 million
(0.1%) from the comparable 2001 period. On a pro forma basis, net revenues
decreased 0.8% from the first six months of 2001 as the adverse effects of
currency exchange rates and lower sales prices on coffee products (driven by
commodity-related price declines) were partially offset by the impact of
acquisitions and higher volume/mix.

Reported operating companies income decreased $15 million (0.5%) from the first
six months of 2001, due primarily to the pre-tax charges related to the
voluntary retirement programs and integration related costs, partially offset by
lower marketing, administration and research costs. On a pro forma basis,
operating companies income increased $205 million (6.7%), due to higher
operating companies income in all segments.

Currency movements decreased net revenues by $248 million and operating
companies income by $14 million from the first six months of 2001. Decreases in
net revenues and operating companies income are due primarily to the strength of
the U.S. dollar against the euro and certain Latin American currencies.

Reported interest and other debt expense, net, decreased $482 million from the
first six months of 2001. This decrease was due primarily to lower debt levels
after the repayment of Nabisco acquisition borrowings with the proceeds from the
Company's IPO. On a pro forma basis, interest and other debt expense, net,
decreased $180 million in 2002 from $631 million in the first six months of
2001. This decrease in pro forma interest expense is due to the use of free cash
flow to repay debt and ongoing efforts to refinance higher-rate notes payable to
Philip Morris.

During the first six months of 2002, the Company's reported effective tax rate
decreased by 10.0 percentage points to 35.5% as compared with the first six
months of 2001, due primarily to the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142,
under which the Company is no longer required to amortize goodwill and
indefinite life intangible assets as a charge to earnings.

Reported diluted and basic EPS, which were both $0.92 for the first six months
of 2002, increased by 64.3% from 2001, due primarily to lower interest expense
and the elimination of substantially all goodwill amortization


                                      -22-



<PAGE>


in accordance with the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 141 and No. 142. Reported
net earnings of $1.6 billion for the first six months of 2002 increased $763
million (91.8%) over the comparable period of 2001. On a pro forma basis,
diluted and basic EPS, which were $1.01 and $1.02, respectively, for the first
six months of 2002, increased by 17.4% and 18.6%, respectively, over the first
six months of 2001, due primarily to higher operating results in all segments
and lower interest expense. Pro forma net earnings of $1.8 billion for the first
six months of 2002 increased $272 million (18.3%) over the comparable period of
2001.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2002

Reported volume for the second quarter of 2002 increased 315 million pounds
(7.0%) over the comparable 2001 period. On a pro forma basis, volume increased
2.1% over the second quarter of 2001 due primarily to increases in the
Beverages, Desserts and Cereals segment, contributions from new products and
acquisitions.

Reported net revenues for the second quarter of 2002 increased $40 million
(0.5%) over the comparable 2001 period. On a pro forma basis, net revenues
decreased 1.1% from the second quarter of 2001 due primarily to the adverse
effects of currency exchange rates, and lower selling prices in response to
lower commodity costs, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and higher
volume/mix.

Reported operating companies income increased $17 million (1.0%) over the second
quarter of 2001, reflecting volume gains, and productivity and synergy savings,
partially offset by integration costs. On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased $100 million (6.0%), due to higher operating companies income
across all segments in KFNA and the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment.

Currency movements have decreased net revenues by $118 million and operating
companies income by $8 million from the second quarter of 2001. Decreases in net
revenues and operating companies income are due primarily to the strength of the
U.S. dollar against certain Latin American currencies.

Reported interest and other debt expense, net, decreased $230 million from the
second quarter of 2001. This decrease was due primarily to lower debt levels
after the repayment of a portion of Nabisco acquisition borrowings with the
proceeds from the Company's IPO. On a pro forma basis, interest and other debt
expense, net, decreased $92 million in 2002 from $313 million in the second
quarter of 2001. This decrease in pro forma interest expense is due to the use
of free cash flow to repay debt and ongoing efforts to refinance higher-rate
notes payable to Philip Morris.

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company's reported effective tax rate
decreased by 9.2 percentage points to 35.5% as compared with the second quarter
of 2001, due primarily to the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, under
which the Company is no longer required to amortize goodwill and indefinite life
intangible assets as a charge to earnings.

Reported diluted and basic EPS, which were both $0.52 for the second quarter of
2002, increased by 57.6% over 2001, due primarily to lower interest expense and
the elimination of substantially all goodwill amortization in accordance with
the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 141 and No. 142. Reported net earnings of
$901 million for the second quarter of 2002 increased $396 million (78.4%) over
the comparable period of 2001. On a pro forma basis, diluted and basic EPS,
which were both $0.55 for the second quarter of 2002, increased by 17.0% over
the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to higher operating results in KFNA
and KFI as well as lower interest expense. Pro forma net earnings of $960
million for the second quarter of 2002 increased $140 million (17.1%) over the
comparable period of 2001.

Reported volume for the first six months of 2002 increased 7.1% over the
comparable period of 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume for the first six months
of 2002 increased 2.2% over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to
increased shipments in the Beverages, Desserts and Cereals segment, as well as
contributions from new products.

During the first six months of 2002, reported net revenues increased $200
million (1.9%) over the first six months of 2001, due primarily to the inclusion
in 2002 of a business that was previously held for sale ($108 million) and
higher volume/mix ($107 million), partially offset by lower net pricing ($12
million). On a pro forma basis, net revenues increased 0.9%.

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 decreased
$29 million (1.2%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the
charge for voluntary retirement programs ($135 million) and higher charges in
2002 related to integration costs ($73 million), partially offset by lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($128 million, including synergy
savings), higher volume/mix ($30 million) and favorable margins ($31 million,
including productivity savings). On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased 6.6%, driven by higher volume/mix, favorable margins and lower
marketing, administration and research costs.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFNA's reportable
segments.

Cheese, Meals and Enhancers. Reported volume in the first six months of 2002
increased 10.5% over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the
inclusion in 2002 of a business that was previously held for sale. On a pro
forma basis, volume in the first six months of 2002 decreased 1.0% from the
comparable period of 2001, due primarily to lower shipments in cheese and U.S.
food service. Cheese volume declined due to aggressive competitive activity and
the challenges associated with translating lower commodity costs into lower
retail prices during the second quarter of 2002. Shipments to food service
customers were also lower,


                                      -25-



<PAGE>


driven by the exit of low-margin businesses and distributor consolidation in the
food service industry. Meals volume increased, reflecting higher shipments of
macaroni & cheese dinners and the 2001 acquisition of It's Pasta Anytime.

During the first six months of 2002, reported net revenues increased $86 million
(1.9%) over the first six months of 2001, due primarily to the impact of
businesses held for sale ($124 million), partially offset by lower volume/mix
($42 million). On a pro forma basis, net revenues decreased 0.8% from the
comparable period of 2001, due primarily to lower volume/mix.

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 decreased
$7 million (0.6%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the
charge for voluntary retirement programs ($60 million), partially offset by
lower marketing, administration and research costs ($55 million). On a pro forma
basis, operating companies income increased 4.4%, driven by lower marketing,
administration and research costs.

Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery. Reported and pro forma volume in the first
six months of 2002 increased 1.1% from the comparable period of 2001, led by
gains across all three businesses. Biscuits volume increased driven by volume
gains in cookies, crackers and pet snacks. In snacks, volume increased due
primarily to higher shipments of nuts to non-grocery channels. Confectionery
volume also increased aided by new product introductions.

During the first six months of 2002, reported and pro forma net revenues
increased $37 million (1.5%) over the first six months of 2001, due primarily to
higher net pricing ($32 million) and higher volume/mix.

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 increased
$79 million (19.2%) over the comparable period of 2001, due to lower marketing,
administration and research costs ($50 million, the majority of which related to
lower marketing expenses, including synergy savings) and higher net pricing. On
a pro forma basis, operating companies income increased 20.2%.

Beverages, Desserts and Cereals. Reported volume in the first six months of 2002
increased 8.1% over the comparable period in 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume
in the first six months of 2002 increased 8.8% over the comparable period of
2001, due primarily to higher shipments of ready-to-drink beverages. Coffee
volume also increased, driven by merchandising programs and packaging
innovations. In the desserts business, volume increased in dry packaged desserts
and frozen toppings, which benefited from holiday programs, and in ready-to-eat
desserts, aided by new products. Cereal volume declined due primarily to
estimated reductions in trade inventory.

During the first six months of 2002, reported net revenues increased $48 million
(2.1%) over the first six months of 2001, due primarily to higher volume/mix
($108 million), partially offset by lower net pricing ($38 million, due
primarily to coffee commodity-related price reductions) and the impact of
businesses held for sale ($16 million). On a pro forma basis, net revenues
increased 3.1%.

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 decreased
$81 million (11.9%) from the comparable period of 2001, primarily reflecting the
charge for integration costs ($59 million), the charge for the voluntary
retirement programs ($47 million) and unfavorable margins ($11 million),
partially offset by higher volume/mix ($40 million). On a pro forma basis,
operating companies income increased 3.2%, due primarily to higher volume/mix.

Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Reported and pro forma volume in the first six months of
2002 increased 1.6% over the comparable period of 2001, due to volume gains in
processed meats and frozen pizza. The processed meats business recorded volume
gains in hot dogs, bacon, lunch combinations and soy-based meat alternatives.
Volume in the frozen pizza business also increased, driven by new products and
expanded distribution of existing products.

During the first six months of 2002, reported and pro forma net revenues
increased $29 million (1.9%) over the first six months of 2001, due primarily to
higher volume/mix ($34 million), partially offset by lower net pricing.

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 decreased
$20 million (6.4%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the
charges for voluntary retirement programs ($25 million) and integration related
costs ($7 million), and unfavorable commodity costs, partially offset by lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($20 million). On a pro forma
basis, operating companies income increased 3.8%.

Reported volume for the first six months of 2002 increased 1.6% over the first
six months of 2001, due primarily to volume growth in the Europe, Middle East
and Africa segment. On a pro forma basis, volume for the first six months of
2002 increased 2.5% over the comparable period of 2001, as both segments
benefited from acquisitions and new products.

During the first six months of 2002, reported net revenues decreased $210
million (5.2%) from the first six months of 2001, due primarily to unfavorable
currency movements ($243 million) and lower volume/mix ($60 million), partially
offset by the impact of acquisitions ($74 million). On a pro forma basis, net
revenues decreased 5.3%.

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 increased
$14 million (2.6%) over the first six months of 2001, due primarily to lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($76 million), partially offset by
lower volume/mix ($25 million), the charge for integration costs ($17 million),
unfavorable currency movements ($14 million) and the charge for voluntary
retirement programs ($7 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased 7.1%.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFI's reportable
segments.

Europe, Middle East and Africa. Reported and pro forma volume for the first six
months of 2002 increased 3.7% over the comparable period of 2001, benefiting
from acquisitions and driven by volume growth in most countries across the
segment. Snacks volume increased, driven by higher confectionery and salty
snacks volume in several markets and an acquisition of businesses in Russia and
Poland, partially offset by lower volume in Germany. In beverages, coffee volume
grew, driven by Sweden, the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy and the Ukraine, and
acquisitions in Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria. Refreshment beverages volume also
increased, driven by powdered beverages in the Middle East, Turkey and Morocco.
Cheese volume declined due to increased price competition in the European Union,
partially offset by volume gains in the Middle East. In convenient meals, volume
increased driven by lunch combinations in the United Kingdom, and canned meats
volume in Italy against a weak comparison in 2001. Grocery volume also
increased, benefiting from higher sales of spoonable dressings in Germany, as
well as pourable dressings and ready-to-serve desserts in the United Kingdom.

Reported and pro forma net revenues for the first six months of 2002 decreased
$66 million (2.3%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to
unfavorable currency movements ($72 million) and lower net pricing ($47 million,
due primarily to commodity-driven coffee price decreases), partially offset by
the 2001 acquisitions of coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria and
confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland ($58 million).

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 increased
$23 million (6.3%) over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to
favorable margins ($26 million) and acquisitions ($7 million), partially offset
by unfavorable currency movements and the charge for voluntary retirement
programs. On a pro forma basis, operating companies income increased 7.7%.

Latin America and Asia Pacific. Reported volume for the first six months of 2002
decreased 1.2% from the comparable period in 2001, due primarily to the impact
of businesses held for sale, divested businesses and the impact of weak
economies in select countries, partially offset by gains across a number of
markets and by the 2002 acquisition of a biscuits business in Australia. On a
pro forma basis, volume for the first six months of 2002 increased 0.8% over the
comparable period of 2001. Snacks volume increased, driven primarily by higher
biscuits volume in Brazil and Indonesia, confectionery volume in Brazil and by
the 2002 acquisition of a biscuits business in Australia, partially offset by
lower volume in Argentina and China. Beverages volume increased, due primarily
to growth in refreshment beverages in Brazil, Argentina, the Philippines and
Venezuela. Cheese volume decreased due primarily to lower sales in Latin America
and Japan, partially offset by higher cheese volume in the Philippines and
Indonesia. Grocery volume decreased, due primarily to lower sales in Latin
America and price competition in Australia.

During the first six months of 2002, reported net revenues decreased $144
million (12.3%) from the first six months of 2001, due primarily to unfavorable
currency movements ($171 million) and lower volume/mix ($55 million), partially
offset by higher net pricing ($39 million) and the 2002 acquisition of a
biscuits business in Australia. On a pro forma basis, net revenues decreased
12.4%.

Reported operating companies income for the first six months of 2002 decreased
$9 million (5.2%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to
unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($33 million), lower volume/mix ($27
million), the charge for integration costs ($17 million) and unfavorable
currency ($11 million), partially offset by lower marketing, administration and
research costs ($80 million, including synergy savings). On a pro forma basis,
operating companies income increased 5.8%.

Reported volume for the second quarter of 2002 increased 8.7% over the
comparable period of 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume for the second quarter
of 2002 increased 2.0% over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to
increased shipments in the Beverages, Desserts and Cereals segment and the
Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery segment, including contributions from new
products.

During the second quarter of 2002, reported net revenues increased $140 million
(2.6%) over the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to the impact of
businesses held for sale ($122 million), and higher volume/mix ($76 million),
partially offset by lower net pricing ($55 million). On a pro forma basis, net
revenues increased 0.4%, as the favorable impact of volume growth was partially
offset by the impact of product mix and reduced prices in response to lower
commodity costs.

Reported operating companies income for the second quarter of 2002 increased $16
million (1.2%) over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to favorable
margins ($28 million), lower marketing, administration and research costs ($26
million, including synergy savings), higher volume/mix ($26 million) and the
impact of businesses held for sale ($9 million), partially offset by the charge
for integration costs ($75 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased 6.0%, driven by volume growth and productivity and synergy
savings.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFNA's reportable
segments.

Cheese, Meals and Enhancers. Reported volume in the second quarter of 2002
increased 10.3% over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the
inclusion in 2002 of a business that was previously held for sale. On a pro
forma basis, volume in the second quarter of 2002 decreased 1.5% from the
comparable period of 2001, as volume declines in the cheese and food service
businesses were partially offset by volume gains in meals and enhancers. Cheese
volume declined due to aggressive competitive activity and the challenges
associated with translating lower commodity costs into lower retail prices.
Shipments to food service customers also declined driven by the exit of
low-margin, non-branded businesses and distributor consolidation in the food
service industry. Meals volume increased, reflecting higher shipments of
macaroni & cheese dinners and the 2001 acquisition of It's Pasta Anytime.
Enhancers volume also increased, reflecting higher shipments of steak sauce,
pourable dressings and barbecue sauce.

During the second quarter of 2002, reported net revenues increased $6 million
(0.3%) over the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to the impact of
businesses held for sale ($69 million), partially offset by lower volume/mix
($42 million) and lower net pricing ($23 million). On a pro forma basis, net
revenues decreased 2.6% from the comparable period of 2001.

Reported operating companies income for the second quarter of 2002 increased $27
million (4.5%) over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to favorable
margins ($34 million, driven by lower dairy commodity costs and productivity
savings) and lower marketing, administration and research costs ($15 million),
partially offset by lower volume/mix ($18 million). On a pro forma basis,
operating companies income increased 4.9%, driven by lower dairy commodity costs
and productivity savings.

Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery. Reported volume in the second quarter of
2002 increased 13.3% over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the
impact of businesses held for sale. On a pro forma basis, volume in the second
quarter of 2002 increased 2.9% over the comparable period in 2001. Biscuits
volume increased due primarily to an increase in cracker volume driven by new
product introductions. Cookie volumes also increased driven by the core cookie
business and new product introductions. In snacks, volume increased due
primarily to higher shipments of snacking nuts. Confectionery volume also
increased, aided by the launch of new products.

During the second quarter of 2002, reported net revenues increased $105 million
(8.8%) over the second quarter of 2001, due to the impact of businesses held for
sale ($53 million), higher volume/mix ($44 million) and higher net pricing ($10
million). On a pro forma basis, net revenues increased 4.2%.

Reported operating companies income for the second quarter of 2002 increased $45
million (18.3%) over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to favorable
margins ($22 million), higher volume/mix ($15 million) and lower marketing,
administration and research costs (reflecting synergy savings). On a pro forma
basis, operating companies income increased 17.7%, driven by higher volume and
synergy savings.

Beverages, Desserts and Cereals. Reported volume in the second quarter of 2002
increased 7.1% over the comparable period in 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume
in the second quarter of 2002 increased 7.5% over the comparable period of 2001,
due primarily to higher shipments of ready-to-drink beverages. Coffee volume
also increased, driven by merchandising programs and packaging innovation. In
the desserts business, volume increased in all major categories, including dry
packaged and ready-to-eat desserts, frozen toppings and nutrition/energy bars.
Cereal volume declined due primarily to estimated reductions in trade inventory.

During the second quarter of 2002, reported net revenues increased $31 million
(2.8%) over the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to higher volume/mix ($59
million), partially offset by lower net pricing ($25 million). On a pro forma
basis, net revenues increased 3.0%.

Reported operating companies income for the second quarter of 2002 decreased $50
million (14.7%) from the comparable period of 2001, primarily reflecting the
charge for integration costs ($59 million) and unfavorable margins ($16
million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($24 million). On a pro forma
basis, operating companies income increased 2.0%, driven primarily by higher
volume/mix.

Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Reported and pro forma volume in the second quarter of
2002 increased 1.4% over the comparable period of 2001, due to volume gains in
processed meats and frozen pizza. The processed meats business recorded volume
gains in hot dogs, lunch combinations and soy-based meat alternatives, which
were aided by new product introductions. Volume in the frozen pizza business
also increased, driven by stuffed crust pizza and expanded distribution of
existing products.

During the second quarter of 2002, reported and pro forma net revenues decreased
$2 million (0.3%) from the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to lower net
pricing ($17 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($15 million).

Reported volume for the second quarter of 2002 increased 2.2% over the second
quarter of 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume for the second quarter of 2002
increased 2.4% over the comparable period of 2001, with gains in both segments,
benefiting from acquisitions, growth in developing markets and new products.

During the second quarter of 2002, reported net revenues decreased $100 million
(4.9%) from the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to unfavorable currency
movements ($114 million) and lower volume/mix ($61 million), partially offset by
the impact of acquisitions ($41 million) and higher net pricing ($18 million).
On a pro forma basis, net revenues decreased 5.1%.

Reported operating companies income for the second quarter of 2002 increased $1
million (0.3%) over the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($33 million, including synergy
savings and other operating efficiencies), favorable margins ($9 million,
including

productivity savings) and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the
charge for integration costs ($17 million), lower volume/mix ($22 million) and
unfavorable currency movements ($8 million). On a pro forma basis, operating
companies income increased 6.0%, resulting primarily from productivity and
synergy savings.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFI's reportable
segments.

Europe, Middle East and Africa. Reported and pro forma volume for the second
quarter of 2002 increased 3.7% over the comparable period of 2001, driven by
acquisitions and volume growth in most countries across the segment, partially
offset by a decline in Germany. Snacks volume increased, driven by higher
confectionery volume reflecting new product introductions and the acquisition
of businesses in Russia and Poland, moderated by a decline in Germany,
reflecting the difficult competitive price environment. In beverages, volume
decreased as lower coffee shipments were partially offset by growth in
refreshment beverages. Cheese volume increased due to higher volume in the
Middle East, Africa, Spain and across Nordic markets. In convenient meals,
volume increased, driven by higher canned meats volume in Italy, against a weak
comparison in 2001, and lunch combinations in the United Kingdom. Grocery volume
also increased, benefiting from higher sales of spoonable dressings in Germany,
including new product introductions.

Reported and pro forma net revenues for the second quarter of 2002 decreased $12
million (0.8%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to lower net
pricing ($21 million, due primarily to commodity-driven coffee price decreases),
lower volume/mix ($17 million) and unfavorable currency movements, partially
offset by the 2001 acquisition of a coffee business in Bulgaria and
confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland ($32 million).

Reported and pro forma operating companies income for the second quarter of 2002
increased $20 million (10.4%) over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily
to favorable margins ($18 million), the impact of acquisitions and favorable
currency movements, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and
research costs.

Latin America and Asia Pacific. Reported volume for the second quarter of 2002
increased 0.2% over the comparable period in 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume
for the second quarter of 2002 increased 0.6% over the comparable period of
2001, as growth in numerous markets and the acquisition of a biscuits business
in Australia were partially offset by declines in certain countries due to the
impact of weak economies and lower results in China. Snacks volume increased,
driven by volume gains in biscuits, which benefited from new product
introductions and line extensions in Brazil and Indonesia, and the acquisition
of a biscuits business in Australia, partially offset by a decline in Argentina
due to the impact of a weak economy and lower biscuits volume in China due to
distributor inventory reductions. Beverages volume increased, due primarily to
the growth of powdered beverages in Brazil, Argentina, the Philippines and
Venezuela. Cheese volume decreased due to lower sales in Latin America and
Japan, partially offset by higher volume in the Philippines and Indonesia.
Grocery volume decreased due primarily to lower sales in Latin America and
Australia.

During the second quarter of 2002, reported net revenues decreased $88 million
(14.4%) from the second quarter of 2001, due primarily to unfavorable currency
movements ($108 million) and lower volume/mix ($44 million), partially offset by
higher net pricing ($39 million), the 2002 acquisition of a biscuits business in
Australia and the impact of businesses held for sale. On a pro forma basis, net
revenues decreased 15.1%.

Reported operating companies income for the second quarter of 2002 decreased $19
million (17.9%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to lower
volume/mix ($22 million), the charge for integration costs ($17 million),
unfavorable currency movements ($10 million) and unfavorable costs, partially
offset by lower marketing, administration and research costs ($38 million,
including synergy savings and other operating efficiencies). On a pro forma
basis, operating companies income decreased 1.9%.

Financial Review

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

During the first six months of 2002, net cash provided by operating activities
was $1.1 billion compared with $628 million in the comparable 2001 period. The
increase in net cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to higher
net earnings in 2002, and cash payments made in the first quarter of 2001
relative to severance and change in control costs arising from the Nabisco
acquisition as well as the payment of taxes on the gain of a business sold in
2000.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

During the first six months of 2002, net cash used in investing activities was
$405 million, compared with $515 million in the first six months of 2001. The
decrease in net cash used primarily reflects lower purchases of businesses in
2002 and higher cash received from the sales of businesses in 2002.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

During the first six months of 2002, net cash used in financing activities was
$763 million, compared with $113 million during the first six months of 2001.
The increase in cash used was due primarily to dividends paid during 2002.
During 2002, the Company issued $2.5 billion of global bonds, which were offset
by debt repayments. In 2001, the proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock
were used to repay notes payable to parent and affiliates and, as a result, had
no impact on financing cash flows.

Debt and Liquidity

Debt. The Company's total debt, including intercompany amounts payable to Philip
Morris, was $15.6 billion at June 30, 2002 and $16.0 billion at December 31,
2001. A prepayment of $3.1 billion on the 7.0% note payable to Philip Morris and
payments on short-term borrowings were partially offset by an increase in
amounts due to parent and affiliates and long-term debt. The Company's
debt-to-equity ratio was 0.63 at June 30, 2002 and 0.68 at December 31, 2001.

In April 2002, the Company filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which the Company may sell debt
securities and/or warrants to purchase debt securities in one or more offerings
up to a total amount of $5.0 billion. In May 2002, the Company issued $2.5
billion of global bonds under the shelf registration. The bond offering included
$1.0 billion of five-year notes bearing interest at a rate of 5.25% and $1.5
billion of 10-year notes bearing interest at a rate of 6.25%. The net proceeds
from the offering were used to retire maturing long-term debt in the amount of
$400 million and to prepay a portion (approximately $2.1 billion) of the
Company's 7.0% long-term note payable to Philip Morris. At June 30, 2002, the
Company had $2.5 billion of capacity remaining under its existing $5.0 billion
shelf registration statement.

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company borrowed $2.1 billion from Philip
Morris to retire commercial paper, $2.0 billion of which had previously been
reclassified as long-term debt. Interest on these borrowings is based on the
average one-month London Interbank Offered Rate. This short-term obligation due
to Philip Morris of $2.1 billion was reclassified on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet as long-term notes due to parent and affiliates based upon the
Company's ability and intention to refinance these borrowings on a long-term
basis.

Credit Lines. At June 30, 2002, the Company and its subsidiaries maintained
credit lines with a number of lending institutions amounting to approximately
$6.8 billion. Certain of these credit lines were used to support commercial
paper borrowings of $243 million at June 30, 2002, the proceeds of which were
used for general corporate purposes. Approximately $800 million of these credit
lines are used to meet the short-term working capital needs of the Company's
international businesses. At June 30, 2002, the Company's credit facilities
included a $2.0 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility expiring in July 2006
and a $4.0 billion, 364-day


                                      -34-



<PAGE>


revolving credit facility expiring in July 2002. In July 2002, the Company's
existing $4.0 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility was terminated and was
replaced by a new $3.0 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility that expires
in July 2003. As a result, the amount of total credit lines declined to
approximately $5.8 billion. These credit facilities require the maintenance of
a minimum net worth, as defined, of $18.2 billion, which the Company exceeded
at June 30, 2002. The Company does not currently anticipate any difficulty in
continuing to exceed this covenant requirement. The foregoing revolving credit
facilities do not include any other covenants that could require an acceleration
of maturity or the posting of collateral. The five-year revolving credit
facility enables the Company to reclassify short-term debt on a long-term basis.
At June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, $243 million and $2.0 billion,
respectively, of commercial paper borrowings that the Company intends to
refinance were also reclassified as long-term debt. The Company expects to
continue to refinance long-term and short-term debt from time to time. The
nature and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt and the
proportionate amount of each can be expected to vary as a result of future
business requirements, market conditions and other factors.

Guarantees and Commitments. At June 30, 2002, the Company was contingently
liable for guarantees and commitments of $48 million. These include surety bonds
related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to letters of
credit. Guarantees do not have, and are not expected to have, a significant
impact on the Company's liquidity.

                                   ----------

The Company believes that its cash from operations, existing credit facilities
and access to global capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet
its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and payment of its
anticipated quarterly dividends.

                                   ----------

Equity and Dividends

Dividends paid in the first six months of 2002 were $451 million. During the
second quarter of 2002, the Company declared its regular quarterly dividend of
$0.13 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. The present annualized
dividend rate is $0.52 per common share. The declaration of dividends is subject
to the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend on various
factors, including the Company's net earnings, financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the
Company's board of directors.

On June 21, 2002, the Company's board of directors approved the repurchase from
time to time of up to $500 million of the Company's Class A common stock solely
to satisfy the obligations of the Company to provide shares under its 2001
Performance Incentive Plan, 2001 Compensation Plan for non-employee directors,
and other plans where options to purchase the Company's Class A common stock are
granted to employees of the Company. At July 31, 2002, no shares had been
repurchased.

Market Risk

The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in
various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial instruments
to manage its foreign currency and commodity exposures, which primarily relate
to forecasted transactions and interest rate exposures. Derivative financial
instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposures to market
risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices
and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party
to leveraged derivatives. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception
and throughout the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature and
relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge
transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for
hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected
terms of a forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must
be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. Financial instruments
qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness
between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged,


                                      -35-



<PAGE>


both at inception and throughout the hedged period. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are
effective as hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Accordingly, the Company decreased accumulated other
comprehensive losses by $7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2002.
This reflects a decrease in the fair value of derivatives of $6 million and the
transfer of deferred losses to earnings of $13 million. For the three months
ended June 30, 2002, the Company increased accumulated other comprehensive
losses by $16 million. This reflects a decrease in the fair value of derivatives
of $18 million and the transfer of deferred losses to earnings of $2 million.
The fair value of all derivative financial instruments has been calculated based
on active market quotes. During the six months and three months ended June 30,
2002, a pre-tax loss of $2 million was reported in the condensed consolidated
statements of earnings due to ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges. During the
six months and three months ended June 30, 2001, a pre-tax gain of $10 million
and $9 million, respectively, was reported in the condensed consolidated
statements of earnings due to ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange rates. The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and
foreign currency options to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates from third-party and intercompany forecasted transactions. At
June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the Company had option and forward foreign
exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $539 million and $431
million, respectively, for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies.

Commodities. The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted
purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Company's
businesses. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward contracts, as cash
flow hedges, primarily for coffee, cocoa, milk, cheese and wheat. Commodity
futures and options are also used to hedge the price of certain commodities,
including milk, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn, sugar and soybean oil. At June 30,
2002 and December 31, 2001, the Company had net long commodity positions of $527
million and $589 million, respectively.

Interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of
an insignificant portion of its long-term debt. The differential to be paid or
received is accrued and recognized as interest expense. If an interest rate swap
agreement is terminated prior to maturity, the realized gain or loss is
recognized over the remaining life of the agreement if the hedged amount remains
outstanding, or immediately if the underlying hedged exposure does not remain
outstanding. If the underlying exposure is terminated prior to the maturity of
the interest rate swap, the unrealized gain or loss on the related interest rate
swap is recognized in earnings currently. At June 30, 2002, the aggregate
notional principal amount of those agreements, which converted fixed-rate debt
to variable-rate debt, was $102 million. Aggregate maturities at June 30, 2002
were $29 million in 2003 and $73 million in 2004. During the quarter ended June
30, 2002, there was no ineffectiveness relating to these fair value hedges.

                                   ----------

Use of the above-mentioned derivative financial instruments has not had a
material impact on the Company's financial position at June 30, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, or the Company's results of operations for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2002 or the year ended December 31, 2001.

                                   ----------

Contingencies

of contingencies.

New Accounting Standards

On July 30, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146,
"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an
exit or disposal plan. Costs covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination
costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a
restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing or other exit or disposal
activity. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company will apply the
provisions of SFAS No. 146 prospectively to exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002.

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations"
and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." As a result, the
Company stopped recording the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life
intangible assets as a charge to earnings as of January 1, 2002. The Company
estimates that net earnings and diluted EPS would have been approximately $1.3
billion and $0.88, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2001, and
approximately $743 million and $0.49, respectively, for the three months ended
June 30, 2001, had the provisions of the new standards been applied as of
January 1, 2001. In addition, the Company is required to conduct an annual
review of goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment. The Company
completed its review and did not have to record a charge to earnings for an
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of these new
standards.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company also adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which replaces SFAS No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 144 provides updated guidance concerning the
recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of
long-lived assets, expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a
component of an entity and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation
when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. The adoption of this
new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF
Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid
to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." The adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14
and No. 00-25 resulted in a reduction of revenues of approximately $2.4 billion
in the first six months of 2001 and approximately $1.2 billion for the three
months ended June 30, 2001. In addition, the adoption reduced marketing,
administration and research costs in the first six months of 2001 by
approximately $2.4 billion and for the three months ended June 30, 2001 by
approximately $1.2 billion, while cost of sales increased by an insignificant
amount for both periods. The adoption of these EITF Issues had no impact on net
earnings or basic and diluted EPS.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral
forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in its reports to
shareholders, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. One can identify
these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects,"
"plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "continues," "estimates," "intends,"
"projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. One can also
identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or
current facts. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is hereby identifying
important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by or on
behalf of the Company; any such statement is qualified by reference to the
following cautionary statements.


                                      -37-

Each of the Company's segments is subject to intense competition, changes in
consumer preferences, the effects of changing prices for its raw materials and
local economic conditions. Their results are dependent upon their continued
ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new
consumer trends, to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand
portfolios in order to compete effectively with lower priced products in a
consolidating environment at the retail and manufacturing levels, and to improve
productivity. The Company's results are also dependent on its ability to
successfully integrate and derive cost savings from the integration of Nabisco's
operations with the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to the effects
of foreign economies, currency movements and fluctuations in levels of customer
inventories. The food industry continues to be subject to recalls if products
become adulterated or misbranded, liability if product consumption causes
injury, ingredient disclosure and labeling laws and regulations and the
possibility that consumers could lose confidence in the safety and quality of
certain food products. Developments in any of these areas, which are more fully
described above and which descriptions are incorporated into this section by
reference, could cause the Company's results to differ materially from results
that have been or may be projected by or on behalf of the Company. The Company
cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. The
Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be
made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

          Legal Proceedings

          The Company's subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal
          proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including
          the matters discussed below. While the results of litigation cannot be
          predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome
          of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the
          Company's results of operations or financial position.

          In May 2002, the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in California
          by the American Environmental Safety Institute against several major
          chocolate manufacturers alleging that the defendants' chocolate
          products contain "potentially dangerous levels of lead and cadmium."
          The suit alleges that these levels which are not disclosed on the
          product labels are a violation of California's Proposition 65, which
          requires a warning on products containing chemicals which are "known
          to the State" to be carcinogens or reproductive toxicants. The suit is
          in its early stages, and various procedural motions and defenses are
          being pursued. The Company feels that the suit is without merit, and
          the California Attorney General has publicly stated that the case is
          without merit.

          National Cheese Exchange Cases: Since 1996, seven putative class
          actions have been filed by various dairy farmers alleging that the
          Company and others engaged in a conspiracy to fix and depress the
          prices of bulk cheese and milk through their trading activity on the
          National Cheese Exchange. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and equitable
          relief and unspecified treble damages. Two of the actions were
          voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs after class certification was
          denied. Three cases were consolidated in state court in Wisconsin, and
          in November 1999, the court granted the Company's motion for summary
          judgment. In June 2001, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the
          trial court's ruling dismissing the cases. In April 2002, the
          Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's
          ruling. In April 2002, the Company's motion for summary judgment
          dismissing the case was granted in a case pending in the United States
          District Court for the Central District of California. In June 2002,
          the parties settled this dispute on an individual (non-class) basis,
          and plaintiffs dismissed their appeal. A case in Illinois state court
          has been settled and dismissed.

          Environmental Matters

          In May 2001, the State of Ohio notified the Company that it may be
          subject to an enforcement action for alleged past violations of the
          Company's wastewater discharge permit at its production facility in
          Farmdale, Ohio. The State has offered to attempt to negotiate a
          settlement of this matter, and the Company has accepted the offer to
          do so. The State has not yet identified the relief it may seek in this
          matter.

          The Company is potentially liable for certain environmental matters
          arising from the operations of Nabisco's former wholly-owned
          subsidiary, Rowe Industries. Rowe operated a small engine
          manufacturing facility in Sag Harbor, New York in the 1950s, 1960s and
          early 1970s that used various solvents. About 20 homes downgradient
          from the site were connected to public drinking water in the mid-1980s
          after solvents were detected in their individual wells. Since 1996,
          three toxic tort cases have been brought against Nabisco in New York
          state court, collectively by or on behalf of approximately 80
          individuals, including 17 minors. The first case was filed on March 6,
          1996, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and was
          subsequently dismissed by the trial court. That decision was affirmed
          on appeal. The other two cases both were filed on January 3, 2000,
          also in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. That court granted
          defendant's summary judgment motion as to all but one of the
          plaintiffs in each of the remaining cases, and the plaintiffs have now
          withdrawn

          their appeal of this ruling. The Company filed summary judgment
          motions as to the remaining two plaintiffs, who are seeking
          unspecified damages for alleged personal injury and fear or risk of
          cancer.

          Twelve lawsuits have been filed against Del Monte Corporation (which
          previously was affiliated with Nabisco or a former affiliate) and six
          other pesticide users and manufacturers for alleged injuries to
          workers caused by exposure to dibromochloropropane ("DBCP"). The
          complaints were served on Del Monte Corporation on approximately
          February 21, 2002. The complaints allege that Del Monte Corporation
          purchased DBCP in mid-1979 with the objective of using it in
          Nicaragua. The lawsuits, which were instituted between September 17,
          2001 and October 1, 2001 with the Third Civil District Judge for
          Managua (Nicaragua), collectively seek unspecified costs and expenses
          and compensatory and punitive damages of approximately $720 million.
          In March 2002, a third party agreed to defend and indemnify the
          Company for each of these claims. In June 2002, a stipulated order
          quashing service of the complaints and any further substantially
          similar complaints was entered. The Company expects that this order
          should effectively end its involvement in these cases.
