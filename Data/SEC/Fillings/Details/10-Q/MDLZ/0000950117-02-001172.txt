                        Kraft Foods Inc. and Subsidiaries
              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                                   (Unaudited)

Note 1.  Background and Basis of Presentation:
- ----------------------------------------------

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Kraft Foods Inc.,
together with its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Company") are
unaudited. It is the opinion of the Company's management that all adjustments
necessary for a fair statement of the interim results presented have been
reflected therein. All such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. Net
revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative
of results that may be expected for the entire year.

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related notes, and management's discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations which appear in the Company's
Annual Report to Shareholders and which are incorporated by reference into the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 (the
"2001 Form 10-K").

Note 2.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards:
- -----------------------------------------------

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets." As a result, the Company stopped recording the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as a charge to
earnings during the first quarter of 2002. The Company estimates that net
earnings and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") would have been approximately
$564 million and $0.39, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2001
had the provisions of the new standards been applied as of January 1, 2001. In
addition, the Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and
intangible assets for potential impairment. At adoption, the Company did not
have to record a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or other
intangible assets as a result of these new standards.

At March 31, 2002, goodwill by reportable segment was as follows (in millions):

<TABLE>

                                                         =======
</TABLE>

There were no material changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the
three months ended March 31, 2002.

Intangible assets as of March 31, 2002 were as follows:

                                                                              (in millions)
<S>                                                                   <C>                    <C>
Non-amortizable intangible assets                                     $11,376
Amortizable intangible assets                                              56                $25
                                                                      -------                ---
       Total intangible assets                                        $11,432                $25
                                                                      =======                ===
</TABLE>

Non-amortizable intangible assets substantially comprise brand names purchased
through the Nabisco acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily
of certain trademark licenses and non-compete agreements. The pre-tax
amortization expense for intangible assets during the quarter ended March 31,
2002 was $2 million. Based upon the amortizable intangible assets recorded in
the balance sheet at March 31, 2002, amortization expense for each of the next
five years is estimated to be $8 million or less.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company also adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which replaces SFAS No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 144 provides updated guidance concerning the
recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of
long-lived assets, expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a
component of an entity and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation
when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. The adoption of this
new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2002.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF
Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid
to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." The adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14
and No. 00-25 resulted in a reduction of revenues of approximately $1.2 billion
in the first quarter of 2001. In addition, the adoption reduced marketing,
administration and research costs in the first quarter of 2001 by approximately
$1.2 billion, while cost of sales increased by an insignificant amount. The
adoption of these EITF Issues had no impact on net earnings or basic and diluted
EPS.

Note 3.  Related Party Transactions:
- ------------------------------------

Philip Morris Companies Inc. ("Philip Morris"), which owns approximately 83.9%
of the Company's outstanding shares of capital stock, and certain of its
affiliates provide the Company with various services, including planning, legal,
treasury, accounting, auditing, insurance, human resources, office of the
secretary, corporate affairs, information technology and tax services. Billings
for these services, which were based on the cost to Philip Morris to provide
such services, were $81 million and $70 million for the three months ended March
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These services increased $11 million as Philip
Morris provided information technology and financial services that were
previously performed by the Company.

The Company also has a long-term note payable to Philip Morris (payable in 2009,
interest at 7.00% per annum) of $4.0 billion at March 31, 2002 and $5.0 billion
at December 31, 2001. This note has no prepayment penalty, and the Company must
repay some or all of the note with the proceeds from external debt offerings.
During the first three months of 2002, the Company prepaid $1.0 billion to
Philip Morris on this note.

Note 4.  Acquisitions and Divestitures:
- ---------------------------------------

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company acquired a biscuits business in
Australia for $62 million. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company
purchased coffee businesses in Romania and Morocco.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold several small North American
food businesses which were previously classified as businesses held for sale.
The aggregate proceeds received in these transactions during the first quarter
of 2002 were $81 million.

The operating results of businesses acquired and divested were not material to
the consolidated operating results of the Company in any of the periods
presented.

</TABLE>

There were no options outstanding in the first quarter of 2001.

Note 6.  Contingencies:
- -----------------------

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings
arising out of the normal course of business, including a few cases in which
substantial amounts of damages are sought. While the results of litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome
of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the shares of
the Company's Class A common stock sold in the IPO, some of the underwriters of
the IPO provided written copies of a "pre-marketing feedback" form to certain
potential purchasers of the Company's Class A common stock. The feedback form
was for internal use only and was designed to elicit orally certain information
from designated accounts as part of designing strategy in connection with the
IPO. This form may have constituted a prospectus that did not meet the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

If the distribution of this form by the underwriters did constitute a violation
of the Securities Act of 1933, persons who received this form, directly or
indirectly, and who purchased the Company's Class A common stock in the IPO may
have the right, for a period of one year from the date of the violation, to
obtain recovery

of the consideration paid in connection with their purchase of the Company's
Class A common stock or, if they had already sold the stock, attempt to recover
losses resulting from their purchase of the Class A common stock. The Company
cannot determine the amount of Class A common stock that was purchased by
recipients of the "pre-marketing feedback" form. However, the Company does not
believe that any attempts to rescind these purchases or to recover these losses
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. Interest and other debt
expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and,
accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are not included
in the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management.

                                   (Unaudited)

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $142
million related to employee acceptances under the previously announced voluntary
retirement program. This charge was included in marketing, administration and
research costs for the following segments: Cheese, Meals and Enhancers, $60
million; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery, $3 million; Beverages, Desserts and
Cereals, $47 million; Oscar Mayer and Pizza, $25 million; Europe, Middle East
and Africa, $5 million; and Latin America and Asia Pacific, $2 million. In
addition, during the first quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $27 million to consolidate production lines in North America. This
charge was included in marketing, administration and research costs for the
Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment.

During the first quarter of 2001, the Company sold a North America food factory
which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $29 million. The loss was included in
marketing, administration and research costs for the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers
segment.

Note 8.  Financial Instruments:
- -------------------------------

During the quarters ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, ineffectiveness related to
fair value hedges and cash flow hedges was not material. At March 31, 2002, the
Company is hedging forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next
seventeen months and expects substantially all amounts reported in accumulated
other comprehensive losses to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of
earnings within the next twelve months.

Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income
taxes, as follows (in millions):

Item 2.              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Environment

Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft"), together with its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as the "Company") is the largest branded food and beverage company
headquartered in the United States. Prior to June 13, 2001, the Company was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip Morris Companies Inc. ("Philip Morris"). On
June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of
280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock. After the IPO, Philip Morris
owns approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's capital
stock through its ownership of 49.5% of the Company's outstanding Class A common
stock, and 100% of the Company's Class B common stock. The Class A common stock
has one vote per share while the Company's Class B common stock has ten votes
per share. Therefore, Philip Morris holds 97.7% of the combined voting power of
the Company's outstanding common stock.

The Company conducts its global business through two units: Kraft Foods North
America, Inc. ("KFNA") and Kraft Foods International, Inc. ("KFI"). KFNA manages
its operations by product category, while KFI manages its operations by
geographic region. KFNA's segments are Cheese, Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits,
Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages, Desserts and Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and
Pizza. KFNA's food service business within the United States and its businesses
in Canada and Mexico are reported through the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers
segment. KFI's segments are Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin America
and Asia Pacific.

The Company is subject to fluctuating commodity costs, currency movements and
competitive challenges in various product categories and markets, including a
trend toward increasing consolidation in the retail trade and consequent
inventory reductions, and changing consumer preferences. In addition, certain
competitors may have different profit objectives and some international
competitors may be less susceptible to currency exchange rates. To confront
these challenges, the Company continues to take steps to build the value of its
brands and improve its food business portfolio with new products and marketing
initiatives.

Fluctuations in commodity costs can cause retail price volatility, intensify
price competition and influence consumer and trade buying patterns. KFNA's and
KFI's businesses are subject to fluctuating commodity costs, including dairy,
coffee bean and cocoa costs. Dairy commodity costs on average have been higher
than the levels incurred in the first quarter of 2001. Cocoa bean prices have
also been higher, while coffee bean prices have been lower than in 2001.

The food industry is subject to the possibility that consumers could lose
confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products. Products that
become adulterated or misbranded may need to be recalled. Manufacturers are
subject to product liability claims if consumption of their products causes
injury. The industry is also subject to rigorous food safety, ingredient
disclosure and labeling laws and regulations.

On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Nabisco for an aggregate purchase price, including assumed debt, of
approximately $19.2 billion. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase. During 2001, certain Nabisco businesses were reclassified to
businesses held for sale, including their estimated results of operations
through anticipated sale dates. These businesses have subsequently been sold
with the exception of one business that had been held for sale since the
acquisition of Nabisco. This business has been included in 2002 reported
operating results. The closure of a number of Nabisco domestic and international
facilities resulted in severance and other exit costs of $379 million, which
were included in the adjustments for the allocation of the Nabisco purchase
price. The closures will result in the termination of approximately 7,500
employees and will require total cash payments of $373 million, of which
approximately $100 million has been spent through March 31, 2002. Substantially
all of the closures will be completed by the end of 2002.

The integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company will also result
in the closure or reconfiguration of several of the Company's existing
facilities. The aggregate charges to the Company's consolidated statement of
earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and integrate Nabisco were
originally estimated to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. In the
fourth quarter of 2001, the Company announced that it was offering a voluntary
retirement program to certain United States salaried employees. During the first

                                      -15-




<PAGE>


quarter of 2002, approximately 700 salaried employees accepted the benefits
offered by this program and elected to retire or terminate employment. As a
result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $142 million related to the
voluntary retirement program. In addition, during the first quarter of 2002, the
Company recorded pre-tax integration charges of $27 million to consolidate
production lines in North America. As of March 31, 2002, the Company had
recorded cumulative pre-tax charges of $222 million related to these actions.

During the first quarter of 2001, the Company sold a North American food factory
which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $29 million.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company purchased a biscuits business in
Australia for $62 million. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company
purchased coffee businesses in Romania and Morocco.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold several small North American
food businesses which were previously classified as businesses held for sale.
The aggregate proceeds received in these transactions during the first quarter
of 2002 were $81 million.

The operating results of businesses acquired and divested were not material to
the consolidated operating results of the Company in any of the periods
presented.

Consolidated Operating Results
- ------------------------------

Several events occurred during the first quarter of 2002 and 2001 that affected
the comparability of earnings. In order to isolate the financial effects of
these events, and to provide a more meaningful comparison of the Company's
results of operations, the following tables and the subsequent discussion of the
Company's consolidated operating results will refer to results on a reported and
pro forma basis. Reported results reflect an average of 1.455 billion shares
outstanding during 2001. Pro forma results reflect average common shares
outstanding of 1.735 billion for 2001 based on the assumption that shares issued
immediately following the IPO were outstanding throughout 2001 and that,
effective January 1, 2001, the net proceeds of the IPO were used to retire a
portion of a long-term note payable used to finance the Nabisco acquisition.
Pro forma results also adjust for the results of operations divested since the
beginning of 2001 and certain other unusual items as detailed on the following
tables, including the cessation of goodwill amortization as if Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" had been in effect during
2001.

Reported volume for the first quarter of 2002 increased 178 million pounds
(4.2%) over the comparable 2001 period. On a pro forma basis, volume increased
2.5% over the first quarter of 2001 due primarily to increases in the Beverages,
Desserts and Cereals segment, contributions from new products and acquisitions.

Reported net revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased $50 million (0.7%)
from the comparable 2001 period as the adverse effects of currency exchange
rates and lower sales prices on coffee products (driven by commodity-related
price declines) were partially offset by higher volume/mix and the impact of
acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, net revenues decreased 0.4% from the first
quarter of 2001.

Reported operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before
general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, was affected by the
following unusual items during the first quarter of 2002 and 2001:

o  Integration Charges- During the first quarter of 2002, the Company recorded
   $27 million of pre-tax integration charges to consolidate production lines in
   North America. This charge was included in marketing, administration and
   research costs for the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment.

o  Voluntary Retirement Programs- In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
   announced that it was offering a voluntary retirement program to certain
   salaried employees in the United States. As of March 31, 2002, approximately
   700 salaried employees accepted the benefits offered by these programs and
   elected to retire or terminate employment. As a result, the Company recorded
   a pre-tax charge of $142 million in the first quarter of 2002.

o  Businesses Held for Sale- During 2001, certain Nabisco businesses were
   reclassified to businesses held for sale, including their estimated results
   of operations through anticipated sale dates. These businesses have
   subsequently been sold with the exception of one business that had been held
   for sale since the acquisition of Nabisco. This business has been included in
   2002 reported operating results and has been included as an adjustment to
   arrive at pro forma results for 2001.

o  Sale of Food Factory- The Company sold a North American food factory during
   the first quarter of 2001, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $29 million
   recorded in the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment.

In addition, reported net earnings were also affected by the following unusual
item during the first quarter of 2002:

o  Amortization of Intangibles- On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.
   141 and SFAS No. 142. As a result, the Company is no longer required to
   amortize goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as a charge to
   earnings. The Company estimates that reported net earnings and diluted
   earnings per share ("EPS") would have been approximately $564 million and
   $0.39, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2001 had the
   provisions of the new standards been applied in that period.

Reported operating companies income decreased $32 million (2.3%) from the first
quarter of 2001, due primarily to the pre-tax charge related to the voluntary
retirement programs. On a pro forma basis, operating companies income increased
$105 million (7.4%), due to higher operating companies income in all segments.

Currency movements have decreased net revenues by $130 million and operating
companies income by $6 million from the first quarter of 2001. Decreases in net
revenues and operating companies income are due primarily to the strength of the
U.S. dollar against the euro and certain Latin American currencies. Although the
Company cannot predict future movements in currency exchange rates, the strength
of the U.S. dollar, if sustained during 2002, could continue to have an
unfavorable impact on net revenues and operating companies income comparisons.

Reported interest and other debt expense, net, decreased $252 million from the
first quarter of 2001. This decrease was due primarily to lower debt levels
after the repayment of Nabisco acquisition borrowings with the proceeds from the
Company's IPO. On a pro forma basis, interest and other debt expense, net,
decreased $88 million in 2002 from $318 million in the first quarter of 2001.
This decrease in pro forma interest expense is due to the use of free cash flow
to repay debt and ongoing efforts to externally refinance debt payable to Philip
Morris.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's reported effective tax rate
decreased by 11.1 percentage points to 35.5% as compared with the first quarter
of 2001, due primarily to the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, under
which the Company is no longer required to amortize goodwill and indefinite life
intangible assets as a charge to earnings.

                                      -18-




<PAGE>


Reported diluted and basic EPS, which were both $0.40 for the first quarter of
2002, increased by 81.8% from 2001, due primarily to lower interest expense and
the elimination of substantially all goodwill amortization in accordance with
the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 141 and No. 142. Reported net earnings of
$693 million for the first quarter of 2002 increased $367 million, or more than
100%, from the comparable period of 2001. On a pro forma basis, diluted and
basic EPS, which were both $0.46 for the first quarter of 2002, increased by
17.9% over the first quarter of 2001, due primarily to higher operating results
in all segments and lower interest expense. Pro forma net earnings of $802
million for the first quarter of 2002 increased $132 million (19.7%) over the
comparable period of 2001.

Reported volume for the first quarter of 2002 increased 5.3% over the comparable
period of 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume for the first quarter of 2002
increased 2.5% over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to increased
shipments in the Beverages, Desserts and Cereals segment, as well as
contributions from new products.

During the first quarter of 2002, reported net revenues increased $60 million
(1.1%) over the first quarter of 2001, due primarily to higher pricing ($43
million) and higher volume/mix. On a pro forma basis, net revenues increased
1.5%.

Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 decreased $45
million (3.9%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the charge
for voluntary retirement programs ($135 million) and higher dairy commodity
costs, partially offset by lower marketing, administration and research costs
($102 million) and higher volume/mix. On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased 7.2%, driven by volume growth and productivity and synergy
savings, partially offset by higher dairy commodity costs.

The following discusses operating results within each of Kraft Foods North
America's reportable segments.

Cheese, Meals and Enhancers. Reported volume in the first quarter of 2002
increased 10.7% over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the
inclusion in 2002 of a business that was previously held for sale. On a pro
forma basis, volume in the first quarter of 2002 decreased 0.5% from the
comparable period of 2001, as increased shipments to retail stores were more
than offset by a decline in U.S. food service volume and the exit from the
lower-margin, non-branded cheese business. Meals volume increased, reflecting
higher shipments of macaroni & cheese dinners and the 2001 acquisition of It's
Pasta Anytime. Cheese volume also increased, reflecting higher shipments of
natural cheese and process cheese loaves.

During the first quarter of 2002, reported net revenues increased $80 million
(3.8%) over the first quarter of 2001, due primarily to the businesses held for
sale ($55 million) and higher pricing ($22 million). On a pro forma basis, net
revenues increased 1.2% over the comparable period of 2001.

Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 decreased $34
million (6.9%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to the charge
for voluntary retirement programs ($60 million) and unfavorable margins due to
higher dairy commodity costs ($16 million), partially offset by lower marketing,
administration and research costs ($40 million). On a pro forma basis, operating
companies income increased 3.8%, driven by lower marketing, administration and
research costs (reflecting synergy and productivity savings), partially offset
by higher dairy commodity costs.

Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery. Reported volume in the first quarter of 2002
decreased 9.5% from the comparable period of 2001, as certain businesses
included in the first quarter 2001 results were subsequently designated as
businesses held for sale. On a pro forma basis, volume in the first quarter of
2002 decreased 0.9% from the comparable period in 2001. Biscuits volume
decreased versus a strong shipment quarter in 2001. Confectionery volume also
declined reflecting accelerated customer purchases in December of 2001 in
advance of a price increase and competitive activity in the non-chocolate candy
business. In snacks, volume increased due primarily to higher shipments of nuts
to non-grocery channels.

During the first quarter of 2002, reported net revenues decreased $68 million
(5.5%) from the first quarter of 2001, due to businesses held for sale ($53
million) and lower volume/mix ($37 million), partially offset by higher pricing
($22 million). On a pro forma basis, net revenues decreased 1.3%.

Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 increased $34
million (20.6%) over the comparable period of 2001, due to lower marketing,
administration and research costs ($48 million, the majority of which related to
lower marketing expenses and synergy savings), partially offset by lower
volume/mix ($14 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies income
increased 23.9%.

Beverages, Desserts and Cereals. Reported volume in the first quarter of 2002
increased 9.2% over the comparable period in 2001. On a pro forma basis, volume
in the first quarter of 2002 increased 10.2% over the comparable period of 2001,
due primarily to higher shipments of ready-to-drink beverages. Coffee volume
also increased, driven by merchandising programs. In the desserts business,
volume increased due primarily to merchandising programs in frozen toppings and
dry packaged and ready-to-eat desserts. Cereal volume declined due primarily to
the timing of shipments to non-grocery customers.

During the first quarter of 2002, reported net revenues increased $17 million
(1.5%) over the first quarter of 2001, due primarily to higher volume/mix ($49
million), partially offset by lower pricing ($13 million, due primarily to
coffee commodity-related price reductions) and businesses held for sale ($16
million). On a pro forma basis, net revenues increased 3.1%.

Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 decreased $31
million (9.1%) from the comparable period of 2001, primarily reflecting the
charge for voluntary retirement programs ($47 million),

                                      -21-




<PAGE>


partially offset by higher volume/mix ($16 million). On a pro forma basis,
operating companies income increased 4.4%.

Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Reported and pro forma volume in the first quarter of
2002 increased 1.8% over the comparable period of 2001, due to volume gains in
processed meats and frozen pizza. The processed meats business recorded volume
gains in luncheon meats, hot dogs, bacon, lunch combinations and soy-based meat
alternatives. Volume in the frozen pizza business also increased, driven by new
products and expanded distribution of existing products.

During the first quarter of 2002, reported and pro forma net revenues increased
$31 million (4.2%) over the first quarter of 2001 due primarily to higher
volume/mix ($19 million) and higher pricing ($12 million).

Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 decreased $14
million (9.5%) from the comparable period of 2001 due primarily to the charge
for voluntary retirement programs ($25 million), partially offset by lower
marketing, administration and research costs. On a pro forma basis, operating
companies income increased 7.4%.

</TABLE>

Reported volume for the first quarter of 2002 increased 0.9% over the first
quarter of 2001, due primarily to volume growth in the Europe, Middle East and
Africa segment, partially offset by lower volume in the Latin America and Asia
Pacific segment. On a pro forma basis, volume for the first quarter of 2002
increased 2.5% over the comparable period of 2001, with gains in both segments
benefiting from acquisitions and new products.

During the first quarter of 2002, reported net revenues decreased $110 million
(5.6%) from the first quarter of 2001, due primarily to unfavorable currency
movements ($129 million) and lower pricing ($26 million, due primarily to
commodity-related coffee price reductions), partially offset by the impact of
acquisitions ($33 million). On a pro forma basis, net revenues decreased 5.5%.

Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 increased $13
million (5.4%) over the first quarter of 2001, due primarily to lower marketing,
administration and research costs ($43 million), partially offset by unfavorable
margins ($16 million), the charge for voluntary retirement programs ($7 million)
and unfavorable currency ($6 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased 8.4%.

The following discusses operating results within each of Kraft Foods
International's reportable segments.

Europe, Middle East and Africa. Reported and pro forma volume for the first
quarter of 2002 increased 3.6% from the comparable period of 2001, driven by
volume growth in several countries across the segment. Snacks volume increased,
driven by higher confectionery and salty snacks volume. Confectionery volume
benefited from gains in several markets and the recent acquisition of businesses
in Russia and Poland. Salty snacks volume growth was driven by gains in the
Nordic area and Central and Eastern Europe. In beverages, volume increased in
both coffee and refreshment beverages. Coffee volume grew in Germany, Sweden,
Poland and the Ukraine, and benefited from acquisitions in Bulgaria, Romania and
Morocco. Refreshment beverages volume increased, driven by powdered soft drinks
in the Middle East, the Czech Republic and Turkey. In cheese, volume declined
due to lower volume in the European Union reflecting increased price
competition, partially offset by volume gains in the Middle East. In convenient
meals, volume increased driven by lunch combinations in the United Kingdom and
canned meats volume in Italy against a weak comparison in 2001. Grocery volume
also increased, benefiting from higher sales of spoonable dressings in Italy and
Spain, as well as pourable dressings and ready-to-serve desserts in the United
Kingdom.

Reported and pro forma net revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased $54
million (3.9%) from the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to unfavorable
currency movements ($66 million) and lower pricing ($26 million, due primarily
to commodity-driven coffee price decreases), partially offset by higher
volume/mix ($12 million) and the 2001 acquisitions of coffee businesses in
Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria and confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland
($26 million).

<PAGE>



Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 increased $3
million (1.7%) over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to favorable
margins ($8 million), higher volume/mix and acquisitions, partially offset by
unfavorable currency movements ($5 million) and the charge for voluntary
retirement programs ($5 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased 4.7%.

Latin America and Asia Pacific. Reported volume for the first quarter of 2002
decreased 2.7% from the comparable period in 2001, due primarily to businesses
held for sale, divested businesses and the impact of weak economies in
Argentina, Venezuela and several Asian markets, partially offset by gains across
a number of markets. On a pro forma basis, volume for the first quarter of 2002
increased 1.1% over the comparable period of 2001. Snacks volume increased,
driven primarily by higher biscuits volume in Brazil and Peru, confectionery
volume in Brazil and by the 2002 acquisition of a biscuits business in
Australia, partially offset by lower volume in Argentina, Venezuela and China.
Beverages volume increased, due primarily to growth in powdered soft drinks in
most markets and coffee in China. Cheese volume decreased due primarily to
increased price competition in Australia and lower sales in Japan and the
Caribbean, partially offset by higher cheese volume in the Philippines. Grocery
volume decreased, due primarily to economic weakness in Argentina and Venezuela.
The Company expects continued erosion of the economic climate in Argentina to
negatively affect results during the remainder of 2002.

During the first quarter of 2002, reported net revenues decreased $56 million
(9.9%) from the first quarter of 2001, due primarily to unfavorable currency
movements ($63 million) and lower volume/mix ($11 million), partially offset by
the 2002 acquisition of a biscuits business in Australia. On a pro forma basis,
net revenues decreased 9.4%.

Reported operating companies income for the first quarter of 2002 increased $10
million (14.9%) over the comparable period of 2001, due primarily to lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($42 million, reflecting synergy
savings), partially offset by lower margins ($24 million) and lower volume/mix
($5 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies income increased 17.9%.

Financial Review
- ----------------

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
- -----------------------------------------

During the first quarter of 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was
$216 million compared with $2 million in the comparable 2001 period. The
increase in net cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to higher
net earnings in 2002 and cash payments in the first quarter of 2001 relative to
severance and change in control costs arising from the Nabisco acquisition as
well as taxes on the gain of a business sold in 2000.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
- -------------------------------------

During the first quarter of 2002, net cash used in investing activities was $171
million, compared with $194 million in the first quarter of 2001. This decrease
in net cash used primarily reflects cash received from the sales of businesses
in 2002, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures and higher cash
used in purchases of businesses.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
- -------------------------------------

During the first quarter of 2002, net cash used in financing activities was $54
million, compared with $164 million provided by financing activities during the
first quarter of 2001. The difference was due primarily to dividends paid during
the first quarter of 2002.

                                      -24-

Debt and Liquidity
- ------------------

Debt. The Company's total debt, including intercompany accounts payable to
Philip Morris, was $16.0 billion at March 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. A
prepayment of $1.0 billion on the 7.00% note payable to Philip Morris was offset
by an increase in short-term borrowings and amounts due to parent and
affiliates. The Company's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.67 at March 31, 2002 and
0.68 at December 31, 2001.

In April 2002, the Company filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which the Company may sell debt
securities and/or warrants to purchase debt securities in one or more offerings
up to a total amount of $5.0 billion. The Company plans to use the future
proceeds from the sale of the offered securities to refinance indebtedness to
Philip Morris, to refinance maturing long-term indebtedness and for general
corporate purposes.

Credit Facilities. The Company has a $2.0 billion 5-year revolving credit
facility expiring in July 2006 and a $4.0 billion 364-day revolving credit
facility expiring in July 2002. Including these revolving credit facilities, the
Company's total credit facilities were approximately $6.8 billion. Certain of
these credit facilities were used to support $3.0 billion of commercial paper
borrowings at March 31, 2002, the proceeds of which were used for general
corporate purposes. A portion of the facilities is used to meet the short-term
working capital needs of the Company's international businesses. Certain of the
credit facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth, as defined, of
$18.2 billion, which the Company exceeded at March 31, 2002. The Company does
not currently anticipate any difficulty in continuing to exceed this covenant
requirement. The foregoing revolving credit facilities do not include any other
covenants that could require an acceleration of maturity or the posting of
collateral. The five-year revolving credit facility enables the Company to
reclassify short-term debt on a long-term basis. At March 31, 2002 and December
31, 2001, $2.0 billion of commercial paper borrowings that the Company intends
to refinance were reclassified as long-term debt. The Company expects to
continue to refinance long-term and short-term debt from time to time. The
nature and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt and the
proportionate amount of each can be expected to vary as a result of future
business requirements, market conditions and other factors.

Guarantees and Commitments. At March 31, 2002, the Company was contingently
liable for guarantees and commitments of $45 million. These include surety bonds
related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to letters of
credit. Guarantees do not have, and are not expected to have, a significant
impact on the Company's liquidity.

                               -------------------

The Company believes that its cash from operations, existing credit facilities
and access to global capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet
its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and payment of its
anticipated quarterly dividends.

Dividends
- ---------

Dividends paid in the first quarter of 2002 were $225 million. During the first
quarter of 2002, the Company declared its regular quarterly dividend of $0.13
per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. The present annualized
dividend rate is $0.52 per common share. The declaration of dividends is subject
to the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend on various
factors, including the Company's net earnings, financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the
Company's board of directors.

Market Risk
- -----------

The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in
various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial instruments
to manage its foreign currency and commodity exposures, which primarily relate
to forecasted transactions and interest rate exposures. Derivative financial
instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposures to market
risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices
and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party
to leveraged derivatives. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception
and throughout the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature and
relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge
transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for
hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected
terms of a forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must
be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. Financial instruments
qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness
between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and
throughout the hedged period. The Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.

Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are
effective as hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Accordingly, the Company decreased accumulated other
comprehensive losses by $23 million during the first quarter of 2002. This
reflects an increase in the fair value of derivatives of $12 million and the
transfer of deferred losses to earnings of $11 million. The fair value of all
derivative financial instruments has been calculated based on active market
quotes.

Foreign exchange rates. The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and
foreign currency options to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates from third-party and intercompany forecasted transactions. At
March 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the Company had option and forward foreign
exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $363 million and $431
million, respectively, for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies.

Commodities. The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted
purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Company's
businesses. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward contracts, as cash
flow hedges, primarily for coffee, cocoa, milk, cheese and wheat. Commodity
futures and options are also used to hedge the price of certain commodities,
including milk, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn, sugar and soybean oil. At March 31,
2002 and December 31, 2001, the Company had net long commodity positions of $603
million and $589 million, respectively.

Interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of
an insignificant portion of its long-term debt. The differential to be paid or
received is accrued and recognized as interest expense. If an interest rate swap
agreement is terminated prior to maturity, the realized gain or loss is
recognized over the remaining life of the agreement if the hedged amount remains
outstanding, or immediately if the underlying hedged exposure does not remain
outstanding. If the underlying exposure is terminated prior to the maturity of
the interest rate swap, the unrealized gain or loss on the related interest rate
swap is recognized in earnings currently. At March 31, 2002, the aggregate
notional principal amount of those agreements, which converted fixed-rate debt
to variable-rate debt, was $102 million. Aggregate maturities at March 31, 2002
were $29 million in 2003 and $73 million in 2004. During the quarter ended
March 31, 2002, there was no ineffectiveness relating to these fair value
hedges.

                               -------------------

Use of the above-mentioned derivative financial instruments has not had a
material impact on the Company's financial position at March 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, or the Company's results of operations for the three months
ended March 31, 2002 or the year ended December 31, 2001.

of contingencies.

New Accounting Standards
- ------------------------

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets." As a result, the Company stopped recording the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as a charge to
earnings during the first quarter of 2002. The Company estimates that net
earnings and diluted earnings per share would have been approximately $564
million and $0.39, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2001 had
the provisions of the new standards been applied as of January 1, 2001. In
addition, the Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and
intangible assets for potential impairment. At adoption, the Company did not
have to record a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or other
intangible assets as a result of these new standards.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company also adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which replaces SFAS No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 144 provides updated guidance concerning the
recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of
long-lived assets, expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a
component of an entity and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation
when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. The adoption of this
new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2002.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF") No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF Issue No.
00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a
Reseller of the Vendor's Products." The adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and
No. 00-25 resulted in a reduction of revenues of approximately $1.2 billion in
the first quarter of 2001. In addition, the adoption reduced marketing,
administration and research costs in the first quarter of 2001 by approximately
$1.2 billion, while cost of sales increased by an insignificant amount. The
adoption of these EITF Issues had no impact on net earnings or basic and diluted
EPS.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
- -----------------------------------------

The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral
forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in its reports to
shareholders. One can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words
such as "strategy," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will,"
"continues," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other
words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In connection with the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the
Company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results
and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statement made by or on behalf of the Company; any such statement is qualified
by reference to the following cautionary statements.

Each of the Company's segments is subject to intense competition, changes in
consumer preferences, the effects of changing prices for its raw materials and
local economic conditions. Their results are dependent upon their continued
ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new
consumer trends, to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand
portfolios in order to compete effectively with lower priced products in a
consolidating environment at the retail and manufacturing levels, and to improve
productivity. The Company's results are also dependent on its ability to
successfully integrate and derive cost savings from the integration of Nabisco's
operations with the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to the effects
of foreign economies, currency movements and fluctuations in levels of customer
inventories. The food industry continues to be subject to recalls if products
become adulterated or misbranded, liability if product consumption causes
injury, ingredient disclosure and labeling laws and regulations and the
possibility that consumers could lose confidence in the safety and quality of
certain food products. Developments in any of these areas, which are more fully
described above and which descriptions are incorporated into this section by
reference, could cause the Company's results to differ materially from results
that have been or may be projected by or on behalf of the Company. The Company
cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. The
Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be
made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.

                           Part II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings.

          Legal Proceedings
          -----------------

          The Company's subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal
          proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including
          the matters discussed below. While the results of litigation cannot be
          predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome
          of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the
          Company's results of operations or financial position.

          On May 8, 2002, an organization called American Environmental Safety
          Institute announced the filing of a lawsuit against "major
          chocolate manufacturers," citing "potentially dangerous levels of lead
          and cadmium in chocolate products." The suit alleges a violation of
          California's Proposition 65, which requires a warning on products
          containing chemicals that are "known to the State" to be carcinogens
          or reproductive toxicants. The targets of the suit are various
          manufacturers of chocolate products, including the Company. Officials
          with the California Attorney General's Office and the Food and Drug
          Administration have supported the industry's position, and the
          California Attorney General has publicly stated that the case is
          without merit.

          National Cheese Exchange Cases: Since 1996, seven putative class
          actions have been filed by various dairy farmers alleging that the
          Company and others engaged in a conspiracy to fix and depress the
          prices of bulk cheese and milk through their trading activity on the
          National Cheese Exchange. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and equitable
          relief and unspecified treble damages. Two of the actions were
          voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs after class certification was
          denied. Three cases were consolidated in state court in Wisconsin, and
          in November 1999, the court granted the Company's motion for summary
          judgment. In June 2001, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the
          trial court's ruling dismissing the cases. In April 2002, the
          Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's
          ruling. The Company's motion to dismiss was granted in a case pending
          in the United States District Court for the Central District of
          California. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
          reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. Following the
          remand, in April 2002, the district court granted a motion for summary
          judgment dismissing the case. A case in Illinois state court has been
          settled and dismissed. No classes have been certified in any of the
          cases.

          Environmental Matters
          ---------------------

          In May 2001, the State of Ohio notified the Company that it may be
          subject to an enforcement action for alleged past violations of the
          Company's wastewater discharge permit at its production facility in
          Farmdale, Ohio. The State has offered to attempt to negotiate a
          settlement of this matter, and the Company has accepted the offer to
          do so. The State has not yet identified the relief it may seek in this
          matter.

          The Company is potentially liable for certain environmental matters
          arising from the operations of Nabisco's former wholly-owned
          subsidiary, Rowe Industries. Rowe operated a small engine
          manufacturing facility in Sag Harbor, New York in the 1950s, 1960s and
          early 1970s that used various solvents. About 20 homes downgradient
          from the site were connected to public drinking water in the mid-1980s
          after solvents were detected in their individual wells. Since 1996,
          three toxic tort cases have been brought against Nabisco in New York
          state court, collectively by or on behalf of approximately 80
          individuals, including 17 minors. The first case was filed on March 6,
          1996, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and was
          subsequently dismissed by the trial court. That decision was affirmed
          on appeal. The other two cases both were filed on January 3, 2000,
          also in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. That court granted
          defendant's summary judgment motion as to all but one of the
          plaintiffs in each of the remaining cases, and the plaintiffs have now
          withdrawn their appeal of this ruling. The Company recently filed
          summary judgment motions as to the remaining two plaintiffs, who are
          seeking unspecified damages for alleged personal injury and fear or
          risk of cancer.

          Twelve lawsuits recently were filed against Del Monte Corporation
          (which previously was affiliated with Nabisco or a former affiliate)
          and six other pesticide users and manufacturers for alleged injuries
          to workers caused by exposure to dibromochloropropane ("DBCP"). The
          complaints were served on Del Monte Corporation on approximately
          February 21, 2002. The complaints allege that Del Monte Corporation
          purchased DBCP in mid-1979 with the objective of using it in
          Nicaragua. The lawsuits, which were instituted between September 17,
          2001 and October 1, 2001 with the Third Civil District Judge for
          Managua (Nicaragua), collectively seek unspecified costs and expenses
          and compensatory and punitive damages of approximately $720 million.
          In March 2002, a third party agreed to defend and indemnify the
          Company for each of these claims.
