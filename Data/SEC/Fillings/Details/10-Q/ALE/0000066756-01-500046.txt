                           SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER
              THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  we are  hereby  filing  cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause our actual  results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this  quarterly  report on Form 10-Q, in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"  "predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue" or
similar  expressions)  are  not  statements  of  historical  facts  and  may  be
forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond our  control and may cause  actual  results to differ
materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

    -    prevailing  governmental  policies  and  regulatory  actions, including
         those of the United States Congress, state legislatures,  the FERC, the
         MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the PSCW and various county regulators, about
         allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and
         disposal of assets and facilities,  operation and construction of plant
         facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital  investments,  and
         present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including but
         not limited to transmission costs);
    -    economic and geographic factors, including political and economic
         risks;
    -    changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
         policies;
    -    weather conditions;
    -    population growth rates and demographic patterns;
    -    competition for retail and wholesale customers;
    -    pricing and transportation of commodities;
    -    market demand, including structural market changes;
    -    changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
    -    changes in project costs;
    -    unanticipated changes in  operating  expenses and capital expenditures;
    -    capital market conditions;
    -    competition for new energy and other development opportunities; and
    -    legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or criminal)
         and settlements that affect the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking  statement
to reflect  events or  circumstances  after the date on which that  statement is
made or to reflect the occurrence of  unanticipated  events.  New factors emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for  management to predict all of those
factors, nor can it assess the impact of each of those factors on the businesses
of ALLETE or the extent to which any factor,  or  combination  of  factors,  may
cause  actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  contained  in  any
forward-looking statement.

NOTE 2.    ACQUISITIONS

ADESA AUCTION FACILITIES. On January 18, 2001 we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of ComSearch in exchange for ALLETE common stock and paid cash to purchase
all of the  assets  of APC in  transactions  with an  aggregate  value  of $62.4
million.  APC was accounted for using the purchase method. APC financial results
have been included in our  consolidated  financial  statements since the date of
purchase.  ComSearch was accounted for as a pooling of interests  with financial
results included in our consolidated financial statements since January 1, 2001.
Pro forma financial results have not been presented due to immateriality. APC is
a provider of "total loss" vehicle recovery services with ten auction facilities
in the United  States.  ComSearch  provides  Internet-based  parts  location and
insurance adjustment audit services nationwide.

On May 1, 2001 ADESA  purchased  the  assets of the I-44 Auto  Auction in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Financial
results have been included in our  consolidated  financial  statements since the
date of purchase.  Pro forma  financial  results have not been  presented due to
immateriality.  The I-44 Auto Auction, which is located on 75 acres, was renamed
ADESA Tulsa and offers six auction lanes,  storage for over 3,000 vehicles and a
five-bay reconditioning and detail facility.

DICKS CREEK. In February 2001 ALLETE Water Services  completed the December 2000
purchase  of the  assets of Dicks  Creek,  a  wastewater  utility  located  near
Atlanta, Georgia, for $6.6 million plus a commitment to pay the seller a fee for
residential  connections.  The  commitment  requires the payment of a minimum of
$400,000 annually beginning December 31, 2001 for four years or until cumulative
payments reach $2 million, whichever occurs first. The transaction was accounted
for using the  purchase  method.  Financial  results  have been  included in our
consolidated  financial  statements  since February  2001.  Pro forma  financial
results have not been presented due to immateriality.



NOTE 3.    INVESTMENT IN ACE

In May 2000 we recorded a $30.4 million,  or $0.44 per share,  after-tax gain on
the sale of the 4.7 million shares of ACE that we received in December 1999 when
Capital  Re merged  with  ACE.  At the time of the  merger we owned 7.3  million
shares, or 20 percent, of Capital Re.



NOTE 4.    LONG-TERM DEBT

On February  21, 2001 ALLETE  issued $125  million of 7.80%  Senior  Notes,  due
February 15, 2008.  Proceeds were used to repay a portion of ALLETE's short-term
borrowings incurred for the acquisition of vehicle auction facilities  purchased
in 2000 and early 2001, and for general corporate purposes.



NOTE 5.    COMMON STOCK

During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, we issued and sold 6.6 million shares of
common  stock at  $23.68  per  share in an  underwritten  public  offering.  Net
proceeds  of $150  million  were  used  to  repay a  portion  of our  short-term
borrowings with the remainder invested in short-term instruments.



NOTE 6.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the quarter ended June 30, 2001 total comprehensive income was $52.8 million
($42.7  million for the quarter ended June 30,  2000).  For the six months ended
June 30, 2001 total  comprehensive  income was $79.2 million  ($91.7 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2000).  Total  comprehensive  income  includes net
income,    unrealized   gains   and   losses   on   securities   classified   as
available-for-sale,  changes  in the fair  value of an  interest  rate  swap and
foreign currency translation adjustments.

NOTE 9.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD

In July 2001 the FASB issued SFAS 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets."
SFAS 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an  amortization  method to an
impairment-only approach.  Amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded
in past  business  combinations,  will cease for fiscal  years  beginning  after
December  15,  2001.  We have $537  million of  goodwill as of June 30, 2001 and
after-tax  goodwill  amortization  expense of approximately $5.5 million for the
first six months of 2001.  Annual  after-tax  goodwill  amortization  expense is
expected to be approximately  $11 million in 2001. We do not believe we have any
goodwill impairment at this time.

NOTE 10.     SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

Minnesota Power, our electric utility business,  has a power purchase  agreement
with Square Butte that extends through 2026 (Agreement). It provides a long-term
supply of low-cost  energy to customers in our electric  service  territory  and
enables Minnesota Power to meet power pool reserve requirements. Square Butte, a
North Dakota cooperative corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating
unit (Unit) near Center, North Dakota. The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit
owned by Minnkota Power Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative
corporation  whose Class A members are also  members of Square  Butte.  Minnkota
serves as the operator of the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's  output
under the  Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance
notice  requirement,  Minnkota  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  Minnesota Power
is  obligated  to pay its pro  rata  share  of  Square  Butte's  costs  based on
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to  Unit  output.   Minnesota  Power's  payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service.  At June 30, 2001 Square Butte had total debt
outstanding  of $314.9  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of the years 2001 through 2003
and $23  million in both 2004 and 2005.  Variable  operating  costs  include the
price of coal purchased from BNI Coal,  Ltd., our subsidiary,  under a long-term
contract.  Minnesota  Power's payments to Square Butte are approved as purchased
power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ALLETE is a  multi-services  company with operations in four business  segments:
(1) ENERGY SERVICES,  which include  electric and gas services,  coal mining and
telecommunications;  (2) AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES, which include a network of vehicle
auctions,  an automobile dealer finance company,  and several  subsidiaries that
are integral parts of the vehicle  redistribution  business; (3) WATER SERVICES,
which include water and wastewater services; and (4) INVESTMENTS,  which include
real estate  operations,  investments  in emerging  technologies  related to the
electric  utility  industry  and  a  securities  portfolio.   Corporate  charges
represent  general  corporate  expenses,  including  interest,  not specifically
related to any one business segment.


CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW

Each of our operating segments produced solid financial results during the first
six months of 2001,  reflecting  the  success of  ALLETE's  growth  initiatives.
Excluding the ACE transaction (see net income discussion  below), net income and
earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2001  increased 26 percent and
19 percent, respectively, over the same period in 2000. For the six months ended
June 30, 2001,  excluding the ACE transaction,  net income was up 17 percent and
earnings per share were up 13 percent over the same period in 2000.

NET INCOME

The following net income discussion  summarizes  significant  events for the six
months ended June 30, 2001.

ENERGY  SERVICES'  net  income  in  2001  reflected  more  profitable  wholesale
marketing and trading activities because of overall market conditions, decreased
sales to industrial  customers and  additional  costs  incurred as a result of a
severe ice storm.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES reported a 42 percent increase in net income in 2001 due to
significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001 and  increased  financing
activity at AFC's loan  production  offices.  EBITDAL for ADESA's 28  same-store
auction  facilities  was up 7 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2001 (13
percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2001).  Increased costs and reduced sales
volumes because of inclement weather in early 2001 hampered  financial  results.
Costs of assimilating  the 28 vehicle auction  facilities  acquired or opened in
2000 also impacted 2001 results.

WATER  SERVICES'  net income was  slightly  higher in 2001  reflecting  customer
growth,  an October  2000 rate  increase  implemented  by Heater,  cost  control
efforts and the release of escrow  proceeds  received from the sale of assets to
Orange  County,  Florida in 1997.  Above-average  rainfall in Florida during the
second quarter and conservation efforts negatively impacted net income in 2001.

INVESTMENTS  reported higher net income in 2001 primarily due to increased sales
by our real estate  operations.  In June 2001 our real estate  operations closed
its largest sale ever.  The  after-tax  return on our  securities  portfolio was
10.02  percent in 2001 (6.02 percent in 2000),  however,  we had a lower average
balance in 2001. During 2000 we reduced the size of our securities  portfolio to
partially fund significant acquisitions made by Automotive Services.

CORPORATE CHARGES reflected increased interest expense and additional  incentive
compensation accruals.

ACE  TRANSACTION.  In May 2000 we recorded a $30.4 million,  or $0.44 per share,
after-tax  gain on the sale of the 4.7 million shares of ACE that we received in
December 1999 when Capital Re merged with ACE.


COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 AND 2000

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating revenue was up $9.0 million,  or 6 percent, in 2001,
due to  additional  demand  revenue from large power  customers  who converted a
portion of their  interruptible  power to firm power, fuel clause recoveries for
higher purchased power and gas prices, and wholesale power marketing and trading
activities  by  Split  Rock  and  Minnesota  Power.   Minnesota  Power's  retail
megawatthour  sales  were down 3 percent  because  of  temporary  shutdowns  and
reduced   production  by  taconite   customers.   Minnesota   Power's  wholesale
megawatthour  sales  were  lower  because  sales are now made by Split  Rock and
recorded in its  financial  statements.  Split  Rock,  a joint  venture  between
Minnesota Power and Great River Energy,  combines power supply  capabilities and
customer  loads to share market and supply risks and to optimize  power  trading
opportunities. Our equity income from Split Rock was $2.9 million more in 2001.

Revenue from  electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 9 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in 2001 (13 percent in 2000). Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 2001 (5 percent in 2000).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 4
percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2001 (6 percent in 2000).

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES'  operating revenue was up $91.1 million, or 70 percent, in
2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001. At
ADESA auction  facilities  492,000 vehicles were sold in 2001 (307,000 in 2000),
an increase of 60 percent.  Financial  results for 2001 included three months of
operations from 28 auction facilities acquired or opened primarily in the second
half of 2000  and  results  from  acquisitions  made in  January  and May  2001.
Operating  revenue from AFC was higher in

13                     ALLETE Second Quarter 2001 Form 10-Q



<PAGE>

2001 reflecting a 15 percent increase in vehicles financed through existing loan
production offices. AFC financed approximately 232,000 vehicles in 2001 (202,000
in 2000).  AFC had 87 loan  production  offices at June 30, 2001 (86 at June 30,
2000).

WATER SERVICES'  operating revenue was down $0.3 million,  or 1 percent, in 2001
due  to  a  9  percent  decrease  in  consumption   primarily   attributable  to
above-average  rainfall in Florida and  conservation  efforts.  The decrease was
tempered by  additional  revenue from a 7 percent  increase in customers  and an
October 2000 rate increase implemented by Heater.

INVESTMENTS'  operating  revenue was up $16.2  million,  or 61 percent,  in 2001
primarily due to stronger sales by our real estate operations. In 2001 two large
real estate  sales  contributed  $30.4  million to  revenue,  one which was real
estate  operations'  largest single transaction to date. In 2000 four large real
estate sales contributed  $13.1 million to revenue.  Revenue from our securities
portfolio was down slightly in 2001 due to a lower average balance.

OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $8.6 million, or 7 percent, in 2001
because of higher prices paid for purchased  power and purchased gas.  Operating
expenses  also  increased in 2001 due to higher plant  maintenance  expenses and
additional costs incurred as a result of a severe ice storm.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES' operating expenses were up $82.9 million, or 79 percent, in
2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001. In
addition to the  increased  costs  associated  with having more vehicle  auction
facilities in operation, expenses in 2001 included integration costs, additional
amortization of goodwill and higher  interest  expense related to debt issued in
late 2000 to finance these acquisitions.

WATER SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $0.3 million,  or 1 percent, in 2001
due to  customer  growth  and the  inclusion  of water  and  wastewater  systems
acquired in 2000.

INVESTMENTS'  operating expenses were up $4.2 million, or 42 percent, in 2001 as
a result of higher sales by our real estate operations.


COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 AND 2000

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating revenue was up $26.8 million, or 10 percent, in 2001
due to  additional  demand  revenue from large power  customers  who converted a
portion of their  interruptible  power to firm power, fuel clause recoveries for
higher purchased power and gas prices, and wholesale power marketing and trading
activities.  Minnesota  Power's  retail  megawatthour  sales were down 5 percent
because of temporary  shutdowns and reduced  production  by taconite  customers.
Minnesota Power's wholesale  megawatthour sales were lower because sales are now
made by Split Rock and recorded in its financial  statements.  Our equity income
from Split Rock was $3.1 million more in 2001.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 9  percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2001 (13 percent in 2000).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 2001 (5 percent in 2000).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 5
percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2001 (6 percent in 2000).

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES' operating revenue was up $182.7 million, or 73 percent, in
2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001. At
ADESA auction  facilities  993,000 vehicles were sold in 2001 (602,000 in 2000),
an increase of 65 percent.  Financial  results for 2001  included  six months of
operations from 28 auction facilities acquired or opened primarily in the second
half of 2000 and results from  acquisitions  made in January and May 2001. Sales
volumes in 2001 were  hampered by inclement  weather  that  resulted in both low
attendance at and canceled auctions earlier in the year.  Operating revenue from
AFC was higher in 2001  reflecting  a 14 percent  increase in vehicles  financed
through

                      ALLETE Second Quarter 2001 Form 10-Q                    14

existing loan production offices. AFC financed approximately 453,000 vehicles in
2001 (397,000 in 2000). AFC had 87 loan production offices in 2001 (86 in 2000).

WATER SERVICES' operating revenue was up $1.2 million, or 2 percent, in 2001 due
to customer  growth of 7 percent,  an October 2000 rate increase  implemented by
Heater and the release of escrow proceeds  received from the 1997 sale of assets
to Orange County,  Florida.  Above-average  rainfall in Florida and conservation
efforts negatively impacted revenue in 2001.

INVESTMENTS'  operating  revenue was down $4.3  million,  or 7 percent,  in 2001
primarily  due to  $4.0  million  less  revenue  from  our  emerging  technology
investments  as a result of fewer sales of these  investments  in 2001.  Revenue
from our securities  portfolio was down in 2001 due to a lower average  balance.
Our real estate  operations  reported  stronger  sales at all locations in 2001.
Four large real estate sales in 2001  contributed  $33.1  million to revenue and
included our largest single real estate transaction to date. In 2000 seven large
real estate sales contributed $31.9 million to revenue.

OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $24 million, or 10 percent, in 2001
because of higher prices paid for purchased  power and purchased gas.  Operating
expenses  also  increased in 2001 due to higher plant  maintenance  expenses and
additional costs incurred as a result of a severe ice storm.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $164.9 million, or 81 percent,
in 2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001.
In addition to the increased  costs  associated with having more vehicle auction
facilities in operation, expenses in 2001 included integration costs, additional
amortization of goodwill and higher  interest  expense related to debt issued in
late 2000 to finance  acquisitions.  Operating  expenses in 2001 also  reflected
additional  expenses  for  utility  and  labor  costs  incurred  as a result  of
inclement  weather  conditions  compared to 2000 when  weather  conditions  were
relatively mild.

WATER SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $0.7 million,  or 1 percent, in 2001
due to  customer  growth  and the  inclusion  of water  and  wastewater  systems
acquired in 2000.

INVESTMENTS'  operating expenses were down $6.5 million,  or 26 percent, in 2001
due to reduced expenses associated with sales by our real estate operations.


OUTLOOK

The solid  performance from each of our four business  segments during the first
six months of 2001 reflected the success of ALLETE's growth initiatives.

ENERGY SERVICES. The economic health of the taconite industry is important to us
and the impact of cheap  foreign  steel  imports  concerns  us.  While  taconite
production  is  currently  expected  to  continue  at annual  levels of about 40
million tons, the longer-term outlook of this cyclical industry is less certain.
In May 2001 we  submitted  a bid to acquire LTV Steel  Mining  Co.'s (LTV) three
75-megawatt  electric generating units located in northern  Minnesota.  This bid
was submitted in connection with a bid by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. to acquire LTV's
Minnesota  mining assets.  We believe our offer is competitive,  but LTV has not
yet responded to our proposal. Our recent acquisition of Enventis,  Inc., a data
network  systems  provider  headquartered  in  the  Minneapolis-St.  Paul  area,
complements  our existing  infrastructure  and fiber optics network in Minnesota
and Wisconsin.  While  relatively  small,  this  transaction  helps position our
telecommunications  business  as one  of the  leading  integrated  data  service
providers in the Upper  Midwest.  Overall,  we believe  Energy  Services is well
positioned for future growth opportunities.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES  acquisitions made during 2000 and early 2001, and continued
growth of AFC's  vehicle  finance  business,  contributed  significantly  to net
income for the first six months of 2001.  With the  planned  addition  of "total
loss" vehicle recovery services at existing ADESA vehicle auction facilities and
economies of scale as a result of  integration  efficiencies  at newly  acquired
vehicle auction facilities, we continue to expect that Automotive Services' 2001
net  income  contribution  will be at least 40 percent  over

15                    ALLETE Second Quarter 2001 Form 10-Q

<PAGE>

last year. We also expect that EBITDAL from same-store ADESA auction  facilities
will increase 10 percent to 15 percent.

In 2001  industry-wide,  dealer  consignment sales have been down due to pricing
pressure in the used vehicle market. The pricing pressure is partially caused by
aggressive  incentives  currently  offered  by  vehicle   manufacturers.   These
incentives  reduce the value of used  vehicles.  We  continue  to  believe  that
vehicle sales within the auto auction industry are expected to rise at a rate of
2 percent to 4 percent annually over the next several years.

WATER SERVICES. Even though Florida had above-average rainfall during the second
quarter of 2001 and water use  restrictions  remain in effect,  Water  Services'
2001 financial  results are still on target due to customer  growth at water and
wastewater systems in both Florida and North Carolina.

INVESTMENTS.  The $29 million sale of the Tarpon  Point  property in Cape Coral,
Florida in June 2001 was our real estate operations'  largest single transaction
to date. The real estate strategy continues to be to acquire large properties at
low  cost,  add  value  and  sell  them  at  current   market  prices.   Through
subsidiaries, we own Florida real estate operations in four different locations:

     -   LEHIGH ACRES with 1,100 acres of land and  approximately 500 home sites
         adjacent to Fort Myers, Florida;
     -   SUGARMILL WOODS with 475 home sites in Citrus County, Florida;
     -   PALM COAST with 1,630  home  sites  and  9,300  acres  of  residential,
         commercial and industrial land  at Palm Coast, Florida. Palm Coast is a
         planned community between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach; and
     -   CAPE CORAL, located adjacent to Fort Myers, Florida, with approximately
         600  acres of  commercial  and  residential zoned  land, including home
         sites and commercial buildings.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH  FLOW  ACTIVITIES.  During  the  first  six  months  of 2001 cash flow from
operations  reflected  strong  operating  results and continued focus on working
capital  management.  The  decrease  in cash  flow from  operations  in 2001 was
primarily  attributable  to changes in trading  securities.  In 2001  additional
trading securities were purchased with a portion of the proceeds from our recent
common stock issuance (see Securities  below),  while in 2000 trading securities
were sold to partially fund the acquisition of Auction Finance Group,  Inc. Cash
flow from operations was also affected by a number of factors  representative of
normal operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper.  Our  securities  investments  can be
liquidated  to  provide  funds  for  reinvestment  in  existing   businesses  or
acquisition of new businesses.  Approximately 6 million original issue shares of
our common stock are available for issuance  through Invest  Direct,  our direct
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided.  However, ADESA has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC also has  arrangements  to use proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper
issued by ALLETE to meet its  operational  requirements.  AFC offers  short-term
on-site financing for dealers to purchase vehicles at auctions in exchange for a
security  interest in those  vehicles.  The  financing  is provided  through the
earlier of the date the dealer sells the vehicle or a general  borrowing term of
30 to 45 days.

AFC sells certain  finance  receivables on a revolving  basis to a wholly owned,
unconsolidated,  qualified special purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn
sells,  on  a  revolving  basis,  an  undivided  interest  in  eligible  finance
receivables,  up to a maximum at any one time  outstanding  of $300 million,  to
third party  purchasers  under an agreement  that expires at the end of 2002. At
June 30, 2001 AFC had sold


                      ALLETE Second Quarter 2001 Form 10-Q                    16



<PAGE>

$421.5 million of finance  receivables to the special purpose subsidiary ($335.7
million at December 31,2000).  Third party purchasers had purchased an undivided
interest in finance  receivables of $281.0 million from this  subsidiary at June
30, 2001 ($239 million at December 31, 2000).  Unsold  finance  receivables  and
unfinanced  receivables  held by the special purpose  subsidiary are recorded by
AFC as residual  interest at fair value.  Fair value is based upon  estimates of
future cash flows, using assumptions that market participants would use to value
such instruments, including estimates of anticipated credit losses over the life
of the  receivables  sold  without  application  of a  discount  rate due to the
short-term  nature of the  receivables  sold.  The fair value of AFC's  residual
interest  was $137.2  million at June 30, 2001  ($106.2  million at December 31,
2000).  Proceeds from the sale of the receivables  were used to repay borrowings
from ALLETE and fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at June
30, 2001 compared to December 31, 2000 were due to increased sales and financing
activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down during the
winter months and in December because of the holidays.  As a result,  both ADESA
and AFC had higher receivables and higher payables at June 30, 2001.

ACQUISITIONS.  In  January  2001 we  acquired  all of the  outstanding  stock of
ComSearch in exchange  for ALLETE  common stock and paid cash to purchase all of
the assets of APC in transactions with an aggregate value of $62.4 million.  APC
was  funded  with  internally  generated  funds and  short-term  debt  which was
refinanced with long-term  debt.  (See  Securities  below.) APC is a provider of
"total loss" vehicle recovery services with ten auction facilities in the United
States.   ComSearch  provides   Internet-based   parts  location  and  insurance
adjustment audit services nationwide.  Both APC and ComSearch are based in Rhode
Island.

In February 2001 ALLETE Water  Services  completed the purchase of the assets of
Dicks  Creek,  a wastewater  utility  located near  Atlanta,  Georgia,  for $6.6
million  plus a  commitment  to pay  the  seller  a fee for  future  residential
connections.  The commitment  requires payment of a minimum of $400,000 annually
beginning December 31, 2001 for four years or until cumulative payments reach $2
million,  whichever  occurs first.  The  transaction  was funded with internally
generated funds.

In May 2001  ADESA  purchased  the  assets  of the I-44 Auto  Auction  in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The I-44 Auto Auction, which is located on 75 acres, was renamed ADESA
Tulsa and offers six  auction  lanes,  storage  for over  3,000  vehicles  and a
five-bay  reconditioning  and detail  facility.  The transaction was funded with
internally generated funds.

In July  2001 we  acquired  Enventis,  Inc.,  a data  network  systems  provider
headquartered  in  the  Minneapolis-St.  Paul  area.  In  connection  with  this
acquisition,  we issued  310,878  shares of our common stock.  This  transaction
complements  our existing  infrastructure  and fiber optics network in Minnesota
and Wisconsin, and helps position our telecommunications  business as one of the
leading integrated data service providers in the Upper Midwest.

SECURITIES.  In February 2001 we issued $125 million of 7.80% Senior Notes,  due
February 15, 2008.  Proceeds were used to repay a portion of ALLETE's short-term
bank borrowings  incurred for the  acquisition of vehicle auction  facilities in
2000 and early 2001 and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2001 ALLETE,  ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III, jointly filed a
registration  statement  with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under the  Securities
Act of 1933. The registration  statement,  which has been declared  effective by
the SEC,  relates  to the  possible  issuance,  from  time to time  when  market
conditions  and the  needs of ALLETE  warrant,  of an  aggregate  amount of $500
million of securities  which may include  ALLETE common  stock,  first  mortgage
bonds,  and other debt  securities  and ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III
preferred  trust  securities,   of  which  approximately  $387  million  remains
available to be issued.  ALLETE also previously filed a registration  statement,
which has been declared effective by the SEC, relating to the possible issuance,
from time to time when market conditions and the needs of ALLETE warrant, of $25
million of first mortgage bonds and other debt securities.  We may sell all or a
portion of the remaining registered securities if warranted by market conditions
and  our  capital  requirements.  Any  offer  and  sale of the  above  mentioned
securities will be made only by means of a prospectus  meeting the  requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.

<PAGE>

On May 30,  2001 we  issued  and sold in an  underwritten  public  offering  6.5
million  shares  of  common  stock  at  $23.68  per  share.   In  addition,   an
over-allotment  option for 100,000  shares at $23.68 per share was  exercised by
the  underwriters  and sold on June 7, 2001.  Total net proceeds of $150 million
were used to repay a portion of our  short-term  borrowings  with the  remainder
invested in short-term instruments.  The increase in the number of shares of our
common  stock  outstanding  as of June 30,  2001  had an  immaterial  impact  on
earnings per share for the 2001 periods.

INVESTMENTS.  As companies included in our emerging  technology  investments are
sold, we may  recognize a gain or loss.  In the second half of 2000,  several of
the private  companies  included in our  emerging  technology  investments  went
public by completing initial public offerings. Typically, investors in a private
company are not  permitted to sell stock in the company for a period of 180 days
following the company's initial public offering.  Other restrictions on sale may
also apply and certain shares are held  indirectly by us through our investments
in independent  investment funds.  Since going public, the market value of these
companies  has  experienced  significant  volatility.   Our  investment  in  the
companies that have gone public has a cost basis of  approximately  $12 million.
The aggregate market value of our investment in these companies at June 30, 2001
was $38 million.

Our  emerging  technology  investments  provide  us with  access  to  developing
technologies  before their  commercial  debut,  as well as  potential  financial
returns and diversification opportunities. We view these investments as a source
of capital for  redeployment in existing  businesses and a potential entree into
additional  business  opportunities.  Portions of any proceeds received on these
investments  may be reinvested  back into companies to encourage  development of
future technology.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. Consolidated capital expenditures for the six months ended
June 30, 2001 totaled $78.3 million  ($56.5 million in 2000).  Expenditures  for
2001 included  $29.3 million for Energy  Services,  $33.9 million for Automotive
Services and $15.1 million for Water  Services.  Internally  generated funds and
the  issuance of  long-term  debt were the primary  sources of funding for these
expenditures.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In July  2001  the FASB  issued  SFAS  141,  142 and 143.  SFAS  141,  "Business
Combinations"  requires  that the purchase  method of accounting be used for all
business  combinations  initiated  after June 30,  2001.  Use of the  pooling of
interests  method of accounting  will be prohibited.  We do not have any pending
acquisitions that will be impacted by this new rule.

SFAS 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets"  changes the  accounting for
goodwill  from  an   amortization   method  to  an   impairment-only   approach.
Amortization  of  goodwill,   including   goodwill  recorded  in  past  business
combinations,  will cease for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We
have  $537  million  of  goodwill  as of June 30,  2001 and  after-tax  goodwill
amortization  expense of approximately  $5.5 million for the first six months of
2001.  Annual  after-tax  goodwill   amortization  expense  is  expected  to  be
approximately  $11  million  in 2001.  We do not  believe  we have any  goodwill
impairment at this time.

SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" requires the recognition
of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in which it is
incurred.  When the liability is initially recorded,  the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time, the liability
is  accreted  to its  present  value  and  the  related  capitalized  charge  is
depreciated over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal
years  beginning  after June 15, 2002. We are currently  reviewing the impact of
SFAS 143 on the Company.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our  securities  portfolio  has exposure to both price and  interest  rate risk.
Investments  held  principally  for  near-term  sale are  classified  as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies.  In strategies  designed to hedge
overall market risks, we also sell common stock short.  Investments  held for an
indefinite  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale  securities and
also recorded at fair value. Available-for-sale securities consist of our direct
investments in emerging  technology  companies and securities in a grantor trust
established to fund certain employee benefits.

In June 2001 Minnesota Power  successfully  completed testing its new generating
unit at  Potlatch  Corp.'s  pulp and paper mill in Cloquet,  Minnesota.  Pending
approval of test results from MAPP, the new unit will be ready to generate up to
23 megawatts of electricity. The new cogeneration unit will burn a mixture of 50
percent wood waste and 50 percent natural gas.  Minnesota Power will own the new
turbine  generator  and have access to its excess power in times of high demand.
Potlatch will operate and maintain it at Minnesota Power's expense.
