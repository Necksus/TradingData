                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q, in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"   "projects,"   "will  likely   result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

   -  war and acts of terrorism;

   -  prevailing  governmental policies and regulatory actions, including  those
      of the United States Congress, state legislatures, the FERC, the MPUC, the
      FPSC,  the  NCUC,  the  PSCW,  and  various  county  regulators  and  city
      administrators,  about allowed rates of return,  financings,  industry and
      rate  structure,  acquisition  and  disposal  of  assets  and  facilities,
      operation  and  construction  of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased
      power and capital  investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and
      retail  competition  (including but not limited to transmission  costs) as
      well as general  vehicle-related  laws,  including  vehicle  brokerage and
      auction laws;

   -  unanticipated  impacts  of  restructuring  initiatives  in   the  electric
      industry;

   -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

   -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;

   -  weather conditions;

   -  natural disasters;

   -  market factors affecting supply and demand for used vehicles;

   -  wholesale power market conditions;

   -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;

   -  the  effects  of  competition,  including  the  competition for retail and
      wholesale  customers,  as well as  suppliers  and purchasers of vehicles;

   -  pricing and transportation of commodities;

   -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

   -  unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;

   -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

   -  capital market conditions;

   -  competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;

   -  our ability to manage expansion and integrate acquisitions; and

   -  the outcome of legal  and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or
      criminal) and settlements  that affect the business and  profitability  of
      ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

NOTE 2.    OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AFC, through a wholly owned, consolidated subsidiary, sells
certain  finance   receivables   through  a  revolving  private   securitization
structure.  The  securitization  agreement  allows for the revolving sale by the
subsidiary  to third  parties of up to $500  million in  undivided  interests in
eligible finance receivables. The securitization agreement expires in 2005.

AFC managed total receivables of $524.9 million at June 30, 2003 ($495.1 million
at December 31, 2002); $211.1 million of this amount represent receivables which
were included in accounts  receivable on our consolidated  balance sheet ($191.3
million at  December  31,  2002) and $313.8  million  of this  amount  represent
receivables sold in undivided  interests  through the  securitization  agreement
($303.8  million at  December  31,  2002)  which are  off-balance  sheet.  AFC's
proceeds  from the sale of the  receivables  to third parties were used to repay
borrowings  from  ALLETE  and fund new  loans  to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the
subsidiary  must each  maintain  certain  financial  covenants  such as  minimum
tangible net worth to comply with the terms of the securitization agreement. AFC
has historically  performed better than the covenant thresholds set forth in the
securitization   agreement.   We  are  not  currently   aware  of  any  changing
circumstances that would put AFC in noncompliance with the covenants.

ACCOUNTING  FOR  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  We  have  elected  to  account  for
stock-based  compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees."  Accordingly,  no expense is recognized for employee
stock options granted.  If we had applied the fair value recognition  provisions
of SFAS  123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  we  estimate  that
stock-based  compensation expense would have increased $0.6 million after tax in
the first six months of 2003 ($0.7  million after tax in the first six months of
2002),  and basic and diluted  earnings per share would have decreased  $0.01 (a
$0.01 per share  decrease in the first six months of 2002).  These  amounts were
calculated  using the  Black-Scholes  option pricing model. We estimate the full
year impact to be  approximately  $1.3  million,  or $0.02 per share,  for 2003.
Expense  is  recognized   for   performance   share  awards,   and  amounted  to
approximately  $1.2  million  after tax in the first  six  months of 2003  ($1.8
million in the first six months of 2002).


NOTE 3.    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

We conduct our annual goodwill  impairment testing in the second quarter of each
year and the 2003  test  resulted  in no  impairment.  No  event or  change  has
occurred that would  indicate the carrying  amount has been  impaired  since our
annual test.

NOTE 4.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In  January  2003 the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No.  46,  "Consolidation  of
Variable Interest  Entities." In general, a variable interest entity is one with
equity  investors  that do not have voting  rights or do not provide  sufficient
financial  resources  for the entity to support  its  activities.  Under the new
rules,  variable  interest  entities will be  consolidated  by the party that is
subject to the  majority of the risk of loss or entitled to the  majority of the
residual returns. The new rules are effective  immediately for variable interest
entities  created  after  January 31, 2003 and in the third  quarter of 2003 for
previously existing variable interest entities.  In June 2003 ADESA restructured
its  financial  arrangements  with  respect  to  four of its  wholesale  auction
facilities  previously  accounted  for as  operating  leases.  The  transactions
included the  assumption of $28 million of long-term  debt,  the issuance of $45
million of long-term debt and the recognition of $73 million of property,  plant
and  equipment.  Interpretation  No. 46 would have required ADESA to consolidate
the lessor under the lease arrangements in place prior to the restructuring.  We
are not a party to any variable interest entity required to be consolidated upon
the adoption of Interpretation 46.

In May 2003  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Financial
Instruments  with  Characteristics  of both Liabilities and Equity." In general,
SFAS 150  establishes  standards for  classification  and measurement of certain
financial  instruments with the  characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
Mandatorily  redeemable financial  instruments must be classified as a liability
and the related payments must be reported as interest expense. The new rules are
effective  immediately for financial instruments entered into after May 31, 2003
and in the third quarter of 2003 for previously existing financial  instruments.
Beginning  with the third quarter of 2003, we will be required to reclassify our
Mandatorily  Redeemable  Preferred Securities of ALLETE Capital I as a long-term
liability and reclassify the quarterly  distributions as interest expense.  This
will be a reclassification only and will not impact our results of operations.


NOTE 5.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2002 we began to execute plans developed in a strategic  review of all of the
Company's  businesses to unlock  shareholder value not reflected in the price of
our common  stock.  Businesses  identified  as having  more value if operated by
potential  purchasers rather than by us include our Water Services businesses in
Florida, North Carolina and Georgia and our auto transport business. We sold our
auto transport business and exited our retail stores at the end of first quarter
2002, and exited our vehicle import business in the first quarter of 2003.

The December 2002 asset purchase agreement Florida Water signed with the Florida
Water Services Authority,  a governmental authority formed under the laws of the
state of Florida,  was terminated by Florida Water in March 2003 after a Florida
court  ruling  delayed  the  sale.  As  a  result,  earnings  from  discontinued
operations for the six months ended June 30, 2003 included a $12.5 million ($7.9
million  after  tax)  expense   associated   with  selling  our  Water  Services
businesses. This is included in Other Expense in the table below.

In March 2003, through a condemnation proceeding,  Florida Water sold its Amelia
Island  water  and  wastewater  assets to Nassau  County  in  Florida  for $17.5
million. The transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of $9.8 million which was
included  in  our  first  quarter  and  six  months  ended  2003  earnings  from
discontinued operations.

In May 2003, through a condemnation proceeding, Florida Water sold its water and
wastewater  assets in Bradford  and Clay  counties in Florida to the Clay County
Utility  Authority for $4.3 million.  The  transaction  resulted in an after-tax
gain of $0.6  million  which was  included in our second  quarter and six months
ended June 30, 2003 earnings from discontinued operations.

In July 2003, through another  condemnation  proceeding,  Florida Water sold its
Martin County water and wastewater assets to Martin County for $2.4 million. The
transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of $0.5 million which will be included
in our third quarter 2003 earnings from discontinued operations.

NOTE 5.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

On July 24, 2003 Florida Water signed a purchase  agreement to sell seven of its
Florida water and  wastewater  systems to  governmental  entities in Florida for
$296 million  payable at closing.  The  transaction  is expected to result in an
after-tax gain of approximately  $55 million.  The water and wastewater  systems
included  in this  purchase  agreement  represent  approximately  two-thirds  of
Florida  Water's assets and constitute  systems serving the counties of Osceola,
Hernando,  Citrus,  Lee and Charlotte,  and the  communities of Marco Island and
Palm Coast. These systems combined serve  approximately  152,000 customers.  The
cash  proceeds  after  transaction  costs,  retirement of Florida Water debt and
payment  of income  taxes are  estimated  at $158  million,  and will be used to
retire debt at ALLETE.  The sale is expected to close by the end of 2003 pending
satisfaction  of certain  contingencies  and  regulatory  approvals  in Florida.
Florida  Water  will  continue  to seek  buyers  for  its  remaining  water  and
wastewater  facilities.  Systems for which governmental buyers are not found are
expected to be sold to a private buyer.

We are using an  investment  banking  firm to  facilitate  the sale of our Water
Services businesses in North Carolina and Georgia.  Discussions with prospective
buyers  are in  process.  We  expect  to enter  into  agreements  to sell  these
businesses in 2003.

As a result of our actions  towards  selling our Water Services  businesses,  we
believe it is appropriate  to continue to reflect our remaining  water assets as
discontinued operations as of June 30, 2003.

NOTE 6.    LONG-TERM DEBT

In June 2003 ADESA  restructured its financial  arrangements with respect to its
wholesale   auction   facilities   located   in   Tracy,   California;   Boston,
Massachusetts;  Charlotte,  North  Carolina;  and  Knoxville,  Tennessee.  These
wholesale auction facilities were previously  accounted for as operating leases.
The  transactions  included the assumption of $28 million of long-term debt, the
issuance of $45 million of long-term debt and the  recognition of $73 million of
property, plant and equipment. The $28 million of assumed long-term debt matures
April 1,  2020 and has a  variable  interest  rate  equal  to the  seven-day  AA
Financial  Commercial Paper Rate plus approximately  1.2%, while the $45 million
of long-term  debt issued to finance the  wholesale  auction  facility in Tracy,
California,  matures July 30, 2006 and has a variable  interest rate of prime or
LIBOR plus 1%. (See Note 4.)

In July 2003 ALLETE  used  internally  generated  funds to retire $25 million in
principal  amount of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds,  Series 6 1/4% due July
1, 2003.

In July 2003 ALLETE entered into a credit  agreement to borrow $250 million from
a  consortium  of  financial  institutions,  the  proceeds of which were used to
redeem $250 million of the  Company's  Floating  Rate First  Mortgage  Bonds due
October  20,  2003.  The July 2003  credit  agreement  expires in July 2004,  is
subject  to  interest  at LIBOR  plus  0.875%  and is secured by the lien of the
Company's  Mortgage  and Deed of Trust.  The credit  agreement  also has certain
mandatory  prepayment  provisions,  including a  requirement  to repay an amount
equal to 75 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of water assets.

NOTE 10.      COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES

SQUARE BUTTE POWER  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT.  Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase
agreement with Square Butte that extends through 2026 (Agreement). It provides a
long-term  supply  of  low-cost  energy to  customers  in our  electric  service
territory and enables  Minnesota Power to meet power pool reserve  requirements.
Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation,  owns a 455-MW coal-fired
generating  unit (Unit) near  Center,  North  Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a
generating unit owned by Minnkota, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation whose
Class A  members  are also  members  of  Square  Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the
operator of the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's  output
under the  Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance
notice  requirement,  Minnkota  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  Minnesota Power
is  obligated  to pay its pro  rata  share  of  Square  Butte's  costs  based on
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to  Unit  output.   Minnesota  Power's  payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service.  At June 30, 2003 Square Butte had total debt
outstanding  of $282.2  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be  approximately  $23.6  million in each of the years 2003  through
2007.  Variable  operating  costs include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI
Coal,  Ltd.,  our  subsidiary,  under a long-term  contract.  Minnesota  Power's
payments to Square Butte are approved as purchased  power expense for ratemaking
purposes by both the MPUC and the FERC.

LEASING  AGREEMENTS.  In June 2003 ADESA restructured its financial  arrangement
with respect to its wholesale auction facilities  located in Tracy,  California;
Boston,  Massachusetts;  Charlotte,  North Carolina;  and Knoxville,  Tennessee.
These wholesale  auction  facilities were previously  accounted for as operating
leases.  The  transactions  included the  assumption of $28 million of long-term
debt, the issuance of $45 million of long-term  debt and the  recognition of $73
million of property, plant and equipment. (See Note 4.)

We lease other  properties and equipment under  operating lease  agreements with
terms  expiring  through  2010.  The  aggregate  amount of future  minimum lease
payments for all operating  leases during 2003 is $7.8 million ($10.6 million in
2004;  $7.3  million in 2005;  $5.7 million in 2006;  $5.2 million in 2007;  and
$55.5 million thereafter).

SPLIT ROCK ENERGY. We provide up to $50.0 million of credit support, in the form
of letters of credit and financial guarantees, to facilitate the power marketing
activities  of Split Rock  Energy.  At June 30,  2003 this credit support backed
$1.7 million of Split Rock Energy's liabilities ($7.3  million  at  December 31,
2002).  The  credit support  generally expires  within one year from the date of
issuance.

KENDALL  COUNTY  POWER  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT.  We  have  275  MW of  nonregulated
generation (non rate-base generation sold at market-based rates to the wholesale
market)  through an  agreement  with NRG Energy that extends  through  September
2017.  Under the agreement we pay a fixed capacity charge for the right, but not
the  obligation,  to capacity  and energy from a 275 MW  generating  unit at NRG
Energy's  Kendall  County  facility  near  Chicago,  Illinois.  The annual fixed
capacity  charge is $21.8 million.  We are responsible for arranging the natural
gas fuel  supply.  Our strategy is to enter into  long-term  contracts to sell a
significant  portion of the 275 MW from the Kendall  County  facility,  with the
balance  to be  sold  in the  spot  market  through  short-term  agreements.  We
currently have long-term  forward capacity and energy sales contracts for 100 MW
of Kendall County generation,  with 50 MW expiring in April 2012 and the balance
in September 2017. In the first quarter of 2003 we entered into an additional 30
MW long-term  forward  capacity and energy sale contract that begins  January 1,
2004 and expires in September 2017. Neither the Kendall County agreement nor the
related  sales  contracts  are  derivatives  under  SFAS  133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY  INVESTMENTS.  We have investments in emerging  technologies
through  minority  investments  in  venture  capital  funds  and  privately-held
start-up  companies.  These  investments are accounted for using the cost method
and  included  in  Investments  on our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The total
carrying  value of these  investments  was $39.7 million at June 30, 2003 ($38.7
million at December 31, 2002). We have committed to make additional  investments
in certain emerging  technology  holdings.  The total future commitment was $5.9
million at June 30, 2003 ($7.7  million at December 31, 2002) and is expected to
be invested at various times through 2007.

NOTE 10.      COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS.  Our  businesses  are subject to  regulation  by various
federal, state and local authorities concerning environmental matters. We do not
currently anticipate that potential  expenditures for environmental matters will
be  material;  however,  we are  unable to  predict  the  outcome  of the issues
discussed below.

In May 2001 SWL&P  received  notice from the WDNR that the City of Superior  had
found soil contamination on property  adjoining a former  Manufactured Gas Plant
(MGP) site owned and  operated by SWL&P's  predecessors  from 1889 to 1904.  The
WDNR requested an environmental investigation be initiated. The WDNR also issued
SWL&P a Responsible  Party letter in February  2002 to initiate  tracking of the
project  in  the  WDNR  database  so  that   progress  can  be  monitored.   The
environmental  investigation  is  underway.  The  Phase  II  environmental  site
investigation  report was  submitted to the WDNR in February  2003.  This report
identified  some MGP-like  chemicals  that were found in the soil.  Initial test
results from sediment  samples taken from nearby Superior Bay were  inconsistent
with  MGP-like  chemicals.  Additional  samples were obtained in March 2003 from
Superior  Bay near the site of the former  MGP.  The report on this  sampling is
expected to be  completed  by the end of August  2003.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter at this time.

In May 2002  Minnesota  Power  received  and  subsequently  responded to a third
request from the EPA,  under Section 114 of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990  (Clean  Air Act),  seeking  additional  information  regarding  capital
expenditures at all of its coal-fired  generating stations.  This action is part
of an  industry-wide  investigation  assessing  compliance  with the New  Source
Review and the New Source Performance  Standards (emissions standards that apply
to new and changed units) of the Clean Air Act at electric generating  stations.
We are unable to predict  whether the EPA will take any action on this matter or
whether Minnesota Power will be required to incur any costs as a result.

In June 2002 Minnkota Power, the operator of Square Butte,  received a Notice of
Violation  from the EPA regarding  alleged New Source  Review  violations at the
M.R.  Young Station which  includes the Square Butte  generating  unit.  The EPA
claims  certain  capital  projects  completed by Minnkota Power should have gone
through the New Source Review  process  potentially  resulting in new air permit
operating  conditions.  The  Company  is unable to predict  the  outcome of this
matter  or the  magnitude  of costs  should  additional  pollution  controls  be
required.  Minnesota  Power is  obligated  to pay its pro rata  share of  Square
Butte's  costs  based on  Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to the  Square  Butte
generating unit's output.

NET INCOME

The  following net income  discussion  summarizes a comparison of the six months
ended June 30, 2003 to the six months ended June 30, 2002.

ENERGY  SERVICES'  net  income was  slightly  higher  than last year  reflecting
increased sales of nonregulated generation,  improved wholesale power prices and
more sales  activity  at our  telecommunications  business.  Increased  sales of
nonregulated  generation resulted from facilities being available for a full six
months in 2003.  Nonregulated generation facilities first came online at various
times during the first half of 2002. In 2002 net income  included a $2.8 million
after-tax  mark-to-market  accounting  gain on the Kendall County power purchase
agreement as required by accounting rules. These mark-to-market accounting rules
were  rescinded  in late 2002,  and this $2.8  million  gain was reversed in the
fourth quarter.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  reported a $5.9  million,  or 11 percent,  increase in net
income in 2003 in spite of  difficult  market  conditions.  The  increase in net
income was  attributable  to increased  vehicle sales,  lower interest  expense,
modest fee increases and efficiency gains at our auction facilities, and reduced
bad debt expense at AFC, our floorplan financing business. Year-to-date vehicles
sold were up 2 percent at our wholesale auction facilities and 10 percent at our
total  loss  auction  facilities.  Interest  expense  was down due to lower debt
balances,  and bad debt  expense  at AFC was  down  reflecting  improved  credit
quality of the receivable portfolio and strong receivable portfolio  management.
For the six months  ended June 30,  2003 AFC  contributed  29 percent of the net
income for Automotive Services (30 percent in 2002).

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  We believe EBITDA provides  meaningful  additional
information that helps us monitor and evaluate our ongoing operating results and
trends,   and  facilitates  an  understanding   of  our  comparative   operating
performance.  EBITDA  should not be  considered in isolation nor as a substitute
for measures of performance  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA is not an
alternative  to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  and may not be  comparable
with  EBITDA  as  defined  by other  companies.  EBITDA is a common  measure  of
operating  performance considered by  investors, financial  analysts  and rating
agencies.

</TABLE>

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES' financial results in 2003 reflected more real
estate sales  partially  offset by losses on the sale of shares we held directly
in publicly-traded  emerging technology investments.  Financial results for 2002
included gains on the sale of certain emerging technology investments and losses
related to our trading  securities  portfolio which was subsequently  liquidated
during the third quarter of 2002.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS' net income was up $6.5 million in 2003. Net income from
our Water Services businesses in 2003 reflected $10.4 million in after-tax gains
on the  condemnation  of  Florida  Water's  utility  systems  in Nassau  (Amelia
Island), Clay and Bradford counties.  These gains were offset by $7.9 million of
after-tax  expense  associated  with the  sale of our  water  assets  and a $2.2
million accrual for employee retention and severance  incentives.  Despite a 2.9
percent  increase  in total  customers,  water  consumption  was down 11 percent
because in 2003 above normal  precipitation  decreased  consumption  and in 2002
drier  weather  conditions   increased   consumption.   Net  income  from  other
discontinued  operations  in 2003  included  a $1.3  million  recovery  from the
settlement of a lawsuit associated with our auto transport  business,  while net
income  in 2002  included  $3.9  million  of exit  charges  related  to the auto
transport business and the retail stores.


COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 AND 2002

ENERGY SERVICES

UTILITY operations include retail and wholesale rate regulated  activities under
the    jurisdiction    of   state   and    federal    regulatory    authorities.
NONREGULATED/NONUTILITY  operations consist of nonregulated generation (non-rate
base generation sold at market-based rates to the wholesale market), coal mining
and telecommunication activities.  Nonregulated generation consists primarily of
the Taconite Harbor Energy Center in northern  Minnesota and generation  secured
through the Kendall County power purchase  agreement,  a 15-year  agreement with
NRG Energy at a facility near Chicago, Illinois.

OPERATING REVENUE in total was up $4.4 million, or 3 percent, in 2003 reflecting
increases  from both  utility and  nonregulated/nonutility  operations.  UTILITY
operating revenue was up $3.9 million,  or 3 percent,  mainly due to higher fuel
clause  recoveries.  Improved  wholesale power prices and higher gas prices also
contributed to the increase in operating  revenue.  Utility  kilowatthour  sales
were similar to the second quarter of last year. NONREGULATED/NONUTILITY revenue
increased $0.5 million, or 2 percent, in 2003 as increased sales of nonregulated
generation,  improved  wholesale  power  prices and more sales  activity  at our
telecommunications  business offset a mark-to-market accounting gain recorded in
2002. Increased sales of nonregulated  generation resulted from facilities being
available for a full three months in 2003.  Nonregulated  generation  facilities
first came online at various times during the first half of 2002. As required by
accounting rules, a $4.7 million pre-tax  mark-to-market  accounting gain on the
Kendall  County  power  purchase   agreement  was  recorded  in  June  2002  and
subsequently reversed in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in both 2003 and 2002.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both
2003 and 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES in total were up $9.6 million, or 7 percent, in 2003. UTILITY
operating expenses were up $2.5 million, or 2 percent, in 2003 reflecting higher
purchased    power   and   gas    expense   and    general    cost    increases.
NONREGULATED/NONUTILITY   operating  expenses  increased  $7.1  million,  or  24
percent, over the prior year mainly due to fuel and purchased power expenses for
nonregulated  generation  that came  online  during  the first  half of 2002 and
direct  costs  related to  increased  sales  activity at our  telecommunications
business.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $23.9 million, or 11 percent, in 2003. Revenue from our
wholesale  auction  facilities  was higher in 2003  primarily  due to  increased
sales,  a sales mix shift and modest fee  increases  implemented  at some of our
auction  facilities.  The  number  of  vehicles  sold at our  wholesale  auction
facilities  increased 4 percent.  The increased  volume in commercial  accounts,
which resulted in additional reconditioning services, offset a decline in dealer
consignment  sales.  A commercial  account is a non-dealer  consignor  such as a
manufacturer,  leasing  company,  insurance  company,  bank or finance  company,
business fleet or rental company.

Revenue from our total loss auction  facilities was up in 2003  reflecting an 11
percent  increase in vehicles  sold and  expansion  into new markets,  including
combination sites at some of our wholesale auction facilities.

While the number of vehicles financed by AFC was similar to last year due to the
softness  of the  economy,  revenue  from AFC was higher in 2003  because  lower
interest rates in 2003 reduced interest  borrowing expense and strong receivable
portfolio management lowered bad debt expense.

OPERATING EXPENSES were up $16.6 million,  or 10 percent,  in 2003 primarily due
to additional expenses incurred for reconditioning services provided as a result
of a sales mix shift that has added more commercial accounts. Operating expenses
were also impacted by lower conversion rates at our Canadian  wholesale  auction
facilities which increased direct costs associated with processing vehicles
multiple times.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

OPERATING  REVENUE was up $5.7 million in 2003  primarily due to four large real
estate  sales  which  contributed  $7.9  million to  revenue.  Revenue  from our
emerging technology investments was down $6.8 million in 2003 because revenue in
2003 included  $3.5 million of losses  related to the sale of shares the Company
held directly in publicly-traded investments and revenue in 2002 included a $3.3
million gain on the sale of certain  investments.  Revenue in 2002 also included
losses related to our trading  securities  portfolio which was liquidated during
the second half of 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES were up $1.3 million in 2003 primarily due to higher expenses
related to our real estate operations  because the cost of property sold in 2003
was higher than in 2002.


COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 AND 2002

ENERGY SERVICES

OPERATING  REVENUE  in  total  was up  $40.6  million,  or 14  percent,  in 2003
reflecting increases from both utility and  nonregulated/nonutility  operations.
UTILITY  operating  revenue was up $21.1  million,  or 9 percent,  mainly due to
higher fuel clause recoveries, improved wholesale power prices and earnings from
Split Rock Energy.  Fuel clause  recoveries  increased  due to higher  purchased
power.  Results  from Split Rock Energy were up in 2003 due to  increased  power
marketing  opportunities  and higher  wholesale  power prices.  Revenue from gas
sales were also up in 2003 due to higher gas prices.  Utility kilowatthour sales
were up 1 percent  from last  year.  NONREGULATED/NONUTILITY  revenue  increased
$19.5  million  in  2003  primarily  due  to  increased  sales  of  nonregulated
generation,  improved  wholesale  power  prices and more sales  activity  at our
telecommunications business. Increased sales of nonregulated generation resulted
from  facilities  being  available  for a full six months in 2003.  Nonregulated
generation  facilities  first came online at various times during the first half
of 2002. As required by accounting rules, a $4.7 million pre-tax  mark-to-market

<PAGE>

OPERATING EXPENSES in total were up $40.8 million,  or 15 percent,  in 2003. The
increase was  primarily  attributable  to  increased  fuel and  purchased  power
expenses.  UTILITY operating  expenses were up $14.0 million,  or 7 percent,  in
2003  primarily  due to increased  purchased  power and gas expense,  generating
station  maintenance  expense and employment costs. Higher purchased power costs
resulted from both  increased  wholesale  prices and quantities  purchased.  Gas
expense was higher in 2003 due to increased prices.  Planned maintenance outages
at Company generating stations necessitated higher quantities of purchased power
this  year.  Higher  gas  prices in 2003 also  contributed  to the  increase  in
operating expenses.  NONREGULATED/NONUTILITY  operating expenses increased $26.8
million over the prior year mainly due to fuel and purchased  power expenses for
nonregulated  generation  that  came  online  during  the  first  half of  2002.
Purchased power expense in 2003 included six months of demand charges related to
the Kendall County power purchase agreement while 2002 included only two months.
The Kendall County  agreement  began in May 2002.  Operating  expenses were also
higher  in  2003  due to  increased  sales  activity  at our  telecommunications
business.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $48.0 million, or 11 percent, in 2003. Revenue from our
wholesale  auction  facilities  was higher in 2003  primarily  due to  increased
sales,  a sales mix shift and modest fee  increases  implemented  at some of our
auction facilities.  At our wholesale auction facilities 2 percent more vehicles
were sold in 2003. The increased volume in commercial  accounts,  which resulted
in additional  reconditioning  services,  offset a decline in dealer consignment
sales.

Revenue from our total loss auction  facilities  was up in 2003  reflecting a 10
percent  increase in vehicles  sold and  expansion  into new markets,  including
combination sites at some of our wholesale auction facilities.

While the number of vehicles  financed by AFC was down  slightly  from last year
due to the  softness  of the  economy,  revenue  from  AFC  was  higher  in 2003
primarily  because  strong  receivable  portfolio  management  lowered  bad debt
expense.

OPERATING EXPENSES were up $38.0 million,  or 11 percent,  in 2003 primarily due
to additional expenses incurred for reconditioning services provided as a result
of a sales mix shift that has added more  commercial  accounts,  and  additional
costs  incurred  because of  inclement  weather.  Operating  expenses  were also
impacted by lower  conversion rates at our Canadian  wholesale  vehicle auctions
which increased direct costs associated with processing vehicles multiple times.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

OPERATING  REVENUE  remained  constant  in 2003 as more real  estate  sales were
offset by less revenue from our emerging technology  investments.  In 2003 eight
large real estate sales  contributed  $14.5 million to revenue  compared to 2002
when two large real estate sales contributed $4.9 million to revenue. In 2003 we
recognized $3.5 million of losses related to the sale of shares the Company held
directly in publicly-traded  emerging technology  investments,  while in 2002 we
recognized  a $3.3  million  gain on the  sale of  certain  emerging  technology
investments.  Revenue in 2002 also  included  losses on our  trading  securities
portfolio which was liquidated during the second half of 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $4.4 million, or 14 percent, in 2003 in part due to
lower incentive compensation expense and interest expense.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Certain accounting  measurements under applicable  generally accepted accounting
principles involve management's judgment about subjective factors and estimates,
the effects of which are inherently uncertain.  Accounting  measurements that we
believe are most critical to our reported  results of  operations  and financial
condition  include:   uncollectible   receivables  and  allowance  for  doubtful
accounts,   impairment   of  goodwill  and   long-lived   assets,   pension  and
postretirement  health  and  life  actuarial   assumptions,   and  valuation  of
investments. These policies are summarized in our 2002 Form 10-K.

OUTLOOK

We remain  focused on  continuously  improving the  performance  of our two core
businesses, Energy and Automotive Services, and monetizing those businesses that
are  non-strategic  or non-core.  Our two core businesses  remain strong and are
poised for earnings growth in their  respective  markets as economic  conditions
improve.  With solid  financial  results  for the first six months of 2003,  our
total year expectations have not changed.

We are  continuing  to  pursue  the sale of our  Water  Services  businesses  in
Florida,  North  Carolina  and  Georgia.  During  the first six  months of 2003,
through condemnation proceedings, Florida Water sold its Amelia Island water and
wastewater  assets to Nassau  County  and its  water  and  wastewater  assets in
Bradford and Clay counties to the Clay County  Utility  Authority.  The combined
transactions  resulted  in a total  after-tax  gain of $10.4  million  which was
included  in our 2003  earnings  from  discontinued  operations.  In July  2003,
through another  condemnation  proceeding,  Florida Water sold its Martin County
water and wastewater  assets to Martin County for $2.4 million.  The transaction
resulted  in an  after-tax  gain of $0.5  million  which will be included in our
third  quarter  2003  earnings  from   discontinued   operations.   Condemnation
proceedings have also been initiated in Marion County for Florida Water's assets
in that county which serve approximately 15,000 customers.

On July 24, 2003 Florida Water signed a purchase  agreement to sell seven of its
Florida water and  wastewater  systems to  governmental  entities in Florida for
$296 million  payable at closing.  The  transaction  is expected to result in an
after-tax gain of approximately  $55 million.  The water and wastewater  systems
included  in this  purchase  agreement  represent  approximately  two-thirds  of
Florida  Water's assets and constitute  systems serving the counties of Osceola,
Hernando,  Citrus,  Lee and Charlotte,  and the  communities of Marco Island and
Palm Coast. These systems combined serve  approximately  152,000 customers.  The
cash  proceeds  after  transaction  costs,  retirement of Florida Water debt and
payment  of income  taxes are  estimated  at $158  million,  and will be used to
retire debt at ALLETE.  The sale is expected to close by the end of 2003 pending
satisfaction  of certain  contingencies  and  regulatory  approvals  in Florida.
Florida  Water  will  continue  to seek  buyers  for  its  remaining  water  and
wastewater  facilities.  Systems for which governmental buyers are not found are
expected to be sold to a private buyer.

We are using an investment banking firm to facilitate the sale of Water Services
businesses in North Carolina and Georgia.  Discussions with  prospective  buyers
are in process.  We expect to enter into agreements to sell these  businesses in
2003. The proceeds from selling our Water Services  businesses  will give us the
ability to reduce debt, which will further strengthen our balance sheet.

Our Board of Directors and management remain committed to unlocking the value of
ALLETE. We continue to review,  both internally and with outside  advisors,  the
benefits and risks of separating our Energy and Automotive  Services  businesses
into independent companies. When we ultimately reach a decision as to whether we
will separate our  businesses,  we will inform the market at that time through a
filing with the SEC. We are unable to predict the timing of that decision.

ENERGY SERVICES. While our power marketing activities benefited from higher than
expected  wholesale  power  prices  during the first six  months of 2003,  it is
uncertain  whether higher prices will continue for the remainder of the year. We
anticipate  2003 net income from Energy  Services to be similar to 2002.  Global
economic  conditions  continue to affect our largest industrial retail customers
and are likely to  continue  over the next few years,  as  consolidation  in the
steel and  taconite  industries  continues,  and while paper and pulp  companies
search for even more  efficiency  and  cost-cutting  measures  to compete in the
marketplace.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES. We continue to anticipate earnings from Automotive Services
to  increase  by about 15 percent in 2003.  In 2003  vehicles  sold  through our
wholesale and total loss auction facilities combined are expected to increase by
4 percent to 7 percent,  and the number of  vehicles  financed  through  AFC  is
expected to  increase by 5 percent.  However,  it will be  difficult  to achieve
these growth targets if economic conditions do not improve.  Automotive Services
is  focusing on growth in the volume of vehicles  sold and  financed,  increased
ancillary services, and operating and technological efficiencies.  Selective fee
increases  have been  implemented  and more will be  considered.  The opening of
total loss auction facilities in Fremont, California; Medford (Long Island), New
York;  and Manville,  New Jersey,  during the first six months of 2003 will also
contribute  to 2003  earnings as will the new  wholesale  auction  facilities in
Yaphank (Long Island), New York; Atlanta,  Georgia;  and Edmonton,  Alberta. The
wholesale  auction  facility  in  Yaphank,  which  opened  in  June  2003,  is a
greenfield  site  (a  newly  constructed  facility  in a new  market).  The  new
wholesale auction  facilities in Atlanta and Edmonton are under construction and
will replace aging facilities. Both are slated to open later this year.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES

A primary goal of our  strategic  plan is to improve cash flow from  operations.
Our  strategy  includes  growing the  businesses  both  internally  by expanding
facilities,  services and operations (see Capital Requirements),  and externally
through  acquisitions.  During  the  first  six  months  of 2003  cash flow from
operating  activities  reflected strong operating results and continued focus on
working capital management.  Cash flow from operations was higher in 2002 due to
the timing of the  collection  of certain  finance  receivables  outstanding  at
December 31, 2001.  Cash flow from  operations  was also affected by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.

WORKING  CAPITAL.  As of June 30, 2003 our working capital needs included $283.1
million  of  long-term  debt due  later in 2003.  (See  Securities.)  Additional
working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  During the second  half of 2002 we  liquidated  our  trading
securities  portfolio  and used the  proceeds  to reduce  our  short-term  debt.
Approximately  4.1  million  original  issue  shares  of our  common  stock  are
available for issuance  through  INVEST  DIRECT,  our direct stock  purchase and
dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided. ADESA, however, has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC offers short-term  on-site financing for dealers to purchase vehicles mostly
at  auctions  and  takes a  security  interest  in each  vehicle  financed.  The
financing  is  provided  through  the  earlier of the date the dealer  sells the
vehicle or a general  borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC has  arrangements  to
use  proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper  issued by ALLETE to meet its
short-term working capital requirements.

Significant changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at June
30, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 were due to increased sales and financing
activity  at  Automotive  Services.  Typically  auction  volumes are down during
December  because  of the  holidays.  As a  result,  ADESA  and AFC  had  higher
receivables and higher payables at June 30, 2003.

AFC RECEIVABLES.  AFC, through a wholly owned,  consolidated  subsidiary,  sells
certain  finance   receivables   through  a  revolving  private   securitization
structure.  The  securitization  agreement  allows for the revolving sale by the
subsidiary  to third  parties of up to $500  million in  undivided  interests in
eligible finance receivables. The securitization agreement expires in 2005.

AFC managed total receivables of $524.9 million at June 30, 2003 ($495.1 million
at December 31, 2002); $211.1 million of this amount represent receivables which
were included in accounts  receivable on our consolidated  balance sheet ($191.3
million at  December  31,  2002) and $313.8  million  of this  amount  represent
receivables sold in undivided  interests  through the  securitization  agreement
($303.8  million at  December  31,  2002)  which are  off-balance  sheet.  AFC's
proceeds  from the sale of the  receivables  to third parties were used to repay
borrowings  from  ALLETE  and fund new  loans  to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the
subsidiary  must each  maintain  certain  financial  covenants  such as  minimum
tangible net worth to comply with the terms of the securitization agreement. AFC
has historically  performed better than the covenant thresholds set forth in the
securitization   agreement.   We  are  not  currently   aware  of  any  changing
circumstances that would put AFC in noncompliance with the covenants.

SPLIT ROCK ENERGY. We provide up to $50.0 million in credit support, in the form
of letters of credit and financial guarantees, to facilitate the power marketing
activities  of Split Rock Energy.  At June 30, 2003 this credit  support  backed
$1.7 million of Split Rock  Energy's  liabilities  ($7.3 million at December 31,
2002).  The credit  support  generally  expires within one year from the date of
issuance.

SALE OF WATER PLANT ASSETS.  In March 2003,  through a condemnation  proceeding,
Florida  Water  sold its Amelia  Island  water and  wastewater  assets to Nassau
County in Florida for $17.5 million.  The  transaction  resulted in an after-tax
gain of $9.8 million which was included in our 2003  earnings from  discontinued
operations.  The system serves 5,000  customers.  For an additional fee, Florida
Water will  continue to operate the system for Nassau County for a period of 120
days or for such additional period of time as may be agreed to by the parties.

In May 2003, through a condemnation proceeding, Florida Water sold its water and
wastewater  assets in Bradford  and Clay  counties in Florida to the Clay County
Utility  Authority for $4.3 million.  The  transaction  resulted in an after-tax
gain of $0.6 million which was included in our 2003  earnings from  discontinued
operations.  The systems serve 1,500  customers.  For an additional fee, Florida
Water will  continue  to operate  the systems for Clay County for a period of 90
days.

In July 2003, through another  condemnation  proceeding,  Florida Water sold its
Martin County water and wastewater assets to Martin County for $2.4 million. The
transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of $0.5 million which will be included
in our third  quarter 2003 earnings from  discontinued  operations.  The systems
serve 1,300 customers.

Proceeds  from these  condemnations  will be used to reduce debt and for general
corporate purposes.

SECURITIES.  In March 2001  ALLETE,  ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE  Capital III,
jointly filed a  registration  statement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement,  which has been declared
effective by the SEC, relates to the possible issuance of a remaining  aggregate
amount of $387 million of  securities  which may include  ALLETE  common  stock,
first mortgage bonds and other debt securities, and ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE
Capital  III  preferred  trust  securities.   ALLETE  also  previously  filed  a
registration  statement,  which has been declared effective by the SEC, relating
to the possible  issuance of $25 million of first  mortgage bonds and other debt
securities.  We may sell all or a portion of the remaining registered securities
if warranted by market  conditions and our capital  requirements.  Any offer and
sale  of the  above  mentioned  securities  will  be made  only  by  means  of a
prospectus  meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

In June 2003 ADESA  restructured its financial  arrangements with respect to its
wholesale   auction   facilities   located   in   Tracy,   California;   Boston,
Massachusetts;  Charlotte,  North  Carolina;  and  Knoxville,  Tennessee.  These
wholesale auction facilities were previously  accounted for as operating leases.
The  transactions  included the assumption of $28 million of long-term debt, the
issuance of $45 million of long-term debt and the  recognition of $73 million of
property, plant and equipment. The $28 million of assumed long-term debt matures
April 1,  2020 and has a  variable  interest  rate  equal  to the  seven-day  AA
Financial  Commercial Paper Rate plus approximately  1.2%, while the $45 million
of long-term  debt issued to finance the  wholesale  auction  facility in Tracy,
California,  matures July 30, 2006 and has a variable  interest rate of prime or
LIBOR plus 1%.

In July 2003 ALLETE  used  internally  generated  funds to retire $25 million in
principal  amount of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds,  Series 6 1/4% due July
1, 2003.

In July 2003 ALLETE entered into a credit  agreement to borrow $250 million from
a  consortium  of  financial  institutions,  the  proceeds of which were used to
redeem $250 million of the  Company's  Floating  Rate First  Mortgage  Bonds due
October  20,  2003.  The July 2003  credit  agreement  expires in July 2004,  is
subject  to  interest  at LIBOR  plus  0.875%  and is secured by the lien of the
Company's  Mortgage  and Deed of Trust.  The credit  agreement  also has certain
mandatory  prepayment  provisions,  including a  requirement  to repay an amount
equal to 75 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of water assets.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

As a result of the delay in selling our Water  Services  business,  consolidated
capital expenditures for 2003 are now expected to be $172 million.  Consolidated
capital  expenditures  for the six months  ended  June 30,  2003  totaled  $73.6
million  ($97.5 million in 2002).  Expenditures  for 2003 included $38.1 million
for Energy Services and $18.9 million for Automotive Services.  Expenditures for
2003 also included $16.6 million to maintain our Water Services businesses while
they are in the process of being sold. An existing  long-term line of credit and
internally  generated  funds  were the  primary  sources  of  funding  for these
expenditures. The 2003 capital expenditure amounts do not include $73 million of
property,  plant and equipment  recognized upon the  restructuring  of financial
arrangements with respect to four of our wholesale auction facilities previously
accounted for as operating leases.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In  January  2003 the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No.  46,  "Consolidation  of
Variable Interest  Entities." In general, a variable interest entity is one with
equity  investors  that do not have voting  rights or do not provide  sufficient
financial  resources  for the entity to support  its  activities.  Under the new
rules,  variable  interest  entities will be  consolidated  by the party that is
subject to the  majority of the risk of loss or entitled to the  majority of the
residual returns. The new rules are effective  immediately for variable interest
entities  created  after  January 31, 2003 and in the third  quarter of 2003 for
previously existing variable interest entities.  In June 2003 ADESA restructured
its  financial  arrangements  with  respect  to  four of its  wholesale  auction
facilities  previously  accounted  for as  operating  leases.  The  transactions
included the  assumption of $28 million of long-term  debt,  the issuance of $45
million of long-term debt and the recognition of $73 million in property,  plant
and  equipment.  Interpretation  No. 46 would have required ADESA to consolidate
the lessor under the lease arrangements in place prior to the restructuring.  We
are not a party to any variable interest entity required to be consolidated upon
the adoption of Interpretation 46.

In May 2003  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Financial
Instruments  with  Characteristics  of both Liabilities and Equity." In general,
SFAS 150  establishes  standards for  classification  and measurement of certain
financial  instruments with the  characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
Mandatorily  redeemable financial  instruments must be classified as a liability
and the related payments must be reported as interest expense. The new rules are
effective  immediately for financial instruments entered into after May 31, 2003
and in the third quarter of 2003 for previously existing financial  instruments.
Beginning  with the third quarter of 2003, we will be required to reclassify our
Mandatorily  Redeemable  Preferred Securities of ALLETE Capital I as a long-term
liability and reclassify the quarterly  distributions as interest expense.  This
will be a reclassification only and will not impact our results of operations.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

SECURITIES INVESTMENTS

Our securities  investments  include  certain  securities held for an indefinite
period  of  time  which  are  accounted  for as  available-for-sale  securities.
Available-for-sale  securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized  gains
and losses  included in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income,  net of tax.
Unrealized  losses that are other than temporary are recognized in earnings.  At
June  30,  2003  our   available-for-sale   securities  portfolio  consisted  of
securities in a grantor trust established to fund certain employee benefits. Our
available-for-sale  securities  portfolio  had a fair value of $14.2  million at
June 30,  2003  ($20.9  million at  December  31,  2002) and a total  unrealized
after-tax  gain of $0.3 million at June 30, 2003 ($2.8  million loss at December
31, 2002).  During the second  quarter of 2003 we sold the  investments  we held
directly in our publicly-traded  Emerging Technology  portfolio and recognized a
$2.3 million  after-tax loss at June 30, 2003.  These  publicly-traded  emerging
technology investments were accounted for as available-for-sale securities prior
to sale.

As part of our Emerging  Technology  portfolio,  we also have  several  minority
investments  in venture  capital funds and  privately-held  start-up  companies.
These  investments  are  accounted  for using the cost  method and  included  in
Investments on our consolidated balance sheet. The total carrying value of these
investments  was $39.7  million at June 30, 2003 ($38.7  million at December 31,
2002). Our policy is to periodically  review these investments for impairment by
assessing such factors as continued commercial viability of products,  cash flow
and earnings. Any impairment would reduce the carrying value of the investment.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

Our foreign currency  exposure is limited to the conversion of operating results
of our Canadian and Mexican  subsidiaries.  We have not entered into any foreign
exchange  contracts to hedge the conversion of our Canadian or Mexican operating
results into United States dollars.

POWER MARKETING

Minnesota Power purchases power for retail sales in our electric utility service
territory and sells excess generation in the wholesale market. We have about 500
MW of nonregulated  generation  available for sale to the wholesale market.  Our
nonregulated  generation  includes about 225 MW from Taconite Harbor in northern
Minnesota  that  was  acquired  in  October  2001.  It also  includes  275 MW of
generation  obtained through a 15-year  agreement,  which commenced in May 2002,
with NRG Energy at the Kendall County facility near Chicago, Illinois. Under the
Kendall County agreement,  we pay a fixed capacity charge for the right, but not
the  obligation,  to capacity and energy from a 275 MW  generating  unit. We are
responsible  for  arranging  the natural gas fuel supply and are entitled to the
electricity  produced.  Our  strategy  is to sell a  significant  portion of our
nonregulated  generation through long-term  contracts of various durations.  The
balance  will be sold in the  spot  market  through  short-term  agreements.  We
currently have long-term  forward capacity and energy sales contracts for 100 MW
of Kendall County generation,  with 50 MW expiring in April 2012 and the balance
in September 2017. In the first quarter of 2003 we entered into an additional 30
MW long-term  forward  capacity and energy sale contract that begins  January 1,
2004 and expires in September 2017. Neither the Kendall County agreement nor the
related  sales  contracts  are  derivatives  under  SFAS  133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

The services of Split Rock Energy are used to fulfill purchase  requirements for
retail  load and to market  excess  generation.  We own 50 percent of Split Rock
Energy which is a joint venture between  Minnesota Power and Great River Energy.
The joint  venture was formed to provide us with least cost  supply,  to provide
generation outage protection, to maximize the value of our generation assets and
to maximize power marketing revenue within prescribed limits.  Split Rock Energy
operates in the wholesale energy markets, and engages in marketing activities by
entering  into  forward  and  option  contracts  for the  purchase  and  sale of
electricity.  These contracts are primarily short-term in nature with maturities
of less than one year.  Although Split Rock Energy generally attempts to balance
its purchase and sale  positions,  commodity  price risk sometimes  exists or is
created.  This risk is actively  managed through a risk management  program that
includes  policies,  procedures and limits  established by the Split Rock Energy
Board of Governors. Minnesota Power holds two seats on this four member Board.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain a system of controls and procedures  designed to provide  reasonable
assurance  as  to  the  reliability  of  the  financial   statements  and  other
disclosures  included  in  this  report,  as well as to  safeguard  assets  from
unauthorized  use or disposition.  We evaluated the  effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure  controls and procedures  under the  supervision
and with the participation of management,  including our chief executive officer
and chief  financial  officer,  as of the end of the period covered by this Form
10-Q.  Based  upon  that  evaluation,  our  chief  executive  officer  and chief
financial  officer  concluded  that our  disclosure  controls and procedures are
effective  in  timely  alerting  them to  material  information  required  to be
included in our periodic SEC filings.  There has been no  significant  change in
our internal  control over  financial  reporting  that occurred  during our most
recent fiscal quarter that has materially  affected,  or is reasonable likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Due to  insufficient  taconite  pellet  orders,  Eveleth Mines LLC ceased pellet
production  in mid-May  2003 and placed  the plant on  standby  status  allowing
production to resume later in 2003 if orders are received.

In May 2003  International  Steel  Group,  Inc.  completed  the  acquisition  of
Bethlehem  Steel Corp.'s mills and other  property,  including  Bethlehem  Steel
Corp.'s 62.3 percent share of Hibbing Taconite Co.

On  May  20,  2003  U.S.  Steel  Corp.   (USS)   completed  the  acquisition  of
substantially  all of  National  Steel  Corporation's  assets.  The  acquisition
included National Steel Pellet Company (National Steel) in Keewatin,  Minnesota,
which was renamed USS Keewatin  Taconite.  USS has agreed in principal to assume
the terms of an amended electric  service  contract between  Minnesota Power and
National  Steel. A new large power contract is expected to be executed in August
2003.

With the start-up of Missota Paper at the former  Potlatch  Corporation-Brainerd
site, the 10 MW large power contract with Potlatch for Brainerd and Grand Rapids
has been  re-negotiated.  The new  contract  provides  for Grand  Rapids to take
service under the large light and power service  schedule through December 2008.
In addition, Potlatch will guarantee the demand payments at Missota Paper should
Missota Paper be unable to make the demand  payments  guaranteed by the previous
contract. In total,  Minnesota Power has the same take-or-pay protection through
December 2008 as under the previous contract.

                  ALLETE,   INC.,  a  corporation  of  the  State  of  Minnesota
(hereinafter called the "Company"),  for value received,  hereby promises to pay
to                               ,  as agent (the "Agent"),  on behalf of itself
   ------------------------------
and the Lenders (as defined  below),  or  registered  assigns,  at the office or
agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York,

                                         Dollars ($                     )

"Maturity Date") or upon earlier declaration of acceleration or redemption.

                  This bond is [a  temporary  bond and] one of an issue of bonds
of the  Company  issuable  in series  and is one of a series  known as its First
Mortgage  Bonds,  Collateral  Series A,

<PAGE>

all bonds of all  series  issued  and to be issued  under  and  equally  secured
(except in so far as any sinking or other fund,  established in accordance  with
the  provisions of the Mortgage  hereinafter  mentioned,  may afford  additional
security for the bonds of any particular series) by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust
(herein,  together  with  any  indenture  supplemental  thereto,  including  the
Twenty-second  Supplemental  Indenture  dated  as of July 1,  2003,  called  the
"Mortgage"),  dated as of September 1, 1945,  executed by the Company  (formerly
Minnesota Power & Light Company and formerly  Minnesota  Power,  Inc.) to Irving
Trust  Company  (now The Bank of New  York) and  Richard  H.  West  (Douglas  J.
MacInnes successor), as Trustees.

                  The bonds of this series shall not bear interest.

                  This bond is issued to the Agent by the  Company  pursuant  to
the Company's  obligations  under the Credit Agreement dated as of July 18, 2003
(as amended, supplemented, restated, extended or otherwise modified from time to
time,  the  "Credit  Agreement"),  among  the  Company,  the Agent and the other
lenders party thereto from time to time (collectively, the "Lenders"), including
any amendments or extensions  thereto that may be subsequent to the date hereof.
This  bond  shall  be held by the  Agent  subject  to the  terms  of the  Credit
Agreement  and the  Security  Agreement  dated as of July 18,  2003  between the
Company and Wells  Fargo Bank,  National  Association,  as agent (the  "Security
Agreement").

                  It shall be an  additional  term and condition of the bonds of
this series that,  in the event (i) an Event of Default  under and as defined in
the Credit  Agreement has occurred under Section 7.1(a) of the Credit  Agreement
by reason of a failure by the Company to make a payment of principal or interest
when the same shall be due and payable  pursuant to the Credit Agreement or (ii)
the Notes (as  defined in the Credit  Agreement)  are  declared  due and payable
pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Credit  Agreement,  then the occurrence of either
such event shall be deemed, upon receipt of written notice from the Agent to the
Corporate  Trustee of the  occurrence  thereof,  to be a Default for purposes of
Section 65 of Article XIII of the Mortgage, and the definition of Default in the
Mortgage is modified accordingly for purposes of the bonds of this series.

                  In the event (i) an Event of  Default  under and as defined in
the Credit  Agreement has occurred under Section 7.1(a) of the Credit  Agreement
by reason of a failure by the Company to make a payment of principal or interest
when the same shall be due and payable  pursuant to the Credit Agreement or (ii)
the Notes (as  defined in the Credit  Agreement)  are  declared  due and payable
pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Credit  Agreement  and, in the case of either (i)
or (ii),  the Agent shall give written  notice to the Company and the  Corporate
Trustee of such event,  then on such date the Company  shall redeem the bonds of
this  series  in whole at a  redemption  price  equal  to the  principal  amount
thereof. The provisions in the immediately preceding sentence are subject in all
instances to the  limitations  on the amounts  collectible  on the bonds of this
series  provided  for in Section  5(d) of the  Security  Agreement.  The Company
hereby  waives  its  right to have any  notice  of  redemption  pursuant  to the
foregoing  sentence  state that such  notice is  subject  to the  receipt of the
redemption moneys by the Corporate Trustee before the date fixed for redemption.

                  The  Corporate  Trustee  may  conclusively  presume  that  the
obligation  of the Company to pay the  principal  of the bonds of this series as
the  same  shall  become  due and  payable,  whether  at  maturity,  redemption,
acceleration or otherwise, shall have been fully satisfied and discharged unless
and until it shall  have  received  a written  notice  from the Agent  under the
Credit Agreement, signed by its President or a Vice President,  stating that the
payment of  principal  of the bonds of this  series has not been fully paid when
due and specifying the amount of funds required to make such payment.

                  This bond has been  issued by the  Company to the Agent to (i)
provide for the payment of the  Company's  obligations  to make  payments to any
person under the Credit  Agreement and (ii) provide to such persons the benefits
of the security provided for this bond pursuant to the Mortgage. The obligations
of the  Company  under the bonds of this series may be  discharged  prior to the
Maturity Date under the circumstances set forth in the Security Agreement.

                  Bonds of this series are not subject to a sinking fund.  Bonds
of this series are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

                  Reference  is made to the Mortgage  for a  description  of the
property  mortgaged  and  pledged,  the nature and extent of the  security,  the
rights of the holders of the bonds and of the Trustees in respect  thereof,  the
duties and  immunities of the Trustees and the terms and  conditions  upon which
the bonds are and are to be secured and the circumstances under which additional
bonds may be  issued.  The  rights of the holder of this bond to vote or consent
under the Mortgage in respect of this bond shall be limited to the extent and in
the manner specified in the Security Agreement.  With the consent of the Company
and to the extent  permitted by and as provided in the Mortgage,  the rights and
obligations  of the Company and/or the rights of the holders of the bonds and/or
coupons  and/or the terms and  provisions  of the  Mortgage  may be  modified or
altered by affirmative  vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% principal amount
of the bonds  then  outstanding  under the  Mortgage  and,  if the rights of the
holders of one or more, but less than all, series of bonds then  outstanding are
to be affected, then also by affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3%
in principal  amount of the bonds then outstanding of each series of bonds so to
be affected  (excluding in any case bonds  disqualified from voting by reason of
the Company's  interest  therein as provided in the  Mortgage);  provided  that,
without the consent of the holder  hereof,  no such  modification  or alteration
shall,  among other things,  impair or affect the right of the holder to receive
payment of the principal of (and premium,  if any) and interest on this bond, on
or after the respective due dates  expressed  herein,  or permit the creation of
any lien equal or prior to the lien of the Mortgage or deprive the holder of the
benefit of a lien on the mortgaged and pledged property.

                  The  principal  hereof may be declared or may become due prior
to the Maturity Date hereinbefore named on the conditions,  in the manner and at
the time set forth in the Mortgage,  upon the  occurrence of a default as in the
Mortgage provided.

                  This bond is subject to restrictions on transferability as set
forth in the Security Agreement.  This bond is transferable as prescribed in the
Mortgage by the  registered  owner

                                       10

<PAGE>

hereof in person, or by his duly authorized attorney, at the office or agency of
the Company in the Borough of Manhattan,  The City of New York,  upon  surrender
and cancellation of this bond, and thereupon, a new fully registered bond of the
same  series for a like  principal  amount will be issued to the  transferee  in
exchange  herefor as provided in the Mortgage.  The Company and the Trustees may
deem and treat the person in whose name this bond is  registered as the absolute
owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment and for all other purposes and
neither  the  Company  nor the  Trustees  shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

                  In the  manner  prescribed  in the  Mortgage,  bonds  of  this
series,  upon surrender  thereof for cancellation at the office or agency of the
Company in the Borough of Manhattan,  The City of New York, are exchangeable for
a like  aggregate  principal  amount  of  bonds  of the  same  series  of  other
authorized denominations.

                  No recourse  shall be had for the payment of the  principal of
this bond against any incorporator or any past,  present or future subscriber to
the capital stock,  stockholder,  officer,  or director of the Company or of any
predecessor or successor  corporation,  as such,  either directly or through the
Company or any  predecessor  of  successor  corporation,  under any rule of law,
statute or  constitution  or by the  enforcement of any assessment or otherwise,
all such liability of incorporators,  subscribers,  stockholders,  officers, and
directors being released by the holder or owner hereof by the acceptance of this
bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Mortgage.

                  This bond  shall not become  obligatory  until The Bank of New
York,  the Corporate  Trustee under the Mortgage,  or its successor  thereunder,
shall have signed the form of authentication certificate endorsed hereon.

                  IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  ALLETE,  Inc. has caused this bond to be
signed in its corporate  name by its President or one of its Vice  Presidents by
his signature or a facsimile thereof,  and its corporate seal to be impressed or

                               [End of Bond Form]



         (V)  At  the  option  of  the  registered   owner,  any  bonds  of  the
Twenty-eighth  Series,  upon surrender thereof for cancellation at the office or
agency  of the  Company  in the  Borough  of  Manhattan,  The City of New  York,
together with a written  instrument of transfer wherever required by the Company
duly executed by the registered owner or by his duly authorized attorney,  shall
(subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Mortgage) be exchangeable  for a
like aggregate  principal amount of bonds of the same series of other authorized
denominations.

         Bonds of the Twenty-eighth Series shall not be transferable except to a
successor  Agent  under the Credit  Agreement  or as  provided  in the  Security
Agreement, any such transfer to be made (subject to the provisions of Section 12
of the  Mortgage)  at the  office or agency of the  Company  in the  Borough  of
Manhattan, The City of New York.

         Upon any exchange or transfer of bonds of the Twenty-eighth Series, the
Company may make a charge  therefor  sufficient  to  reimburse it for any tax or
taxes or other  governmental  charge, as provided in Section 12 of the Mortgage,
but the Company hereby waives any right to make a charge in addition thereto for
any exchange or transfer of bonds of the Twenty-eighth Series.

         Upon the delivery of this Twenty-second Supplemental Indenture and upon
compliance  with the  applicable  provisions of the Mortgage,  there shall be an
initial issue of bonds of the Twenty-eighth  Series for the aggregate  principal
amount of $255,000,000.

                                       12

         (VI)  Prior to an event of  Foreclosure  (as  defined  in the  Security
Agreement) and transfer of bonds of the  Twenty-eighth  Series to a person other
than the Agent or to a successor  agent  appointed in accordance with the Credit
Agreement,  the  Company  shall  have no  obligation  as of any date to make any
payment of the principal of the bonds of the  Twenty-eighth  Series,  whether at
maturity, upon acceleration,  redemption or otherwise, in an amount in excess of
the  aggregate  Obligations  under and as defined in the Credit  Agreement  then
outstanding.

         In  the  event  of  a   Foreclosure   and  transfer  of  bonds  of  the
Twenty-eighth  Series to a person  other than the Agent or to a successor  agent
appointed in  accordance  with the Credit  Agreement,  the Agent shall  promptly
provide written notice to the Corporate Trustee of such event of Foreclosure and
the aggregate amount of Obligations under and as defined in the Credit Agreement
outstanding immediately prior to such Foreclosure.  With respect to bonds of the
Twenty-eighth Series sold or otherwise disposed of by reason of Foreclosure, the
Company shall have no obligation as of any date to pay any amount  thereunder in
excess of the aggregate amount of Obligations under and as defined in the Credit
Agreement outstanding immediately prior to such Foreclosure.

         For purposes of Section 29 of the  Mortgage,  any payments of principal
constituting  Obligations  under and as defined in the Credit  Agreement will be
deemed  to be a  retirement  of an equal  principal  amount  of the bonds of the
Twenty-eighth Series.

                                   ARTICLE II
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

hereby  further  amended by adding the words "and July 16, 2004" after the words

SECTION 1.3 ACCOUNTING TERMS AND DETERMINATIONS

Unless otherwise specified herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be
interpreted, all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made, and all
financial statements required to be delivered hereunder shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP; PROVIDED that in the event of any Accounting Practices
Change, then the Borrower's compliance with the Financial Covenants shall be
determined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in effect
immediately before giving effect to the Accounting Practices Change, until such
covenants are amended in a manner satisfactory to the Borrower and the Required
Lenders in accordance with Section 9.11.

                                   ARTICLE II
                     AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY

SECTION 2.1 TERM LOAN FACILITY.

On the Funding Date, each Lender shall make a single Advance to the Borrower in
a principal amount equal to that Lender's Commitment Amount. The Borrower's
obligation to pay the Advance made by each Lender shall be evidenced by the Note
payable to the order of that Lender. The Notes shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal amount thereof from the Funding Date until paid as set forth in
Section 2.2. At or before 2:00 p.m. on the Funding Date, each Lender shall
provide the Agent at the office of the Agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota with
immediately available funds equal to such Lender's Commitment Amount. The Agent
shall disburse the aggregate amount of the Advances by crediting the same to the
Borrower's demand deposit account maintained with the Agent or in such other
manner as the Agent and the Borrower may agree; provided, however, that the
Agent shall have no obligation to disburse the Advances if any condition set
forth in Article III has not been satisfied or if any Lender has failed to fund
its Commitment Amount. No portion of any Advance, once repaid, shall be
readvanced.

SECTION 2.2 INTEREST ON NOTES.

                  (a) FLOATING RATE FUNDINGS. Unless the Borrower elects a LIBO
     Rate pursuant to this Section, the principal balance of the Notes shall
     bear interest at the Floating Rate. The amount of the Floating Rate Funding
     shall be equal to at least $5,000,000, and the amount of the Floating Rate
     Funding over $5,000,000 shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000.

                  (b) LIBO RATE FUNDINGS. So long as no Default or Event of
     Default exists, the Borrower may convert all or any part of any outstanding
     Floating Rate Funding into a LIBO Rate Funding, or may request that a LIBO
     Rate Funding be converted at the end of the applicable Interest Period to
     another LIBO Rate Funding, by giving notice to the Agent of such request or
     conversion not later than 10:30 a.m. on a Business Day which is at least
     three Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion. Each
     such notice shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent, shall be in
     writing or by telephone or telecopy transmission, shall specify the date
     and amount of

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -11-

<PAGE>

     such conversion, and the Interest Period therefor. The Interest Period
     applicable to each LIBO Rate Funding shall begin on a Business Day, and the
     amount of each LIBO Rate Funding shall be equal to an integral multiple of
     $5,000,000. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the principal
     amount specified by the Borrower in the applicable request for a LIBO Rate
     Funding shall bear interest from and including the first day of the
     Interest Period specified therein to but not including the last day of such
     Interest Period, at the LIBO Rate applicable thereto, determined as set
     forth herein. Unless the Borrower requests a new LIBO Rate Funding in
     accordance with the procedures set forth above, or prepays the principal of
     an outstanding LIBO Rate Funding at the expiration of an Interest Period,
     the Lenders shall automatically and without request of the Borrower convert
     each LIBO Rate Funding to a Floating Rate Funding on the last day of the
     relevant Interest Period.

                  (c) SETTING OF LIBO RATES. The applicable LIBO Rate for each
     Interest Period shall be determined by the Agent between the opening of
     business and 12:00 noon on the second Business Day prior to the beginning
     of such Interest Period, whereupon notice thereof (which may be by
     telephone) shall be given by the Agent to the Borrower. Each such
     determination of the applicable LIBO Rate shall be conclusive and binding
     upon the parties hereto, in the absence of demonstrable error. The Agent,
     upon written request of the Borrower, shall deliver to the Borrower a
     statement showing the computations used by the Agent in determining the
     applicable LIBO Rate hereunder.

                  (d) LIMITATIONS ON LIBO RATE FUNDINGS. In no event shall more
     than six LIBO Rate Fundings be outstanding at any one time.

                  (e) INITIAL ADVANCE. Provided the Borrower makes its request
     to the Agent by not later than 9:00 a.m. on the Funding Date, the initial
     Advances may be funded as LIBO Rate Fundings. The applicable LIBO Rate for
     each Interest Period requested by the Borrower shall be determined by the
     Agent by 11:00 a.m. on the Funding Date, whereupon notice thereof (which
     may be by telephone) shall be given by the Agent to the Borrower. Such
     determination of the applicable LIBO Rate shall be conclusive and binding
     upon the parties hereto, in the absence of demonstrable error.

                  (f) DEFAULT RATE. From and after ten days after the occurrence
     of any Default or Event of Default and continuing thereafter until such
     Default or Event of Default shall be remedied to the written satisfaction
     of the Required Lenders, the outstanding principal balance of the Notes
     shall bear interest, until paid in full, at an annual rate equal to the sum
     of (i) the interest rate otherwise in effect with respect to each Funding
     and (ii) 200 basis points (2.00%) (the "Default Rate"). Calculation of
     interest at the Default Rate shall not be deemed a waiver or excuse of any
     such Default or Event of Default.

     herein, the Borrower from time to time may voluntarily prepay the Notes in

                      (iv) any  prepayment  of the full amount of any Note shall
                  include accrued interest thereon, and
                      (v)  each  partial  voluntary  prepayment  shall  be in an
                  aggregate amount equal to an integral multiple of $5,000,000.

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -13-

<PAGE>

                  shall be deemed to authorize or constitute consent to sales of
                  assets by the Borrower that otherwise would be prohibited or
                  restricted under this Agreement or under any other Loan
                  Document. For purposes of this clause (i), "Net Proceeds" from
                  an asset sale shall mean all proceeds of such sale after
                  payment of the following to the extent related to the sale or
                  the assets sold: debt, transaction costs and income taxes.
                      (ii) INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. In the event of an initial
                  public offering of the common stock of any of the Borrower's
                  Subsidiaries, the Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in an
                  amount equal to 100% of the Net Proceeds thereof within
                  fifteen (15) calendar days following receipt thereof. For
                  purposes of this clause (ii), "Net Proceeds" shall mean all
                  proceeds of such offering after payment of all related
                  transaction costs.
                      (iii) NEW CAPITAL. Within 15 calendar days following the
                  issuance of any debt by or equity interests in the Borrower or
                  any Subsidiary, the Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in
                  an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of such debt
                  instruments or equity interests. This clause shall not apply

                  issued to refinance existing indebtedness for the same amount
                  or common stock issued pursuant to the Borrower's or its
                  Subsidiaries' stock benefit plans, the Invest Direct Program,

                  thereof. Nothing in this clause (iii) shall be deemed to
                  authorize or constitute consent to the issuance of debt
                  instruments or equity interests by the Borrower that otherwise
                  would be prohibited or restricted under this Agreement or
                  under any other Loan Document.

                  (c) APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS. All prepayments hereunder
     (whether voluntary or mandatory) shall be applied first to accrued but
     unpaid interest on the Notes, ratably in accordance with the interest
     outstanding thereunder and then to the principal balance of the Notes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest on any LIBO Rate Funding prepaid
     hereunder and any compensation due under Section 2.10 on account of
     prepayment of a LIBO Rate Funding shall be paid with the same priority as
     the related principal prepayment.

SECTION 2.7 PAYMENTS.

                  (a) MAKING OF PAYMENTS. All payments of principal of and
     interest due under the Notes shall be made to the Agent at its office in
     Minneapolis, Minnesota, not later than 12:00 noon on the date due, in
     immediately available funds, and funds received after that hour shall be
     deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next following Business
     Day. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to charge the Borrower's
     demand deposit account maintained with the Agent for the amount of any such
     payment on its due date without receipt of any request for such charge, but

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -14-

<PAGE>

     the Lender's failure to so charge such account shall in no way affect the
     obligation of the Borrower to make any such payment.

                  (b) ASSUMED PAYMENTS. Unless the Agent has been notified by
     the Borrower prior to the date on which the Borrower is scheduled to make
     payment to the Agent of a payment to the Agent for the account of one or
     more of the Lenders hereunder (such payment being herein called a "Required
     Payment"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that it does not
     intend to make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may assume that
     the Required Payment has been made and may (but shall not be required to),
     in reliance upon such assumption, make the amount thereof available to the
     intended recipient on such date and, if the Borrower has not in fact made
     the Required Payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on
     demand, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with
     interest thereon for each day during the period commencing on the date such
     amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers
     such amount at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day.

                  (c) SETOFF. The Borrower agrees that each Lender shall have
     all rights of setoff and bankers' lien provided by applicable law, and in
     addition thereto, the Borrower agrees that if at any time any amount is due
     and owing by the Borrower under this Agreement to any Lender at a time when
     an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder, any Lender
     may apply any and all balances, credits, and deposits, accounts or moneys
     of the Borrower then or thereafter in the possession of that Lender
     (excluding, however, any trust or escrow accounts held by the Borrower for
     the benefit of any third party) to the payment thereof.

                  (d) DUE DATE EXTENSION. If any payment of principal of or
     interest on any Floating Rate Funding or any fees payable hereunder falls
     due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be
     extended to the next following Business Day, and (in the case of principal)
     additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the period of such
     extension.

                  (e) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. Except as otherwise provided
     herein, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing hereunder, each payment received from the Borrower shall be
     applied to such obligation as the Borrower shall specify by notice received
     by the Agent on or before the date of such payment, or in the absence of
     such notice, as the Required Lenders shall determine in their discretion.
     Except as otherwise provided herein, after the occurrence of a Default or
     Event of Default, the Lenders shall have the right to apply all payments
     received by the Lender from the Borrower as the Required Lenders may
     determine in their discretion. The Borrower agrees that the amount shown on
     the books and records of the Agent and the Lenders as being the principal
     balance of and interest on the Notes shall be conclusive absent
     demonstrable error.

SECTION 2.8 INCREASED COSTS; CAPITAL ADEQUACY; FUNDING EXCEPTIONS.

                  (a) INCREASED COSTS ON LIBO RATE FUNDINGS. If Regulation D of
     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or after the date of
     this Agreement the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or
     any change in any existing law, or any change in the interpretation or
     administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
     comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
     thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether
     or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
     comparable agency, shall:

                      (i) subject that Lender to or cause the withdrawal or
                  termination of any exemption previously granted to that Lender
                  with respect to, any tax, duty or other charge with respect to
                  its LIBO Rate Fundings or its obligation to make LIBO Rate
                  Fundings, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to
                  that Lender of the principal of or interest under this
                  Agreement in respect of its LIBO Rate Fundings or its
                  obligation to make LIBO Rate Fundings (except for changes in
                  the rate of taxes based on or measured by the net income of
                  that Lender (or franchise taxes in lieu thereof) and imposed
                  by the government or other authority of the country, state or
                  political subdivision in which that Lender is incorporated or
                  in which its principal executive office or the office through
                  which that Lender is acting is located); or

                      (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
                  (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the
                  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but
                  excluding any reserve included in the determination of
                  interest rates pursuant to Section 2.2), special deposit or
                  similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
                  the account of, or credit extended by, that Lender; or

                      (iii) impose on that Lender any other condition affecting
                  its making, maintaining or funding of its LIBO Rate Fundings
                  or its obligation to make LIBO Rate Fundings;

     and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to that
     Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Rate Funding, or to reduce the
     amount of any sum received or receivable by that Lender under this
     Agreement or under its Notes with respect to a LIBO Rate Funding, then that
     Lender will notify the Borrower of such increased cost and within fifteen
     (15) days after demand by that Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by
     a statement setting forth the basis of such demand and representing that
     that Lender has made similar demand on one or more other commercial
     borrowers with revolving or term loans in excess of $500,000) the Borrower
     shall pay to that Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
     compensate that Lender for such increased cost or such reduction; provided,
     however, that no such increased cost or such reduction shall be payable by
     the Borrower for any period longer than ninety (90) days prior to the date
     on which notice thereof is delivered to the Borrower. Each Lender will
     promptly notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge,


ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -16-

<PAGE>

     occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle that Lender to
     compensation pursuant to this Section 2.8. If the Borrower receives notice
     from any Lender of any event which will entitle that Lender to compensation
     pursuant to this Section 2.8, the Borrower may prepay any then outstanding
     LIBO Rate Fundings or notify that Lender that any pending request for a
     LIBO Rate Funding shall be deemed to be a request for a Floating Rate
     Funding, in each case subject to the provisions of Section 2.10.

                  (b) CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any Lender determines at any time
     that its Return has been reduced as a result of any Capital Adequacy Rule
     Change, that Lender may require the Borrower to pay it the amount necessary
     to restore that Lender's Return to what it would have been had there been
     no Capital Adequacy Rule Change. For purposes of this Section 2.8, the
     following definitions shall apply:

                      (i) "Return", for any calendar quarter or shorter period,
                  means the percentage determined by dividing (A) the sum of
                  interest and ongoing fees earned by any Lender under this
                  Agreement during such period by (B) the average capital that
                  Lender is required to maintain during such period as a result
                  of its being a party to this Agreement, as determined by that
                  Lender based upon its total capital requirements and a
                  reasonable attribution formula that takes account of the
                  Capital Adequacy Rules then in effect. Return may be
                  calculated for each calendar quarter and for the shorter
                  period between the end of a calendar quarter and the date of
                  termination in whole of this Agreement.

                      (ii) "Capital Adequacy Rule" means any law, rule,
                  regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy that
                  applies to any Lender, or the interpretation thereof by any
                  governmental or regulatory authority. Capital Adequacy Rules
                  include rules requiring financial institutions to maintain
                  total capital in amounts based upon percentages of outstanding
                  loans and binding loan commitments.

                      (iii) "Capital Adequacy Rule Change" means any change in
                  any Capital Adequacy Rule occurring after the date of this
                  Agreement, but does not include any changes in applicable
                  requirements that at the date hereof are scheduled to take
                  place under the existing Capital Adequacy Rules or any
                  increases in the capital that any Lender is required to
                  maintain to the extent that the increases are required due to
                  a regulatory authority's assessment of that Lender's financial
                  condition.

                      (iv) "Lender" includes (but is not limited to) the Agent,
                  the Lenders, as defined elsewhere in this Agreement, and any
                  assignee of any interest of any Lender hereunder and any
                  participant in the loans made hereunder.

     The initial notice sent by a Lender shall be sent as promptly as
     practicable after that Lender learns that its Return has been reduced,
     shall include a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore that
     Lender's Return for the quarter in which the notice is sent, shall state in
     reasonable detail the cause for the reduction in that Lender's Return and
     that Lender's calculation of the amount of such reduction, and


ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -17-

<PAGE>

     shall include that Lender's representation that it has made similar demand
     on one or more other commercial borrowers with revolving or term loans in
     excess of $500,000. Thereafter, that Lender may send a new notice during
     each calendar quarter setting forth the calculation of the reduced Return
     for that quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount necessary
     to restore that Lender's Return for that quarter. A Lender's calculation in
     any such notice shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error.

                  (c) BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR.
     If with respect to any Interest Period:

                      (i) any Lender determines that deposits in U.S. dollars
                  (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the
                  London interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period;
                  or

                      (ii) any Lender otherwise determines that by reason of
                  circumstances affecting the London interbank eurodollar market
                  adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
                  the applicable LIBO Rate; or

                      (iii) any Lender determines that the LIBO Rate as
                  determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect
                  the cost to that Lender of maintaining or funding a LIBO Rate
                  Funding for such Interest Period, or that the making or
                  funding of LIBO Rate Fundings has become impracticable as a
                  result of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement
                  which in the opinion of that Lender materially affects such
                  LIBO Rate Fundings;

     then that Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and (A) upon the
     occurrence of any event described in the foregoing clause (i) the Borrower
     shall enter into good faith negotiations with that Lender in order to
     determine an alternate method to determine the LIBO Rate for that Lender,
     and during the pendency of such negotiations with that Lender, the Lenders
     shall be under no obligation to make any new LIBO Rate Fundings, and (B)
     upon the occurrence of any event described in the foregoing clauses (ii) or
     (iii), for so long as such circumstances shall continue, the Lenders shall
     be under no obligation to make any new LIBO Rate Fundings.

                  (d) ILLEGALITY. If any change in (including the adoption of
     any new) applicable laws or regulations, or any change in the
     interpretation of applicable laws or regulations by any governmental
     authority, central bank, comparable agency or any other regulatory body
     charged with the interpretation, implementation or administration thereof,
     or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not
     having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank, comparable
     agency or other regulatory body, should make it or, in the good faith
     judgment of that Lender, shall raise a substantial question as to whether
     it is unlawful for that Lender to make, maintain or fund LIBO Rate
     Fundings, then (i) that Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
     Agent, (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, maintain or convert into
     LIBO Rate Fundings shall, upon the effectiveness of such event, be
     suspended for the duration of such unlawfulness, and (iii) for the


ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -18-

<PAGE>

     duration of such unlawfulness, any notice by the Borrower requesting the
     Lenders to make or convert into LIBO Rate Fundings shall be construed as a
     request to make or to continue making Floating Rate Fundings.

SECTION 2.9  TAXES.

                  (a) All payments made by the Borrower to the Agent or any
     Lender (herein any "Payee") under or in connection with this Agreement or
     the Notes shall be made without any setoff or other counterclaim, and free
     and clear of and without deduction for or on account of any present or
     future Taxes now or hereafter imposed by any governmental or other
     authority, except to the extent that such deduction or withholding is
     compelled by law. As used herein, the term "Taxes" shall include all
     income, excise and other taxes of whatever nature (other than taxes based
     on or measured by the net income of the Payee (or franchise taxes in lieu
     thereof) and imposed by the government or other authority of the country,
     state or political subdivision in which such Payee is incorporated or in
     which its principal executive office or the office through which the Payee
     is acting is located ("Excluded Taxes")) as well as all levies, imposts,
     duties, charges, or fees of whatever nature. If the Borrower is compelled
     by law to make any such deductions or withholdings it will:

                      (i) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount
                  required to be so withheld or deducted;

                      (ii) except to the extent that such deduction or
                  withholding results from a breach by any Payee of the
                  representations and covenants contained in Section 2.9(b) or
                  the relevant Assignment Certificate, pay such additional
                  amounts (including, without limitation, any penalties,
                  interest or expenses) as may be necessary in order that the
                  net amount received by each Payee after such deductions or
                  withholdings (including any required deduction or withholding
                  on such additional amounts) shall equal the amount such Payee
                  would have received had no such deductions or withholdings
                  been made; and

                      (iii) promptly forward to the Agent (for delivery to such
                  Payee) an official receipt or other documentation reasonably
                  satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such
                  authorities.

                  (b) If any Taxes otherwise payable by the Borrower pursuant to
     Section 2.9(a) are directly asserted against any Payee, such Payee may pay
     such Taxes and the Borrower promptly shall reimburse such Payee to the full
     extent otherwise required by such Section. The obligations of the Borrower
     under this Section 2.9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
     Each Lender by its execution of this Agreement represents (and each
     Additional Lender by its execution of any Assignment Certificate pursuant
     to Section 8.10 shall be deemed to represent) to each other Lender, the
     Agent and the Borrower that if such Lender or Additional Lender is
     organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States
     or any state thereof, such Lender or Additional Lender has furnished to the
     Agent and the Borrower either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or
     U.S. Internal

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -19-

<PAGE>

     Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, as applicable (wherein such Lender claims
     entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on all
     interest payments hereunder).

                  (c) The amount that the Borrower shall be required to pay to
     any Lender pursuant to Section 2.9(a) or 2.9(b) shall be reduced by the
     amount of any offsetting tax benefit which such Lender receives as a result
     of the Borrower's payment to the relevant authorities as reasonably
     determined by such Lender; provided, however, that (i) such Lender shall be
     the sole judge of the amount of such tax benefit and the date on which it
     is received, (ii) no Lender shall be obliged to disclose information
     regarding its tax affairs or tax computations, (iii) nothing herein shall
     interfere with a Lender's right to manage its tax affairs in whatever
     manner it sees fit, and (iv) if such Lender shall subsequently determine
     that it has lost the benefit of all or a portion of such tax benefit, the
     Borrower shall promptly remit to such Lender the amount certified by such
     Lender to be the amount necessary to restore such Lender to the position it
     would have been in if no payment had been made pursuant to this Section
     2.9(c).

                  (d) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other
     governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any
     political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent or the
     Borrower did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the
     account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or
     properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Agent or the
     Borrower of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from
     withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall
     indemnify the Agent or the Borrower, as applicable, fully for all amounts
     paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent or the Borrower, as applicable,
     as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and
     interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
     payable to the Agent or the Borrower, as applicable, under this subsection,
     together with all costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys
     fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent or the Borrower, as
     applicable, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or the Borrower,
     as applicable). The obligations of each Lender under this Section 2.9(d)
     shall survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this
     Agreement.

SECTION 2.10 FUNDING LOSSES.

Upon demand by any Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement
setting forth the basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed), the
Borrower shall indemnify that Lender against any loss or expense which that
Lender may have sustained or incurred (including, without limitation, any net
loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by that Lender to fund or maintain LIBO Rate
Fundings) or which that Lender may be deemed to have sustained or incurred, as
reasonably determined by that Lender, (i) as a consequence of any failure by the
Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection
with

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -20-

<PAGE>

any LIBO Rate Fundings, (ii) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow or
convert any LIBO Rate Fundings on a date specified therefor in a notice thereof
or (iii) due to any payment or prepayment of any LIBO Rate Funding on a date
other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period for such LIBO Rate
Funding. For this purpose, all notices under Section 2.2(b) shall be deemed to
be irrevocable.

SECTION 2.11 DISCRETION OF LENDERS AS TO MANNER OF FUNDING.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender
shall be entitled to fund and maintain all or any part of its LIBO Rate Fundings
in any manner it deems fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes
of this Agreement (specifically including, without limitation, Section 2.10
hereof) all determinations hereunder shall be made as if that Lender had
actually funded and maintained each LIBO Rate Funding during each Interest
Period for such LIBO Rate Funding through the purchase of deposits having a
maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate
equal to the appropriate LIBO Rate for such Interest Period.

SECTION 2.12 CONCLUSIVENESS OF STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS.

Determinations and statements of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8 and 2.10
shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Borrower shall have no right to review any records of any
Lender or its other customers to determine the accuracy of any statement by that
Lender under Section 2.8(a) or 2.8(b) regarding that Lender's demands upon other
customers of that Lender. Each Lender may use reasonable averaging and
attribution methods in determining compensation pursuant to such Sections 2.8
and 2.10 and the provisions of Sections 2.8 and 2.10 shall survive termination
of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.13 USE OF PROCEEDS.

The Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Advances to satisfy its obligations
with respect to the Refinanced Bonds.

SECTION 2.14  COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

All interest determined at the Floating Rate will be calculated based on the
actual days elapsed in a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. All
interest determined at the LIBO Rate and all fees hereunder shall be computed on
the basis of actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

                  (k) The rendering against the Borrower of a final judgment,
     decree or order for the payment of money in excess of $5,000,000 and the
     continuance of such judgment, decree or order unsatisfied and in effect for
     any period of 30 consecutive days without a stay of execution.

                  (l) A writ of attachment, garnishment, levy or similar process
     shall be issued against or served upon the Agent with respect to (i) any
     property of the Borrower in the possession of the Agent, or (ii) any
     indebtedness of any Lender to the Borrower.

                  (m) Any Plan shall have been terminated, or a trustee shall
     have been appointed by an appropriate United States District Court to
     administer any Plan, or the PBGC shall have instituted proceedings to
     terminate any Plan or to appoint a

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -35-

<PAGE>

     trustee to administer any Plan, or withdrawal liability shall have been
     asserted against the Borrower, any Material Subsidiary or any ERISA
     Affiliate by a Multiemployer Plan; or the Borrower, any Material Subsidiary
     or any ERISA Affiliate shall have incurred liability to PBGC (other than
     for premiums due for the current premium period under Section 4007 of
     ERISA), the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor or Plan
     participants (other than for benefit claims in the normal course) with
     respect to any Plan; or any ERISA Event that the Required Lenders may
     determine in good faith could reasonably be expected to constitute grounds
     for the termination of any Plan, for the appointment by the appropriate
     United States District Court of a trustee to administer any Plan or for the
     imposition of withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan,
     shall have occurred and be continuing 30 days after written notice to such
     effect shall have been given to the Borrower by the Lenders, but only if in
     each case, the event could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
     Adverse Effect on the Borrower, any Material Subsidiary or an ERISA
     Affiliate.

SECTION 7.2  RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter until such
Event of Default is cured to the written satisfaction of the Required Lenders,
the Agent may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, and shall, at the
request of the Required Lenders, exercise any or all of the following rights and
remedies:

                  (a) The Agent may, by notice to the Borrower, declare the
     Obligations to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Obligations
     shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand,
     protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
     waived by the Borrower.

                  (b) The Lenders may, without notice to the Borrower and
     without further action, apply any and all money owing by any Lender to the
     Borrower to the payment of the Obligations. For purposes of this subsection
     (b), "Lender" means the Lenders, as defined elsewhere in this Agreement,
     and any participant in the Advances; provided, however, that each such
     participant, by exercising its rights under this subsection (b), agrees
     that it shall be obligated under Section 8.4 with respect to such payment
     as if it were a Lender for purposes of that Section.

                  (c) The Agent may exercise and enforce its rights and remedies
     under the Pledge Agreement.

                  (d) The Lenders may exercise any other rights and remedies
     available to them by law or agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
described in Section 7.1(h) or (i) hereof, the Obligations shall be immediately
due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind.

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -36-

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                    THE AGENT

SECTION 8.1  AUTHORIZATION.

Each Lender and the holder of each Note irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Agent to act on behalf of such Lender or holder to the extent provided herein or
in any document or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, and
to take such other action as may be reasonably incidental thereto.

SECTION 8.2  DISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS AND PROCEEDS.

                  (a) After deduction of any costs of collection as hereinafter
     provided, the Agent shall remit to each Lender that Lender's Percentage of
     all payments of principal, interest and fees that are received by the Agent
     under the Loan Documents. Each Lender's interest in the Loan Documents
     shall be payable solely from payments, collections and proceeds actually
     received by the Agent under the Loan Documents; and the Agent's only
     liability to the Lenders hereunder shall be to account for each Lender's
     Percentage of such payments, collections and proceeds in accordance with
     this Agreement. If the Agent is ever required for any reason to refund any
     such payments, collections or proceeds, each Lender will refund to the
     Agent, upon demand, its Percentage of such payments, collections or
     proceeds, together with its Percentage of interest or penalties, if any,
     payable by the Agent in connection with such refund. The Agent may, in its
     sole discretion, make payment to the Lenders in anticipation of receipt of
     payment from the Borrower. If the Agent fails to receive any such
     anticipated payment from the Borrower, each Lender shall promptly refund to
     the Agent, upon demand, any such payment made to it in anticipation of
     payment from the Borrower, together with interest for each day on such
     amount until so refunded at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for each
     such date.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Lender has
     wrongfully refused to fund its Percentage of any Advance as required
     hereunder, or if the principal balance of any Lender's Note is for any
     other reason less than its Percentage of the aggregate principal balances
     of the Notes then outstanding, the Agent may remit all payments received by
     it to the other Lenders until such payments have reduced the aggregate
     amounts owed by the Borrower to the extent that the aggregate amount owing
     to such Lender hereunder is equal to its Percentage of the aggregate amount
     owing to all of the Lenders hereunder. The provisions of this subsection
     are intended only to set forth certain rules for the application of
     payments, proceeds and collections in the event that a Lender has breached
     its obligations hereunder and shall not be deemed to excuse any Lender from
     such obligations.

SECTION 8.3  EXPENSES.

All payments, collections and proceeds received or effected by the Agent may be
applied, first, to pay or reimburse the Agent for all costs, expenses, damages
and liabilities at any

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -37-

<PAGE>

time incurred by or imposed upon the Agent in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document (including but not limited to all reasonable attorney's
fees, foreclosure expenses and advances made to protect the security of
collateral, if any, but excluding any costs, expenses, damages or liabilities
arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent). If the
Agent does not receive payments, collections or proceeds from the Borrower or
its properties sufficient to cover any such costs, expenses, damages or
liabilities within 30 days after their incurrence or imposition, each Lender
shall, upon demand, remit to the Agent its Percentage of the difference between
(i) such costs, expenses, damages and liabilities, and (ii) such payments,
collections and proceeds.

SECTION 8.4  PAYMENTS RECEIVED DIRECTLY BY LENDERS.

If any Lender or other holder of a Note shall obtain any payment or other
recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise)
on account of principal of or interest on any Note other than through
distributions made in accordance with Section 8.2, such Lender or holder shall
promptly give notice of such fact to the Agent and shall purchase from the other
Lenders or holders such participations in the Notes held by them as shall be
necessary to cause the purchasing Lender or holder to share the excess payment
or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or
any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from
such purchasing Lender or holder, the purchase shall be rescinded and the
purchasing Lender restored to the extent of such recovery (but without interest
thereon).

SECTION 8.5  INDEMNIFICATION.

The Agent shall not be required to do any act hereunder or under any other
document or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, or to
prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement or the Notes or any
documents or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith unless
indemnified to its satisfaction by the holders of the Notes against loss, cost,
liability and expense (other than any such loss, cost, liability or expense
attributable to the Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct). If any
indemnity furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the
Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for additional
indemnity and not commence or cease to do the acts indemnified against until
such additional indemnity is furnished.

SECTION 8.6  EXCULPATION.

                  (a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel
     concerning legal matters, and upon this Agreement, any Loan Document and
     any schedule, certificate, statement, report, notice or other writing which
     it in good faith believes to be genuine or to have been presented by a
     proper person. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
     employees or agents shall (i) be responsible for any recitals,
     representations or warranties contained in, or for the execution, validity,
     genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of this Agreement, any Loan
     Document, or any other instrument or document delivered hereunder or in
     connection herewith, (ii) be

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -38-

<PAGE>

     responsible for the validity, genuineness, perfection, effectiveness,
     enforceability, existence, value or enforcement of any collateral security,
     (iii) be under any duty to inquire into or pass upon any of the foregoing
     matters, or to make any inquiry concerning the performance by the Borrower
     or any other obligor of its obligations, or (iv) in any event, be liable as
     such for any action taken or omitted by it or them, except for its or their
     own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The appointment of Wells Fargo
     as Agent hereunder shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and
     powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, Wells Fargo in its
     individual capacity.

                  (b) The term, "agent", is used herein in reference to the
     Agent merely as a matter of custom. It is intended to reflect only an
     administrative relationship between the Agent and the Lenders, in each case
     as independent contracting parties. However, the obligations of the Agent
     shall be limited to those expressly set forth herein. In no event shall the
     use of such term create or imply any fiduciary relationship or any other
     obligation arising under the general law of agency, and no implied
     covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
     shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise
     exist against the Agent.

SECTION 8.7  AGENT AND AFFILIATES.

The Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder in its individual
capacity as any other Lender, and may exercise or refrain from exercising the
same as though it were not the Agent, and the Agent and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Borrower as fully as if the Agent were not the Agent hereunder.

SECTION 8.8  CREDIT INVESTIGATION.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has made its own independent credit decision
and investigation and taken such care on its own behalf as would have been the
case had the Advances been made directly by such Lender to the Borrower without
the intervention of the Agent or any other Lender. Each Lender agrees and
acknowledges that the Agent makes no representations or warranties about the
creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other party to this Agreement or with
respect to the legality, validity, sufficiency or enforceability of this
Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other instrument or document delivered
hereunder or in connection herewith.

SECTION 8.9  RESIGNATION.

The Agent may resign as such at any time upon at least 30 days' prior notice to
the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any resignation of the Agent, the
Required Lenders shall as promptly as practicable appoint a Lender as a
successor Agent; provided, however, that so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, no such successor Agent may
be appointed without the prior written consent of the Borrower. If no such
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Agent's giving
of notice of

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -39-

<PAGE>

resignation, then the resigning Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
Lender as a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under
the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon be entitled to receive from the prior Agent such
documents of transfer and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably
request and the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement. After any resignation pursuant to this
Section, the provisions of this Section shall inure to the benefit of the
retiring Agent as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
an Agent hereunder.

SECTION 8.10  ASSIGNMENTS.

                  (a) Any Lender may, at any time, assign a portion of its Notes
     to an Eligible Lender (an "Applicant") on any date (the "Adjustment Date")
     selected by such Lender, subject to the terms and provisions of this
     Section 8.10. The aggregate principal amount of the Note so assigned in any
     assignment shall be not less than $5,000,000, and the assigning Lender
     shall retain at least $5,000,000 of such Note for its own account;
     provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to a
     Lender assigning its entire Note to the Applicant. Any Lender proposing an
     assignment hereunder shall give notice of such assignment to the Agent and
     the Borrower at least ten Business Days prior to such assignment (unless
     the Agent consents to a shorter period of time). Such notice shall specify
     the identity of such Applicant and the Percentage which it proposes that
     such Applicant acquire. Any assignment hereunder may be made only with the
     prior written consent of the Agent and the Borrower; provided, however,
     that (i) in no event shall such consent be unreasonably withheld, and (ii)
     the consent of the Borrower shall not be required if a Default or Event of
     Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment.

                  (b) Subject to the prior written consent of the Agent and the
     Borrower (if applicable), to confirm the status of an Applicant as a party
     to this Agreement and to evidence the assignment of the applicable portion
     of the assigning Lender's Note in accordance herewith:

                      (i) the Borrower, such Lender, such Applicant, and the
                  Agent shall, on or before the Adjustment Date, execute and
                  deliver to the Agent an Assignment Certificate (provided that,
                  if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
                  continuing on the applicable Adjustment Date, the assignment
                  will be effective whether the Borrower signs it or not), in
                  substantially the form of Exhibit D (an "Assignment
                  Certificate"); and

                      (ii) the Borrower will, at its own expense and in exchange
                  for the assigning Lender's Note, execute and deliver to the
                  assigning Lender a new Note, payable to the order of the
                  Applicant in an amount corresponding to the applicable
                  interest in the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
                  acquired by such Applicant pursuant to such assignment, and,
                  if the assigning Lender has

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -40-

<PAGE>

                  retained interests in such rights and obligations, a new Note,
                  payable to the order of that Lender in an amount corresponding
                  to such retained interests. Such new Notes shall be in an
                  aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of
                  the Note to be replaced by such new Notes, shall be dated the
                  effective date of such assignment and shall otherwise be in
                  the form of the Note to be replaced thereby. Such new Notes
                  shall be issued in substitution for, but not in satisfaction
                  or payment of, the Note being replaced thereby.

     Upon the execution and delivery of such Assignment Certificate and such
     Notes, (A) this Agreement shall deemed to be amended to the extent, and
     only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Additional
     Lender and the resulting adjustment of Percentages arising therefrom, (B)
     the assigning Lender shall be relieved of all obligations hereunder to the
     extent of the reduction of all obligations hereunder and to the extent of
     the reduction of such Lender's Percentage, and (C) the Additional Lender
     shall become a party hereto and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits
     and privileges accorded to a Lender herein and in each other document or
     instrument executed pursuant hereto and subject to all obligations of a
     Lender hereunder, including the right to approve or disapprove actions
     which, in accordance with the terms hereof, require the approval of the
     Required Lenders or all Lenders, and the obligations to make Advances
     hereunder.

                  (c) In order to facilitate the addition of Additional  Lenders
     hereto,  the  Borrower  shall  (subject  to the  written  agreement  of any
     prospective   Additional  Lender  to  be  subject  to  the  confidentiality
     provisions of Section 8.13) provide all reasonable  assistance requested by
     each Lender and the Agent relating  thereto,  which shall not require undue
     effort  or  expense  on  the  part  of  the  Borrower,  including,  without
     limitation,   the  furnishing  of  such  written  materials  and  financial
     information  regarding  the  Borrower  as  any  Lender  or  the  Agent  may
     reasonably request,  and the participation by officers of the Borrower in a
     meeting  or  teleconference  call with any  Applicant  upon the  reasonable
     request upon reasonable notice of any Lender or the Agent.

                  (d) Without limiting any other provision hereof:

                      (i) each Lender shall have the right at any time upon
                  written notice to the Borrower and the Agent (but without
                  requiring the consent of the Borrower or the Agent) to sell,
                  assign, transfer, or negotiate all or any part of its Notes,
                  and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
                  Loan Documents to one or more Affiliates of such Lender,
                  provided that, unless consented to by the Borrower and the
                  Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), no
                  such sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation shall relieve
                  the transferring Lender from its obligations (to the extent
                  such Affiliate does not fulfill its obligations) hereunder;
                  and

                      (ii) each Lender shall have the right at any time upon
                  written notice to the Borrower and the Agent (but without
                  requiring the consent of the

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -41-

<PAGE>

                  Borrower or the Agent) to sell, assign, transfer, or negotiate
                  all or any part of its Notes, and other rights and obligations
                  under this Agreement and the Loan Documents to one or more
                  Lenders, and any such sale, assignment, transfer or
                  negotiation shall relieve the transferring Lender from its
                  obligations hereunder to the extent of the obligations so
                  transferred (except, in any event, to the extent that the
                  Borrower, any other Lender or the Agent has rights against
                  such transferring Lender as a result of any default by such
                  transferring Lender under this Agreement).

                  (e) Simultaneous with any assignment under this Section, the
     Lender making such assignment shall pay the Agent a transfer fee in the
     amount of $3,500.

                  (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
     any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding
     vehicle (an "SPC") of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing
     from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Agent and the Borrower, the
     option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Advance that such
     Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower
     pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall
     constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Advance, (ii) if an SPC
     elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any
     part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such
     Advance pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) such Granting Lender's other
     obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (iv) such Granting
     Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
     performance of such obligations, and (v) the Borrower, the Agent and the
     other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Granting
     Lender in connection with such Granting Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement (including any rights and obligations assigned to such
     SPC). Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any
     indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability
     for which shall remain with the applicable Granting Lender). All notices
     hereunder to any Granting Lender or the related SPC, and all payments in
     respect of the Obligations due to such Granting Lender or the related SPC,
     shall be made to such Granting Lender. In addition, each Granting Lender
     shall vote as a Lender hereunder without giving effect to any assignment
     under this subsection (f), and no SPC shall have any vote as a Lender under
     this Agreement for any purpose. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
     hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
     Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
     payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will
     not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against,
     such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
     liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State
     thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
     this Section 8.10, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior
     written consent of, the Borrower or the Agent and without paying any
     transfer fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in its
     right to repayment of any Advances to its Granting Lender or to any
     financial institutions providing liquidity

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -42-

<PAGE>

     and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to fund the
     Advances made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by
     such SPC to fund such Advances and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis,
     to the extent such disclosure would be permitted under Section 8.13 as if
     such SPC were a Lender, any non-public information relating to its Advances
     to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
     guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. No amendment to
     this subsection (f) that affects the rights of an SPC that has made an
     advance hereunder shall be effective without the consent of such SPC.

                  (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
     Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
     its rights under this Agreement and that Lender's Note in favor of any
     Federal Reserve Lender in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of
     Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

SECTION 8.11  PARTICIPATIONS

Each Lender may grant participations in a portion of its Notes to any Eligible
Lender, upon prior written notice to the Agent but without the consent of the
Agent or the Borrower, but only so long as the principal amount of the
participation so granted is no less than $5,000,000 (or, if the participant is a
Participating Affiliate, no less than $1,000,000). No holder of any such
participation, other than an Affiliate of such Lender, shall be entitled to
require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder, except that
such Lender may agree with such participant that such Lender will not, without
such participant's consent, agree to any action described in Section 9.2(a). No
Lender shall, as between the Borrower and such Lender, be relieved of any of its
obligations hereunder as a result of any such granting of a participation. The
Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that any participant described in this
Section will, for purposes of Sections 2.8 and 2.9 only, be considered to be a
Lender hereunder (provided that such participant shall not be entitled to
receive any more than the Lender selling such participation would have received
had such sale not taken place).

SECTION 8.12 LIMITATION ON ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

Except as set forth in Sections 8.10 and 8.11, no Lender may assign any of its
rights or obligations under, or grant any participation in, any Loan Document.

SECTION 8.13  DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.

                  (a) The Agent and the Lenders shall keep confidential (and
     cause their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
     representatives to keep confidential) all information, materials and
     documents furnished by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to the Agent or
     the Lenders (the "Disclosed Information"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

     the Agent; (v) to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations or
     by any subpoena or similar legal process, or requested by any governmental
     agency or authority, provided that Agent or Lender provides Borrower with
     prompt written notice of such proceeding so that Borrower may seek a
     protective order or other appropriate remedy; (vi) to the extent such
     Disclosed Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result
     of a breach of this Agreement, (B) becomes available to the Agent or such
     Lender on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or
     a Subsidiary, or (C) can be shown by Agent or Lender to have been available
     to the Agent or such Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to its
     disclosure to the Agent or such Lender by the Borrower or a Subsidiary;
     (vii) to the extent the Borrower or such Subsidiary shall have consented to
     such disclosure in writing; (viii) to the extent reasonably deemed
     necessary by the Agent or any Lender in the enforcement of the remedies of
     the Agent and the Lenders provided under the Loan Documents; or (ix) in
     connection with any potential assignment or participation in the interest
     granted hereunder, provided that any such potential assignee or participant

     on the Agent and the Lenders under this Section 8.13.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
     information subject to this Section 8.13 shall not include, and the Agent
     and each Lender may disclose without limitation of any kind, any
     information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in
     each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of
     the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind
     (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Agent
     or such Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided
     that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case
     contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the
     transaction as well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to
     such portions of the document or similar item that relate to the tax
     treatment or tax structure of the Notes and transactions contemplated
     hereby. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries may also disclose without
     limitation the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" of the transactions
     contemplated hereby.

SECTION 8.14 AGENT NOT OFFERING BONDS.

Each Lender acknowledges that neither the Agent's taking possession of the
Bonds, nor its exercise of remedies with respect to the Bonds and subsequent
distribution of proceeds thereunder, constitutes or will constitute an offer of
any security, a solicitation of an offer to buy any security, or a placement of
any security.

SECTION 9.1  NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.

No failure or delay on the part of the Lenders in exercising any right, power or
remedy under the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
Lender's acceptance of payments while any Default or Event of Default is
outstanding operate as a waiver of such Default or Event of Default, or any
right, power or remedy under the Loan Documents; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy under the
Loan Documents. The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

SECTION 9.2  AMENDMENTS, ETC.

No amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be

or at the request of the Required Lenders), and any such waiver shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

                  (a) No such amendment or waiver shall be effective to do any

                  the Maturity Date.

                      (ii) Permit the Borrower to assign its rights under this
                  Agreement.

                      (iii) Amend this Section, the definition of "Required
                  Lenders" in Section 1.1, or any provision herein providing for
                  consent or other action by all Lenders.

                      (iv) Forgive any indebtedness of the Borrower arising
                  under this Agreement or the Notes, or reduce the rate of
                  interest or any fees charged under this Agreement or the
                  Notes.

                      (v) Postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or
                  any other Loan Document for any payment of principal,
                  interest, facility fees or other material amounts due to the
                  Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan
                  Document.

                      (vi) Release the Agent's security interest in any Bonds or
                  other collateral granted under the Pledge Agreement (other
                  than in accordance with the Pledge Agreement) or amend any
                  terms of any Bonds.

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -45-

<PAGE>

                  (b) No amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or
     duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless
     in writing and signed by the Agent.

                  (c) No amendment, modification or (except as provided
     elsewhere herein) termination of this Agreement or waiver of any rights of
     the Borrower or obligations of any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall be
     effective unless the Borrower shall have consented thereto in writing.

No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to
any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

SECTION 9.3  NOTICE.

delivered hereunder and thereunder, and (ii) all costs and expenses incurred by
the Agent or any Lender in connection with the workout or enforcement of the
Loan Documents and the other instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder
and thereunder; including, in each case, reasonable fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of outside counsel with respect thereto.

SECTION 9.5 INDEMNIFICATION BY BORROWER.

The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and the Lenders and each
officer, director, employee and agent thereof (herein individually each called
an "Indemnitee" and collectively called the "Indemnitees") from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, reasonable expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) and liabilities (all of the foregoing
being herein called the "Indemnified Liabilities") incurred by an Indemnitee in
connection with or arising out of the execution or delivery of this Agreement or
any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
hereto

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -46-

<PAGE>

of their respective obligations hereunder or the use of the proceeds of
any Advance hereunder (including but not limited to any such loss, claim,
damage, expense or liability arising out of any claim that any Environmental Law
has been breached with respect to any activity or property of the Borrower),
except for any portion of such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities
incurred solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
applicable Indemnitee. If and to the extent that the foregoing indemnity may be
unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified
Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. All obligations provided
for in this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.6  EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.

This Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which counterparts of this Agreement or such other Loan
Document, as the case may be, taken together, shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.

SECTION 9.7  BINDING EFFECT, ASSIGNMENT.

The Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except
that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights thereunder or
any interest therein without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders.

SECTION 9.8  GOVERNING LAW.

The Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Minnesota.

SECTION 9.9  SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS.

Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof.

SECTION 9.10 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.

Each party irrevocably (i) agrees that any suit, action or other legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document may be brought in a court of record in Hennepin County in the State of
Minnesota or in the courts of the United States located in such State, (ii)
consents to the jurisdiction of each such court in any suit, action or
proceeding, (iii) waives any objection which it may have to the laying of venue
of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such courts and any claim that any
such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and
(iv) agrees that a final judgment

ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT               -47-

<PAGE>

in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by law.

SECTION 9.11 RECALCULATION OF COVENANTS FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING PRACTICES CHANGE.

The Borrower shall notify the Agent of any Accounting Practices Change promptly

to the Financial Covenants necessary to reflect the effects of such Accounting
Practices Change.

SECTION 9.12  HEADINGS.

Article and Section headings in this Agreement are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement
for any other purpose.

SECTION 9.13 TITLES.

The Person identified on the title page as "Syndication Agent" shall have no
right, power, obligation or liability under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document on account of such identification other than those applicable to such
Person in its capacity (if any) as a Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has not relied, and will not rely, on any Person so identified in deciding to
enter into this Agreement or in taking or omitting any action hereunder.

SECTION 9.14  NONLIABILITY OF LENDERS.

The relationship between the Borrower on the one hand and the Lenders and the
Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the
Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower.
Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower
to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of
the Borrower's business or operations. The Borrower agrees that neither the
Agent nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether sounding in
tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in connection
with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated
and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or
event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which
recovery is sought. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability
with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue
for, any special, indirect or consequential damages suffered by the Borrower in
connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan Documents or
the transactions contemplated thereby.

                  This is a Compliance Certificate submitted in connection with
the Borrower's financial statements (the "Statements") as of
                             (the "Effective Date").
- -------------------, -------

                  I hereby certify to you as follows:

         1.       I am the                       of the Borrower, and I am
                           ---------------------
                  familiar with the financial statements and financial affairs
                  of the Borrower.

                  consistent with, the Statements.

         4.       I have no knowledge of the occurrence of any Default or Event
                  of Default under the Credit Agreement, except as set forth in
                  the attachments, if any, hereto.

Agreement, the Lenders severally, to the extent of their respective Commitments,

                  For purposes of the  foregoing,  (a) if either  Moody's or S&P
shall not have in effect a rating  for the Index Debt  (other  than by reason of
the  circumstances  referred to in the last sentence of this  definition),  then
such rating  agency shall be deemed to have  established a rating in Category 5;
(b) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and
S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within  different  Categories,  the Applicable
Margin  shall be based on the higher of the two ratings;  PROVIDED,  that if the
difference in such ratings is more than two  Categories,  then the Category that
is one Category  below the highest  rating  shall apply;  and (c) if the ratings
established or deemed to have been  established by Moody's and S&P for the Index
Debt shall be changed  (other than as a result of a change in the rating  system
of Moody's or S&P),  such change shall be effective as of the earlier of (i) the
date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency and (ii) the
date on which ADESA gives notice of such change to the Administrative Agent. For
the  purposes  hereof,  ADESA  and  ALLETE  shall  be  required  to  notify  the
Administrative  Agent of such change  immediately upon gaining knowledge of such
change.  Each change in the  Applicable  Margin  shall  apply  during the period
commencing  on the  effective  date  of  such  change  and  ending  on the  date
immediately  preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating
system of Moody's or S&P shall  change,  or if either such rating  agency  shall
cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, ADESA, ALLETE,
the Lenders and the Administrative  Agent shall negotiate in good faith to amend
this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the  unavailability  of
ratings  from such rating  agency and,  pending  the  effectiveness  of any such
amendment,  the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating
most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

                  "ASSIGNMENT  AND  ACCEPTANCE"  shall  mean an  assignment  and
acceptance  entered  into by a Lender and an  assignee  (with the consent of any
party  whose  consent  is  required  by SECTION  10.4(b))  and  accepted  by the
Administrative Agent, in the form of EXHIBIT B attached hereto or any other form
approved by the Administrative Agent.

                  "BASE RATE" shall mean (with any change in the Base Rate to be
effective as of the date of change of either of the following  rates) the higher
of (a) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly announces from
time to time as its prime lending rate, as in effect from time to time,  and (b)
the Federal  Funds Rate,  as in effect from time to time,  plus  one-half of one
percent (0.50%) per annum.  The  Administrative  Agent's prime lending rate is a
reference  rate and does not  necessarily  represent  the  lowest  or best  rate
actually  charged to customers.  The  Administrative  Agent may make  commercial
loans or other loans at rates of interest at, above or below the  Administrative
Agent's  prime  lending rate.  Each change in the  Administrative  Agent's prime
lending  rate shall be  effective  from and  including  the date such  change is
publicly announced as being effective.

                  "BASE RATE LOAN" shall mean the Term Loan of a Lender  bearing
interest at the Base Rate.

                  "BORROWER"   shall  have  the  meaning  in  the   introductory
paragraph  hereof,  and shall  include its legal  representatives  and permitted
successors and assigns.

                  "BUSINESS  DAY" shall mean (a) any day other than a  Saturday,
Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in Atlanta, Georgia are authorized
or  required  by law to  close  and (b) if such  day  relates  to a  payment  or
prepayment  of principal or interest on, a conversion of or into, or an Interest
Period for, a LIBOR Loan or a notice with respect to any of the  foregoing,  any
day on which dealings in Dollars are carried on in the London interbank market.

                  "CAPITAL  LEASE  OBLIGATIONS"  of any  Person  shall  mean all
obligations  of such  Person  to pay rent or other  amounts  under any lease (or
other arrangement  conveying the right to use) real or personal  property,  or a
combination  thereof,  which  obligations  are  required  to be  classified  and
accounted  for as capital  leases on a balance  sheet of such Person under GAAP,
and the  amount of such  obligations  shall be the  capitalized  amount  thereof
determined in accordance with GAAP.

                  "CATEGORY  1" means A- or  higher  by S&P or A3 or  higher  by
Moody's.

                  "CATEGORY  2" means BBB+ or higher by S&P or Baa1 or higher by
Moody's (but not Category 1).

                  "CATEGORY  3" means  BBB or higher by S&P or Baa2 or higher by
Moody's (but not Category 1 or Category 2).

Borrower with the Administrative Agent or at the Borrower's option, by effecting
a wire transfer of such amounts to an account  designated by the Borrower to the

Loans,  i.e.,  the Term  Loans  shall be either all Base Rate Loans or all LIBOR
Loans.

CONVERSION/CONTINUATION") that are to be converted or continued, as the case may
be, (x) prior to 10:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day prior to the requested  date of
a conversion into Base Rate Loans and (y) prior to 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business
Days prior to a continuation of or conversion into LIBOR Loans. Each such Notice
of  Conversion/Continuation  shall be  irrevocable  and  shall  specify  (i) the
effective   date   of  the   election   made   pursuant   to  such   Notice   of
Continuation/Conversion,  which  shall  be a  Business  Day,  (ii)  whether  the
resulting Term Loans are to be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans;  and (iii) if the
resulting  Term Loans are to be LIBOR  Loans,  the  Interest  Period  applicable
thereto  after  giving  effect  to  such  election,  which  shall  be  a  period
contemplated  by the  definition  of  "INTEREST  PERIOD".  If any such Notice of
Continuation/Conversion  requests  LIBOR  Loans but does not specify an Interest
Period,  the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
(1) month.

                  (c) If, on the expiration of any Interest Period in respect of
LIBOR  Loans,   the   Borrower   shall  have  failed  to  deliver  a  Notice  of
Conversion/Continuation,  then,  unless  such LIBOR Loans are repaid as provided
herein, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Loans
to Base Rate Loans.  The Term Loans may not be converted  into, or continued as,
LIBOR  Loans  if  a  Default  or  an  Event  of  Default   exists,   unless  the
Administrative  Agent and each of the Lenders shall have otherwise  consented in
writing.  No conversion of LIBOR Loans shall be permitted except on the last day
of the Interest Period in respect thereof.

                  (d) Upon receipt of any Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the details thereof.

     SECTION 2.5. REPAYMENT OF LOANS. The Borrower  unconditionally  promises to
pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of the Term Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date.

     SECTION  2.6.  NOTES.  The Term Loan made by each Lender to the Borrower on
the Closing Date shall be evidenced  by a Note of the  Borrower,  payable to the
order of such Lender,  in the amount of such Lender's  Commitment  (or, if less,
the principal amount of the Term Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower on the
Closing Date).  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
appropriate  records  evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender
resulting from the Term Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower,  including the
amounts of principal and interest  payable  thereon and paid to such Lender from
time to time under this  Agreement.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain
appropriate  records in which shall be recorded (i) the Term Loan  Commitment of
each Lender, (ii) the amount of the Term Loan made hereunder by each Lender, the
Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto,  (iii) the date of each
continuation  thereof  pursuant to SECTION 2.4, (iv) the date of each conversion
thereof to another Type  pursuant to SECTION 2.4, (v) the date and amount of any
principal  or interest  due and  payable or to become due and  payable  from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder in

                                       15

<PAGE>

respect of the Term Loan of such Lender and (vi) both the date and amount of any
sum received by the Administrative  Agent hereunder from the Borrower in respect
of the Term Loans and each Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof.  The entries made in
such records  shall be prima facie  evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations  of the Borrower  therein  recorded;  PROVIDED,  that the failure or
delay of any Lender or the Administrative Agent in maintaining or making entries
into any such  record or any error  therein  shall not in any manner  affect the
obligation  of the  Borrower to repay the Term Loan (both  principal  and unpaid
accrued interest) of such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     SECTION 2.7. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right at any
time and  from  time to time to  prepay  the  Term  Loans,  in whole or in part,
without premium or penalty,  by giving irrevocable written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative  Agent no later than
(i) in the case of prepayment of LIBOR Loans, 11:00 a.m. not less than three (3)
Business  Days  prior  to any  such  prepayment,  and  (ii)  in the  case of any
prepayment of Base Rate Loans,  not less than one Business Day prior to the date
of such prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the
proposed date of such prepayment and the principal  amount of the Term Loans, or
portion  thereof,  to  be  prepaid.   Upon  receipt  of  any  such  notice,  the
Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender of the contents
thereof  and of such  Lender's  Pro Rata Share of any such  prepayment.  If such
notice is given,  the aggregate amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date designated in such notice, together with accrued interest to
such date on the amount so prepaid in accordance with SECTION 2.8(e);  PROVIDED,
that if LIBOR Loans are prepaid on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period  applicable  thereto,  the Borrower  shall also pay all amounts  required
pursuant to SECTION 2.14. Each partial  prepayment of the Term Loans shall be in
an amount not less than  $1,000,000  or a larger  multiple of  $1,000,000.  Each
prepayment of the Term Loans shall be applied ratably.

     SECTION 2.8. INTEREST ON TERM LOANS.

                  (a) The Borrower  shall pay interest on Base Rate Loans at the
Base Rate in effect  from time to time and on LIBOR Loans at the  Adjusted  LIBO
Rate for the applicable  Interest Period in effect for such Loans, PLUS, in each
case, the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.

                  (b) While an Event of Default exists or after acceleration, at
the option of the Required  Lenders,  the Borrower shall pay interest  ("DEFAULT
INTEREST") with respect to the Term Loans and all other outstanding  Obligations
at the Default Rate.

                  (c) Interest on the  principal  amount of the Term Loans shall
accrue from and including the date such Term Loans are made to but excluding the
date of any repayment thereof. Interest on all outstanding Base Rate Loans shall
be payable  monthly in arrears on the last day of each calendar month and on the
Maturity Date.  Interest on all outstanding  LIBOR Loans shall be payable on the
last day of each Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  and, in the case of any
LIBOR Loans  having an Interest  Period in excess of three  months,  on each day
which occurs every three months after the initial date of such Interest  Period,
and on the Maturity Date.  Interest on Term Loans which are converted into Loans
of another  Type or which are repaid or prepaid  shall be payable on the date of
such  conversion  or on the date of any such  repayment  or  prepayment  (on the
amount  repaid or prepaid)  thereof.  All Default  Interest  shall be payable on
demand.

                  (d) The  Administrative  Agent shall  determine  each interest
rate  applicable to the Loans  hereunder and shall promptly  notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of such rate in writing (or by telephone,  promptly confirmed in
writing).  Any  such  determination  shall be  conclusive  and  binding  for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

     SECTION 2.9. FEES.

                  (a) AGENCY FEES. The Borrower shall pay to the  Administrative
Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed
upon the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                  (b) CLOSING FEE. The Borrower shall pay to the  Administrative
Agent,  for the  ratable  benefit of each  Lender,  a closing fee equal to 0.25%
multiplied by the aggregate Term Loan Commitments.  The closing fee shall be due
and payable on the Closing Date.

                                       16

<PAGE>

     SECTION  2.10.  COMPUTATION  OF  INTEREST  AND FEES.  All  computations  of
interest  (other than Default  Interest) and fees hereunder shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but  excluding  the last day)  occurring  in the period for which such
interest or fees are  payable  (to the extent  computed on the basis of the days
elapsed).  Each determination by the Administrative  Agent of an interest amount
or fee  hereunder  shall be made in good faith and,  except for manifest  error,
shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

     SECTION  2.11.  INABILITY  TO  DETERMINE  INTEREST  RATES.  If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for LIBOR Loans,

                  (a) the  Administrative  Agent  shall have  determined  (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason
of circumstances  affecting the relevant interbank market, adequate means do not
exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period, or

                  (b) the  Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from
the Required  Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate does not adequately and fairly
reflect  the cost to such  Lenders  (or  Lender,  as the case may be) of making,
funding or  maintaining  their (or its, as the case may be) LIBOR Loans for such
Interest Period,

the  Administrative  Agent  shall give  written  notice (or  telephonic  notice,
promptly  confirmed  in writing) to the  Borrower  and to the Lenders as soon as
practicable  thereafter.  In the case of LIBOR Loans,  until the  Administrative
Agent shall notify the Borrower  and the Lenders that the  circumstances  giving
rise to such  notice no longer  exist,  (i) the  obligations  of the  Lenders to
continue  or convert  outstanding  Term Loans as or into  LIBOR  Loans  shall be
suspended  and (ii) all LIBOR Loans shall be  converted  into Base Rate Loans on
the last day of the then current Interest Period  applicable  thereto unless the
Borrower prepays such LIBOR Loans in accordance with this Agreement.

     SECTION  2.12.  ILLEGALITY.  If any Change in Law shall make in unlawful or
impossible  for any Lender to maintain or fund LIBOR Loans and such Lender shall
so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give
notice  thereof to the  Borrower  and the other  Lenders,  whereupon  until such
Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Lender to
continue or convert an outstanding Base Rate Loan as or into a LIBOR Loan, shall
be suspended and such  outstanding  LIBOR Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate
Loan either (a) on the last day of the then current  Interest Period  applicable
to such LIBOR Loan if such Lender may lawfully  continue to maintain  such LIBOR
Loan to such date or (b)  immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may
not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Loan to such date.  Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  the affected  Lender shall,  prior to giving such notice to the
Administrative  Agent,  designate a different  Applicable Lending Office if such
designation  would avoid the need for giving such notice and if such designation
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in the good faith exercise
of its discretion.

     SECTION 2.13. INCREASED COSTS.

                  (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose,  modify or deem  applicable  any reserve,  special
     deposit  or  similar  requirement  that is not  otherwise  included  in the
     determination  of the  Adjusted  LIBO Rate  hereunder  against  assets  of,
     deposits  with or for the  account  of, or credit  extended  by, any Lender
     (except any such reserve requirement  reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate);
     or

                  (ii) impose on any Lender or the eurodollar  interbank  market
     any other  condition  affecting this Agreement or a LIBOR Loan made by such
     Lender;

and the  result  of the  foregoing  is to  increase  the cost to such  Lender of
converting into,  continuing or maintaining a LIBOR Loan or to increase the cost
to such  Lender or to reduce the amount  received or  receivable  by such Lender
hereunder  (whether  of  principal,  interest  or any  other  amount),  then the
Borrower  shall promptly pay, upon written notice from and demand by such Lender
on the  Borrower  (with a copy of such  notice and demand to the  Administrative
Agent), to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender,  within five
(5) Business Days

                                       17

<PAGE>

after  the  date of  such  notice  and  demand,  additional  amount  or  amounts
sufficient  to  compensate  such Lender for such  additional  costs  incurred or
reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender shall have  determined  that on or after the
date of this Agreement any Change in Law regarding  capital  requirements has or
would have the effect of reducing  the rate of return on such  Lender's  capital
(or on the capital of such Lender's parent  corporation) as a consequence of its
obligations  hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such  Lender's
parent  corporation  could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration  such Lender's  policies or the policies of such  Lender's  parent
corporation  with respect to capital  adequacy) then, from time to time,  within
five (5) Business Days after  receipt by the Borrower of written  demand by such
Lender (with a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay
to such Lender such  additional  amounts as will  compensate such Lender or such
Lender's parent corporation for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) A  certificate  of a Lender  setting  forth the  amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Lender's parent corporation,
as the case may be,  specified in paragraph  (a) or (b) of this Section shall be
delivered to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall be
conclusive,  absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay any such Lender such
amount or amounts within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.

                  (d)  Failure  or  delay on the part of any  Lender  to  demand
compensation  pursuant to this  Section  shall not  constitute  a waiver of such
Lender's right to demand such compensation.

     SECTION  2.14.  FUNDING  INDEMNITY.  In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal  of a LIBOR  Loan other  than on the last day of the  Interest  Period
applicable  thereto  (including  as a result  of an Event of  Default),  (b) the
conversion  or  continuation  of a LIBOR  Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  or (c) the  failure by the  Borrower  to
prepay,  convert  or  continue  any  LIBOR  Loan on the  date  specified  in any
applicable  notice  (regardless of whether such notice is withdrawn or revoked),
then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender,  within five
(5) Business Days after written demand from such Lender,  for any loss,  cost or
expense attributable to such event. In the case of a LIBOR Loan, such loss, cost
or expense shall be deemed to include an amount  determined by such Lender to be
the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the
principal  amount  of such  LIBOR  Loan if such  event had not  occurred  at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable to such LIBOR Loan for the period from the date of
such event to the last day of the then current  Interest  Period therefor (or in
the case of a failure  to convert or  continue,  for the period  that would have
been the  Interest  Period for such LIBOR Loan) over (ii) the amount of interest
that would accrue on the principal amount of such LIBOR Loan for the same period
if the  Adjusted  LIBO Rate were set on the date such LIBOR Loan was  prepaid or
converted or the date on which the Borrower  failed to convert or continue  such
LIBOR Loan. A certificate as to any additional amount payable under this SECTION
2.14  submitted  to the  Borrower  by any  Lender  shall be  conclusive,  absent
manifest error.

     SECTION 2.15. TAXES.

                  (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of
the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes;  PROVIDED,  that if the Borrower shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then
(i) the sum payable  shall be  increased  as  necessary so that after making all
required deductions  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Administrative  Agent or any Lender, as the case may be,
shall  receive  an amount  equal to the sum it would have  received  had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Borrower  shall  pay the  full  amount  deducted  to the  relevant  Governmental
Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative  Agent and
each Lender, on an After-Tax Basis,  within five (5) Business Days after written
demand  therefor,  for the full amount of any  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes
paid by the Administrative  Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with
respect  to any  payment  by or on account  of any  obligation  of the  Borrower
hereunder (including  Indemnified Taxes or Other

                                       18

<PAGE>

Taxes  imposed or  asserted on or  attributable  to amounts  payable  under this
Section) and any penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto,  whether or not such  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes
were  correctly  or legally  imposed or  asserted by the  relevant  Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or
on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as  practicable  after any payment of  Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental  Authority,  the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative  Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return  reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment  reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign  Lender that is entitled to an exemption  from
or reduction of withholding  tax under the law of the  jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located,  or any treaty to which such  jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this  Agreement  shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or  reasonably  requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without  withholding or at a reduced rate.  Without limiting the generality
of the  foregoing,  each  Foreign  Lender  agrees  that it will  deliver  to the
Administrative  Agent and the Borrower (or in the case of a Participant,  to the
Lender from which the related  participation  shall have been purchased) (i) two
(2) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W8-BEN or W8-ECT,  or
any  successor  form thereto,  as the case may be,  certifying in each case that
such  Foreign  Lender is  entitled  to  receive  payments  made by the  Borrower
hereunder and under the Notes payable to it, without deduction or withholding of
any  United  States  federal  income  taxes and (ii) a duly  completed  Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, or any successor form thereto,  as the case may
be, to establish an exemption  from United State backup  withholding  tax.  Each
such Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent
such forms on or before the date that it becomes a party to this  Agreement  (or
in the case of a Participant,  on or before the date such Participant  purchases
the related  participation).  In addition,  each such Lender shall  deliver such
forms  promptly  upon the  obsolescence  or  invalidity  of any form  previously
delivered by such Lender.  Each such Lender shall  promptly  notify the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent at any time that it determines that it is no longer
in a position to provide any  previously  delivered  certificate to the Borrower
(or any other form of certification  adopted by the U.S. taxing  authorities for
such purpose).

     SECTION 2.16. PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS.

                  (a) The Borrower  shall make each payment  required to be made
by it hereunder  (whether of principal,  interest or fees, or of amounts payable
under SECTION 2.13, 2.14 OR 2.15, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, on the date
when due, in immediately  available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any
amounts  received  after  such time on any date may,  in the  discretion  of the
Administrative  Agent,  be deemed to have been  received on the next  succeeding
Business Day for purposes of  calculating  interest  thereon.  All such payments
shall be made to the  Administrative  Agent at the Payment  Office,  except that
payments  pursuant  to  SECTIONS  2.13,  2.14 and  2.15  and 10.3  shall be made
directly  to the  Persons  entitled  thereto.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall
distribute any such payments  received by it for the account of any other Person
to the appropriate  recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment
shall be extended to the next  succeeding  Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be made payable for the period
of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.

                  (b) If at any time  insufficient  funds  are  received  by and
available  to the  Administrative  Agent to pay fully all amounts of  principal,
interest  and fees then due  hereunder,  such funds  shall be applied (i) first,
towards  payment of  interest  and fees then due  hereunder,  ratably  among the
parties  entitled  thereto in  accordance  with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due
hereunder,  ratably among the parties  entitled  thereto in accordance  with the
amounts of principal then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall,  by exercising any right of set-of or
counterclaim  or  otherwise,  obtain  payment in respect of any  principal of or
interest on its Term Loan that would result in such Lender receiving  payment of
a greater  proportion  of the  aggregate  amount  of its Term  Loan and  accrued
interest  thereon than the  proportion  received by any other  Lender,  then the
Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Term Loans of the other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all

                                       19

<PAGE>

such  payments  shall be shared by the Lenders  ratably in  accordance  with the
aggregate  amount of principal of and accrued  interest on their respective Term
Loans;  PROVIDED,  that (i) if any such  participations are purchased and all or
any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be  rescinded  and the  purchase  price  restored  to the  extent  of such
recovery,  without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not
be construed  to apply to any payment  made by the  Borrower  pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a
Lender as consideration  for the assignment of or sale of a participation in its
Term Loan to any  assignee  or  participant,  other than to the  Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate  thereof (as to which the  provisions of this  paragraph
shall apply).  The Borrower  consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent
it may  effectively  do so under  applicable  law,  that any Lender  acquiring a
participation  pursuant to the foregoing  arrangements  may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim  with respect to such  participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct  creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from  the  Borrower  prior  to the  date  on  which  any  payment  is due to the
Administrative  Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower
will not make  such  payment,  the  Administrative  Agent  may  assume  that the
Borrower has made such payment on such date in  accordance  herewith and may, in
reliance upon such  assumption,  distribute to the Lenders the amount or amounts
due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each
of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the  Administrative  Agent forthwith
on demand the amount so  distributed to such Lender with interest  thereon,  for
each day from and  including  the date such amount is  distributed  to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal  Funds  Rate  and a rate  determined  by  the  Administrative  Agent  in
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

                  (e) If any Lender  shall fail to make any payment  required to
be made by it pursuant to SECTION  2.16(d) or 10.3(d),  then the  Administrative
Agent may, in its discretion  (notwithstanding  any contrary  provision hereof),
apply  any  amounts  thereafter  received  by the  Administrative  Agent for the
account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's  obligations under such Sections
until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

     SECTION  2.17.   MITIGATION  OF   OBLIGATIONS.   If  any  Lender   requests
compensation  under  SECTION  2.13,  or if the  Borrower  is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender  pursuant  to SECTION  2.15,  then such Lender  shall use  reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder  or to assign its rights and  obligations  hereunder to another of its
offices,  branches or affiliates,  if, in the sole judgment of such Lender, such
designation  or assignment (i) would  eliminate or reduce amounts  payable under
SECTION 2.13 or SECTION  2.15,  as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would
not  subject  such  Lender to any  unreimbursed  cost or  expense  and would not
otherwise be  disadvantageous  to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay
all  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by  any  Lender  in  connection  with  such
designation or assignment.

     SECTION 2.18. SECURITY FOR OBLIGATIONS. The Term Loans and all of the other
Obligations  shall be secured by the  collateral  described and set forth in the
Security  Documents and shall be unconditionally  and irrevocably  guaranteed by
the Guarantors.

                                  ARTICLE III

                       CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO TERM LOANS
                       ----------------------------------

     SECTION 3.1. CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS. The obligations of the Lenders to
make the Term Loans hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which
each of the following  conditions  is satisfied  (or waived in  accordance  with
SECTION 10.2).

                  (a)  PAYMENT  OF FEES.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall have
received  all fees and other  amounts due and payable on or prior to the Closing
Date,  including   reimbursement  or  payment  of  all  out-of-pocket   expenses
(including  reasonable  fees,  charges  and  disbursements  of  counsel  to  the
Administrative  Agent)  required  to be  reimbursed  or  paid  by  the  Borrower

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                         ------------------------------

                  Effective as of the date of execution of this Agreement,  each
of the Borrower and ADESA  represents and warrants to the  Administrative  Agent
and each Lender as follows:

     SECTION 4.1. ORGANIZATION;  CORPORATE  POWER. It (i) is a corporation  duly
organized,   validly  existing  under  the  laws  of  the  jurisdiction  of  its
organization,  and it has not  filed,  and does not have  pending,  articles  of
dissolution  in  such  jurisdiction,   (ii)  is  duly  qualified  as  a  foreign
corporation and in good standing under the laws of each  jurisdiction  where the
failure to be duly qualified and in good standing would have a Material  Adverse
Effect and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate
and  encumber  its  property and assets and to conduct its business as presently
conducted and as proposed to be conducted in  connection  with and following the
consummation of the Transaction.

     SECTION 4.2. AUTHORITY.  It has the requisite corporate power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents executed or to be executed by
it; and the execution,  delivery and performance (or recording or filing, as the
case may be) of the Loan  Documents,  and the  consummation  of the  Transaction
contemplated  on its part  thereby,  have  been  duly  approved  by its Board of
Directors  and no other  corporate  proceedings  on its part  are  necessary  to
consummate the Transaction.

     SECTION 4.3. DUE  EXECUTION  AND  DELIVERY  OF  LOAN  DOCUMENTS.  The  Loan
Documents  executed by it have been duly  executed and delivered (or recorded or
filed, as the case may be) by it, and, in each case, constitute its legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with the respective
terms of each such  Loan  Document,  except as  enforcement  may be  limited  by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium or other laws relating to or
limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles generally.

     SECTION 4.4. NO CONFLICTS. The execution, delivery and performance by it of
each Loan  Document  to which it is a party and of each  Transaction  do not and
will not (i) violate any Applicable Law or Contractual  Obligation binding on it
the  consequences of which violation,  singly or in the aggregate,  would have a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) result in or require the creation or imposition of
any Lien whatsoever on the Real Property  (other than Permitted  Liens) or (iii)
require any approval of stockholders which has not been obtained.

     SECTION 4.5. GOVERNMENTAL  CONSENTS.  Except as have been made, obtained or
given, no filing or registration  with,  consent or approval of, notice to, with
or by any  Governmental  Authority is required to  authorize,  or is required in
connection  with,  the  execution,  delivery and  performance  by it of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party, the use of the proceeds of the Term Loans made
to effect the refinancing of certain existing liabilities and obligations of the
Borrower related to the Real Property, or the legality, validity, binding effect
or enforceability of any Loan Document.

     SECTION 4.6. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.  It is not an "investment company" or
a company  "controlled"  by an "investment  company",  within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     SECTION 4.7. REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. It is in compliance with all Requirements
of Law  applicable to it and its business,  in each case where the failure to so
comply would have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  either  individually or together
with other such cases.

     SECTION 4.8. RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE REAL PROPERTY.  It is not  a party to
any contract or agreement to sell any interest in the Real  Property or any part
thereof.

     SECTION 4.9. TAXES.  It and its Affiliates have filed all tax returns  that
are  required  to have been filed in any  jurisdiction,  and have paid all taxes
shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and  assessments
levied  upon them or their  properties,  assets,  income or  franchises,  to the
extent  such taxes and  assessments  have become due and payable and before they
have become delinquent,  except for any taxes and assessments (a) the failure of
which to timely pay would not have a Material  Adverse Effect or (b) the amount,
applicability or validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by
appropriate  proceedings,  and  as to

                                       23

<PAGE>

which there is no imminent threat of forfeiture, and with respect to which it or
a  Subsidiary,  as the  case  may  be,  has  established  adequate  reserves  in
accordance  with GAAP; it knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and the charges,
accruals and  reserves on its books in respect of Federal,  state or other taxes
for all fiscal periods are adequate.

     SECTION 4.10. USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS.  The Borrower will apply
the proceeds of the Term Loans as set forth in SECTION  5.10 hereof;  no part of
the proceeds from the Term Loans will be used, directly or indirectly by it, for
the  purpose of buying or  carrying  any  margin  stock  within  the  meaning of
Regulation  U of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System (12 CFR
207),  or for the  purpose of buying or  carrying  or trading in any  securities
under such circumstances as to involve it in a violation of Regulation X of said
Board  (12 CFR 224) or to  involve  any  broker  or  dealer  in a  violation  of
Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220).

     SECTION  4.11.  ERISA EVENT.  No ERISA Event has occurred or is  reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a  Material  Adverse  Effect.  The  present  value of all  accumulated
benefit  obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial  Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most
recent  financial  statements  reflecting  such  amounts,  exceed  by more  than
$1,000,000  the fair  market  value of the assets of such Plan,  and the present
value of all accumulated  benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on
the  assumptions  used for purposes of Statement of Financial  Standards No. 87)
did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements  reflecting such
amounts,  exceed by more than  $1,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of
all such underfunded Plans.

     SECTION 4.12. SOLVENCY.  The Transaction has not been entered into by it in
contemplation  of its insolvency nor has such Transaction been entered into with
the intent to hinder, delay or defraud its equity holders or its creditors.

     SECTION 4.13. DISCLOSURE.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the other Loan
Documents,  nor any  certificate or other document  furnished to any other party
hereto by it or on its behalf  pursuant to any Loan Document  contains,  or will
contain,  as of its date,  any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omits to
state or will omit to state,  as of its date, a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements contained herein and therein not misleading. There are no
facts known to it which, individually or in the aggregate,  materially adversely
affect,  or could  reasonably be expected to materially  adversely  affect,  its
condition, business or affairs or its respective properties and assets, taken as
a whole, which have not been disclosed herein or in written materials  delivered
to any  other  party  hereto  in  connection  with the  negotiation  of the Loan
Documents.

     SECTION 4.14.  TITLE TO  COLLATERAL.  The Borrower owns good and marketable
title to the Real Property and the other collateral  pledged as security for its
obligations in connection with the  Transaction  free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances,  except as ser forth in the Title Policy or otherwise disclosed in
writing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

     SECTION  4.15.  OTHER  OBLIGATIONS.  It is not a party  to or  bound by any
agreement,  contract,  instrument or  understanding or commitment of any kind or
subject to any corporate or other restriction,  the performance or observance of
which by it now or,  as far it can  reasonably  foresee,  will  have a  Material
Adverse  Effect,  financial  or  otherwise,  upon the assets or  business of the
Consolidated  Companies taken as a whole; and neither it nor any other Person to
a contract or agreement material to its financial condition or operations, taken
as a whole, is in default under any such contract or agreement, and no event has
occurred  which,  but for the giving of notice or the passage of time,  or both,
would constitute a default thereunder.

     SECTION 4.16. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  The consolidated balance sheets of the
Consolidated Companies as of the quarterly period most recently ended before the
Closing Date and the statements of income for the period then ended,  heretofore
furnished to the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender,  are true and complete,
have been prepared in accordance  with GAAP (except for the absence of footnotes
and the  lack of year  end  adjustments)  and  fairly  present  in all  material
respects the consolidated  financial condition of the Consolidated  Companies as
of the date  thereof  and the  results of their  operations  for the period then
ended. Since the date thereof,  there has been no material adverse change in the
financial  condition,  properties or businesses  of the  Consolidated  Companies
which has not been disclosed in writing by ADESA to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender.

     SECTION 4.17. LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.


                  (a) No  litigation,  investigation  or proceeding of or before
any  arbitrators  or  Governmental  Authorities  is pending  against  or, to its
knowledge,  threatened against or affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as
to which there is a  reasonable  possibility  of an adverse  determination  that
could reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material  Adverse  Effect or (ii) which in any manner  draws into  question  the
validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

                  (b) To its  knowledge,  except  for the  matters  set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.17,  neither it nor any of its  Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply
with any  Environmental  Law or to obtain,  maintain  or comply with any permit,
license or other approval required under any Environmental  Law, (ii) has become
subject to any Environmental  Liability,  (iii) has received notice of any claim
with respect to any  Environmental  Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any
Environmental  Liability  which, in any such case under clauses (i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) above, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.18.  REAL  PROPERTY.  The present  condition of the Real Property
conforms in all material  respects with all  conditions or  requirements  of all
existing  permits and approvals  issued with respect to such Real Property,  and
the Borrower's  use of such Real Property does not violate any  Applicable  Law,
except for any such violations that have not had, and would not have, a Material
Adverse  Effect.  To  the  Knowledge  of  the  Borrower,  no  material  notices,
complaints  or  orders  of  violation  or  non-compliance  have  been  issued or
threatened or  contemplated  by any  Governmental  Authority with respect to the
Real  Property or any  present or  intended  future use  thereof.  All  material
agreements,  easements and other rights, public or private,  which are necessary
to permit  the  lawful  use and  operation  of the Real  Property  and which are
necessary to permit the lawful use and  operation of all  utilities,  driveways,
roads  and  other  means of egress  and  ingress  to and from the same have been
obtained and are in full force and effect,  and the Borrower has no Knowledge of
any pending material modification or cancellation of any of the same.

All  representations and warranties made in this Article IV shall survive making
of the Term Loans and delivery of the Loan Documents, and shall remain in effect
until all of the Obligations are fully and irrevocably paid.

adjustments,  provided  that  so long  as  ADESA  is  subject  to  informational
requirements  of the Securities  Exchange Act and in accordance  therewith files

Lenders shall be deemed to have been  furnished  with the foregoing  reports and

ADESA  or a  Subsidiary)  and  all  rights  and  franchises  of  ADESA  and  its
Subsidiaries  unless, in the good faith judgment of ADESA, the termination of or

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.4. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC. It will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries  to,  comply with all laws,  ordinances  or  governmental  rules or

non-compliance  with such laws,  ordinances or governmental rules or regulations
or  failures  to  obtain or  maintain  in effect  such  licenses,  certificates,

its  Subsidiaries  to,  file  all  tax  returns  required  to be  filed  in  any

reserves  therefor  in  accordance  with  GAAP on the  books  of  ADESA  or such
Subsidiary,  as  applicable,  or (b)  the  nonpayment  of  all  such  taxes  and

connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times; PROVIDED, that this
SECTION 5.8 shall not prevent ADESA or any  Subsidiary  from  discontinuing  the
operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is
desirable  in the  conduct of its  business  and ADESA has  concluded  that such
discontinuance  could  not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect,  and (b) maintain with  financially
sound  and  reputable  insurance  companies,   insurance  with  respect  to  its
properties and business,  and the  properties and business of its  Subsidiaries,
against loss or damage of the kinds customarily  insured against by companies in
the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations.

     SECTION  5.9.  FURTHER   ASSURANCES.   Upon  the  written  request  of  the

                  Each of ADESA and the  Borrower  covenants  and agrees that so
long as any of the Obligations remain outstanding and unpaid:

     SECTION 7.1.  NEGATIVE PLEDGE.  It will not, and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any of its

that such Lien shall not apply to any other  property  or asset of ADESA or such
Subsidiary;

                  (d)  purchase  money  Liens  upon or in any  fixed or  capital
assets to secure the purchase price or the cost of  construction  or improvement

Obligations);  PROVIDED,  that (i) such Lien attaches to such asset concurrently
or within 90 days  after  the  acquisition,  improvement  or  completion  of the
construction  thereof;  (ii) such Lien does not extend to any other  asset;  and
(iii) the  Indebtedness  secured  thereby does not exceed the cost of acquiring,

violation of any of the financial covenants contained in Article VI;

                  (e) any Lien (i)  existing  on any asset of any  Person at the
time such Person becomes a Subsidiary of ADESA or any Subsidiary,  (ii) existing
on any asset of any Person at the time such  Person is merged with or into ADESA
or any  Subsidiary  or (iii)  existing  on any  asset  prior to the  acquisition
thereof by ADESA or any Subsidiary; PROVIDED, that any such Lien was not created
in the  contemplation  of any of the  foregoing  and any such Lien  secures only
those  obligations  which it  secures  on the date  that such  Person  becomes a
Subsidiary or the date of such merger or the date of such acquisition; and

                  (f) extensions, renewals, or replacements of any Lien referred
to in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this Section;  PROVIDED,  that the principal
amount of the  Indebtedness  secured  thereby is not increased and that any such
extension, renewal or replacement is limited to the assets originally encumbered
thereby.

     SECTION 7.2. FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES.

                  (a) It will not, and will not permit any  Subsidiary to, merge
into or consolidate  into any other Person,  or permit any other Person to merge
into or consolidate with it, or sell,  lease,  transfer or otherwise  dispose of
(in a single  transaction or a series of transactions)  all or substantially all
of its assets (in each case, whether now owned or hereafter  acquired) or all or
substantially all of the stock of any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired) or liquidate or dissolve;  PROVIDED, that if at
the time thereof and  immediately  after giving  effect  thereto,  no Default or
Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be  continuing  (i)  ADESA or any
Subsidiary may merge with a Person if ADESA (or such  Subsidiary if ADESA is not
a party to such merger) is the surviving  Person,  (ii) any Subsidiary may merge
into  another  Subsidiary;  PROVIDED,  that if any  party to such  merger is the
Borrower,  the Borrower shall be the surviving Person,  (iii) any Subsidiary may
sell,  transfer,  lease or otherwise  dispose of all or substantially all of its
assets  to  ADESA  or the  Borrower  and (iv)  any  Subsidiary  (other  than the
Borrower) may liquidate or dissolve if ADESA  determines in good faith that such
liquidation or dissolution is in the best interests of ADESA or such  Subsidiary
and is not materially  disadvantageous to the Lenders;  PROVIDED,  that any such
merger  involving a Person  that is not a  wholly-owned  Subsidiary  immediately
prior to such merger shall not be permitted.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing and
upon notice to the  Administrative  Agent, ADESA shall be allowed to restructure
Automotive Finance Company from a Subsidiary to a company wholly-owned by ALLETE
Automotive Services, Inc., a wholly-owned Subsidiary of ALLETE.

                  (b) It will not,  and will not permit any of its  Subsidiaries

reasonably related thereto.

     SECTION 7.3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. It will not, and will not permit
any of its Subsidiaries  to, sell,  lease or otherwise  transfer any property or
assets to, or purchase,  lease or otherwise acquire any property or assets from,
or  otherwise  engage in any other  transactions  with,  any of its  Affiliates,
except  (a) in the  ordinary  course  of  business  at  prices  and on terms and
conditions not less favorable to it or such Subsidiary than could be obtained on
an arm's-length basis from unrelated third parties, and (b) transactions between
or among  ADESA  and its  wholly-owned  Subsidiaries  not  involving  any  other
Affiliates.

     SECTION 7.4. RESTRICTIVE  AGREEMENTS.  It will not, and will not permit any
Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,  enter into, incur or permit to exist any
agreement  that  prohibits,  restricts  or imposes  any  condition  upon (a) the
ability of ADESA or any Subsidiary to create,  incur or permit any Lien upon any
of its assets or properties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or (b) the
ability of any Subsidiary to pay dividends or other  distributions  with respect
to its common  stock,  to make or repay  loans or advances to ADESA or any other
Subsidiary,  to Guarantee  Indebtedness  of ADESA or any other  Subsidiary or to
transfer any of its property or assets to ADESA or the Borrower;  PROVIDED, that
(i) the foregoing shall not apply to  restrictions or conditions  imposed by law
or by this  Agreement or any other Loan Document,  (ii) the foregoing  shall not
apply to customary  restrictions and conditions contained in agreements relating
to the sale of a Subsidiary  pending such sale,  provided such  restrictions and
conditions  apply only to the Subsidiary that is sold and such sale is permitted
hereunder,  and (iii)  clause  (a) shall not apply to  customary  provisions  in
leases and other contracts restricting the assignment thereof.

     SECTION 7.5. [INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK].

     SECTION 7.6.  HEDGING  AGREEMENTS.  It will not, and will not permit any of
the  Subsidiaries  to,  enter into any  Hedging  Agreement,  other than  Hedging
Agreements  entered into in the ordinary course of business to hedge or mitigate
risks to which ADESA or any Subsidiary is exposed in the conduct of its business
or the management of its liabilities.  Solely for the avoidance of doubt,  ADESA
acknowledges that a Hedging  Agreement entered into for speculative  purposes or
of a speculative  nature (which shall be deemed to include any Hedging Agreement
under which ADESA or any of the  Subsidiaries  is or may become  obliged to make
any payment (i) in connection with the purchase by any third party of any common
stock or any  Indebtedness or (ii) as a result of changes in the market value of
any common stock or any Indebtedness) is not a Hedging Agreement entered into in
the ordinary course of business to hedge or mitigate risks.

     SECTION  7.7.  AMENDMENT TO MATERIAL  DOCUMENTS.  It will not, and will not
permit any Subsidiary  to, amend,  modify or waive any of its rights in a manner
materially  adverse to the Lenders under (a) its  certificate of  incorporation,
bylaws or other organizational documents or (b) any material contracts.

     SECTION  7.8.  ACCOUNTING  CHANGES.  It will not,  and will not  permit any
Subsidiary to, make any significant change in accounting  treatment or reporting
practices,  except as required by GAAP, or change the fiscal year of ADESA or of
any Subsidiary,  except to change the fiscal year of a Subsidiary to conform its
fiscal year to that of ADESA.

                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

"EVENT OF DEFAULT") shall occur:

                  (a) the Borrower  shall fail to pay any  principal of any Term
Loan when and as the same shall become due and payable,  whether at the due date
thereof or at a date fixed for prepayment or otherwise; or

                  (b) the  Borrower  shall fail to pay any  interest on any Term
Loan or any fee or any other amount  (other than an amount  payable under clause

Loan  Document,  when and as the same  shall  become due and  payable,  and such
failure shall continue unremedied for a period of three (3) Business Days; or

                  (c) any  representation  or warranty made or deemed made by or
on behalf of ADESA or the Borrower in or in  connection  with this  Agreement or
any other Loan  Document  (including  the  Schedules  attached  thereto) and any
amendments or modifications hereof or waivers hereunder,  or in any certificate,
report,  financial  statement or other document  submitted to the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders by ADESA or the Borrower or any  representative of ADESA or
the Borrower  pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall prove to be incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed
made or submitted; or

                  (d) ADESA or the Borrower shall fail to observe or perform any
covenant or  agreement  contained  in  SECTIONS  5.2,  5.3 (with  respect to the
applicable party's existence) or ARTICLES VI or VII; or

                  (e) ADESA or the Borrower  shall fail in any material  respect
to timely  observe  or perform  any  covenant  or  agreement  contained  in this
Agreement  (other than those  referred to in clauses  (a), (b) and (d) above) or
any other Loan  Document to be  performed  or observed by it  hereunder or under
such other Loan Document and such failure shall  continue for a period of thirty
(30) days after the  earlier of (i)  ADESA's  or  Borrower's  receipt of written
notice  thereof  from the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender or (ii) ADESA or
Borrower shall have knowledge of such failure;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if such
failure is capable of cure,  but is not  capable of cure  within such thirty day
period,  so long as ADESA or Borrower  shall be  diligently  pursuing such cure,
such failure shall not  constitute an Event of Default  unless it shall continue
for a period of ninety (90) days after the earlier of (x) ADESA's or  Borrower's
receipt of written notice thereof from the Administrative Agent or any Lender or
(y) ADESA or Borrower shall have knowledge of such failure; or

                  (f) any of the  Consolidated  Companies  (whether  as  primary

premium or interest on any Material  Indebtedness that is outstanding,  when and
as the same  shall  become  due and  payable  (whether  at  scheduled  maturity,
required prepayment,  acceleration, demand or otherwise), and such failure shall
continue after the applicable grace period,  if any,  specified in the agreement
or instrument  evidencing such Material  Indebtedness;  or any other event shall
occur or condition  shall exist under any  agreement or  instrument  relating to
such Material Indebtedness and shall continue after the applicable grace period,
if any,  specified in such agreement or instrument,  if the effect of such event
or condition is to accelerate,  or permit the  acceleration  of, the maturity of
such Material Indebtedness;  or any such Material Indebtedness shall be declared
to be due and  payable;  or required to be prepaid or redeemed  (other than by a
regularly scheduled required  prepayment or redemption),  purchased or defeased,
or any offer to prepay,  redeem,  purchase or defease such Indebtedness shall be
required to be made, in each case prior to the stated maturity thereof; or

                  (g) any Loan  Party  shall (i)  commence a  voluntary  case or
other proceeding or file any petition  seeking  liquidation,  reorganization  or
other relief under any federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency or other

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
                            ------------------------

     SECTION 9.1.  APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT. Each Lender irrevocably
appoints  SunTrust Bank as the  Administrative  Agent and  authorizes it to take
such actions on its behalf and to exercise  such powers as are  delegated to the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together
with all such actions and powers that are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The
Administrative  Agent may perform any of its duties  hereunder by or through any
one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent and any such  sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise
its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory
provisions  set forth in this Article shall apply to any such  sub-agent and the
Related  Parties of the  Administrative  Agent and any such  sub-agent and shall
apply to their  respective  activities in connection with the syndication of the
credit  facilities  provided for herein as well as activities as  Administrative
Agent.

     SECTION 9.2. NATURE OF DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT. The  Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or obligations  except those expressly set forth
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality
of the  foregoing,  (a) the  Administrative  Agent  shall not be  subject to any
fiduciary or other implied  duties,  regardless of whether a Default or an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing,  (b) the  Administrative  Agent shall
not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers,  except those discretionary rights and powers expressly  contemplated by
the Loan  Documents  that the  Administrative  Agent is  required to exercise in
writing by the  Required  Lenders  (or such other  number or  percentage  of the
Lenders as shall be  necessary  under the  circumstances  as provided in SECTION
10.2),  and (c)  except  as  expressly  set  forth  in the Loan  Documents,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall  not have any duty to  disclose,  and  shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose,  any information  relating to any Loan Party
or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  that  is  communicated  to or  obtained  by  the
Administrative   Agent  or  any  of  its   Affiliates  in  any   capacity.   The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary  under the  circumstances  as
provided  in  SECTION  10.2) or in the  absence of its own gross  negligence  or
willful  misconduct.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  not be  deemed  to have
knowledge  of any Default or Event of Default  unless and until  written  notice
thereof is given to the Administrative  Agent by a Loan Party or any Lender, and
the  Administrative  Agent  shall  not be  responsible  for or have  any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,  warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document,  (ii) the contents of any  certificate,
report or other  document  delivered  hereunder or  thereunder  or in connection
herewith  or  therewith,  (iii)  the  performance  or  observance  of any of the
covenants,  agreements,  or other  terms  and  conditions  set forth in any Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan  Document  or any  other  agreement,  instrument  or  document,  or (v) the
satisfaction  of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere in any Loan
Document,  other  than to  confirm  receipt of items  expressly  required  to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

     SECTION  9.3.  LACK OF RELIANCE ON THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT.  Each of the
Lenders  acknowledges  that it has,  independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative  Agent  or any  other  Lender  and  based on such  documents  and
information  as it has  deemed  appropriate,  made its own credit  analysis  and
decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each of the Lenders  also  acknowledges
that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Administrative  Agent
or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate,  continue to make its own  decisions in taking or not taking of any
action under or based on this Agreement,  any related  agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.

     SECTION  9.4.   CERTAIN  RIGHTS  OF  THE   ADMINISTRATIVE   AGENT.  If  the
Administrative  Agent shall request  instructions from the Required Lenders with
respect to any action or actions  (including  the failure to act) in  connection
with this Agreement,  the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from
such  act  or  taking  such  act,  unless  and  until  it  shall  have  received
instructions  from such Lenders;  and the  Administrative  Agent shall not incur
liability  to any  Person by  reason  of so  refraining.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing,  no Lender  shall  have any right of action  whatsoever  against  the
Administrative  Agent  as  a  result  of  the  Administrative  Agent  acting  or

                                       33

<PAGE>

refraining  from acting  hereunder in accordance  with the  instructions  of the
Required Lenders where required by the terms of this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.5. RELIANCE BY  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT. The  Administrative  Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon,  and shall not incur any  liability  for relying
upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document
or other writing  believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed,  sent or
made by the  proper  Person.  The  Administrative  Agent  may also rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper  Person  and shall  not incur any  liability  for  relying  thereon.  The
Administrative  Agent may consult with legal counsel  (including counsel for any
Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in  accordance  with
the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

     SECTION 9.6. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.  The bank
serving as the Administrative  Agent shall have the same rights and powers under
this  Agreement  and any other Loan  Document in its capacity as a Lender as any
other Lender and may exercise or refrain from  exercising  the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent; and the terms "LENDERS",  "REQUIRED LENDERS",
"HOLDERS  OF NOTES",  or any similar  terms  shall,  unless the context  clearly
otherwise  indicates,   include  the  Administrative  Agent  in  its  individual
capacity.  The bank acting as the  Administrative  Agent and its  Affiliates may
accept  deposits  from,  lend  money  to,  and  generally  engage in any kind of
business with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Loan Party as
if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

     SECTION 9.7. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  (a) The Administrative  Agent may resign at any time by giving
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Loan Parties.  Upon any such  resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor  Administrative
Agent,  subject to the approval by the Loan Parties  provided that no Default or
Event of Default shall exist at such time. If no successor  Administrative Agent
shall have been so appointed,  and shall have accepted such  appointment  within
thirty  (30) days  after  the  retiring  Administrative  Agent  gives  notice of
resignation,  then the  retiring  Administrative  Agent  may,  on  behalf of the
Lenders,  appoint a successor  Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial
bank  organized  under the laws of the  United  States of  America  or any state
thereof  or a bank which  maintains  an office in the  United  States,  having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.

                  (b)   Upon  the   acceptance   of  its   appointment   as  the
Administrative  Agent  hereunder by a successor,  such successor  Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the retiring  Administrative  Agent,  and the retiring
Administrative  Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations  under
this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents.  If within  forty-five  (45) days
after written notice is given of the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
under  this  SECTION  9.7 no  successor  Administrative  Agent  shall  have been
appointed and shall have accepted  such  appointment,  then on such 45th day (i)
the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall become effective, (ii) the
retiring  Administrative Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and
obligations  under  the Loan  Documents  and (iii) the  Required  Lenders  shall
thereafter  perform all duties of the  retiring  Administrative  Agent under the
Loan  Documents  until such time as the  Required  Lenders  appoint a  successor
Administrative  Agent as  provided  above.  After  any  retiring  Administrative
Agent's resignation hereunder,  the provisions of this Article IX shall continue
in  effect  for  the  benefit  of such  retiring  Administrative  Agent  and its
representatives  and agents in respect of any actions  taken or not taken by any
of them while it was serving as the Administrative Agent.

Administrative Agent and the Lenders of a confirmation which is at variance with
the terms understood by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to be contained
in any such telephonic or facsimile notice.

     SECTION 10.2. WAIVER; AMENDMENTS.

                  (a) No  failure  or delay by the  Administrative  Agent or any
Lender in exercising  any right or power  hereunder or any other Loan  Document,
and no course of dealing between any Loan Party and the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender,  shall operate as a waiver thereof,  nor shall any single or partial
exercise  of any such right or power or any  abandonment  or  discontinuance  of
steps to enforce  such right or power,  preclude  any other or further  exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power hereunder or thereunder. The
rights and remedies of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  hereunder and
under the other Loan  Documents  are  cumulative  and are not  exclusive  of any
rights or remedies provided by law. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or any other  Loan  Document  or  consent  to any  departure  by any Loan  Party
therefrom shall in any event

                                       36

be  effective  unless  the same  shall be  permitted  by  paragraph  (b) of this
Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purpose for which given.

                  (b) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this  Agreement
or the other Loan  Documents,  nor  consent to any  departure  by any Loan Party
therefrom,  shall in any event be effective  unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by each of the Loan Parties and the  Required  Lenders or each of the
Loan  Parties  and the  Administrative  Agent with the  consent of the  Required
Lenders and then such waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific
instance  and for the  specific  purpose  for  which  given;  PROVIDED,  that no
amendment or waiver shall:  (i) reduce the principal  amount of any Term Loan or
reduce  the rate of  interest  thereon,  or reduce any fees  payable  hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected  thereby,  (ii) postpone the
date fixed for any payment of any principal of, or interest on, any Term Loan or
interest  thereon or any fees hereunder or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse
any such payment,  or extend the Maturity Date,  without the written  consent of
each Lender  affected  thereby,  (iii) change SECTION 2.16(b) or (c) in a manner
that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby , without the
written  consent  of each  Lender,  (iv)  change any of the  provisions  of this
Section or the definition of "REQUIRED  LENDERS" or any other  provision  hereof
specifying  the number or  percentage  of Lenders  which are  required to waive,
amend or modify  any rights  hereunder  or make any  determination  or grant any
consent hereunder, without the consent of each Lender; (v) release any Guarantor
or limit the liability of any such Guarantor under the Guaranty Agreement;  (vi)
release all or substantially  all collateral  securing any of the Obligations or
agree to  subordinate  any Lien in such  collateral to any other creditor of the
Borrower;  PROVIDED  FURTHER,  that no such  agreement  shall  amend,  modify or
otherwise affect the rights,  duties or obligations of the Administrative  Agent
without the prior  written  consent of the  Administrative  Agent.  The Borrower
agrees to pay to each  Lender  an  administration  fee equal to $2,500  for each
amendment,  supplement  or other  modification  of, or waiver in respect of, any
Loan  Document,  which fee shall be  payable  as of the  effective  date of such
amendment,  supplement,  modification or waiver (and the Administrative Agent is
authorized  by the  Borrower  to debit  amounts on deposit in any of  Borrower's
accounts maintained with the Administrative Agent for such payment).

     SECTION 10.3. EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all  reasonable,  out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the
reasonable fees,  charges and  disbursements  of counsel for the  Administrative
Agent and its  Affiliates,  in  connection  with the  syndication  of the credit
facilities  provided for herein,  the preparation and administration of the Loan
Documents and any amendments,  modifications  or waivers thereof (whether or not
the Transaction  shall be  consummated),  and (ii) all  out-of-pocket  costs and
expenses  (including,  without  limitation,  the  reasonable  fees,  charges and
disbursements  of outside  counsel  and the  allocated  cost of inside  counsel)
incurred  by the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender  in  connection  with the
enforcement  or  protection  of its rights in  connection  with this  Agreement,
including  its rights under this Section,  or in connection  with the Term Loans
made hereunder,  including all such  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative  Agent and
each  Lender  and each  Related  Party,  on an  After-Tax  Basis,  of any of the
foregoing (each, an "INDEMNITEE")  against, and hold each of them harmless from,
any and all costs, losses,  liabilities,  claims,  damages and related expenses,
including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee,
which may be incurred by or asserted  against any Indemnitee  arising out of, in
connection  with  or as a  result  of (i)  the  execution  or  delivery  of this
Agreement  or  any  other  agreement  or  instrument  contemplated  hereby,  the
performance by the parties hereto of their respective  obligations  hereunder or
the  consummation  of the  Transaction,  (ii) the Term  Loans or any  actual  or
proposed use of the proceeds therefrom,  (iii) any actual or alleged presence or
release of Hazardous  Materials on or from any property owned by the Borrower or
any Subsidiary or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower
or  any  Subsidiary  or  (iv)  any  actual  or  prospective  claim,  litigation,
investigation or proceeding  relating to any of the foregoing,  whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto;  PROVIDED,  that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify
any Indemnitee for any of the foregoing arising out of such  Indemnitee's  gross
negligence  or  willful  misconduct  as  determined  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment.

                  (c) The Borrower shall pay, and hold the Administrative  Agent
and each of the  Lenders  harmless  from and  against,  any and all  present and
future  stamp,  documentary,  and  other  similar  taxes  with  respect

                                       37

<PAGE>

to this  Agreement  and any  other  Loan  Documents,  any  collateral  described
therein, or any payments due thereunder,  and save the Administrative  Agent and
each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay or omission to pay such taxes.

                  (d) To the extent  that the  Borrower  fails to pay any amount
required to be paid to the  Administrative  Agent under  clauses (a), (b) or (c)
hereof,  each Lender  severally agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent such
Lender's Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the unreimbursed expense
or  indemnity  payment is  sought) of such  unpaid  amount;  PROVIDED,  that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified payment, claim, damage, liability or related
expense,  as  the  case  may  be,  was  incurred  by  or  asserted  against  the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

                  (e) To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law, the Borrower
shall not assert,  and hereby waives,  any claim against any Indemnitee,  on any
theory of liability,  for special,  indirect,  consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to actual or direct  damages)  arising out of, in connection with or
as a result of, this  Agreement  or any  agreement  or  instrument  contemplated
hereby,  the  transactions  contemplated  therein,  the Term Loans or the use of
proceeds thereof.

                  (f) All  amounts  due  under  this  Section  shall be  payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

     SECTION 10.4. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their  respective  successors and
assigns,  except that the  Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights
hereunder  without the prior  written  consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment  or transfer by the Borrower  without such consent  shall be null and
void).

                  (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees
all or a portion of its  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement  and the
other Loan  Documents  (including  all or a portion of the Term Loan at the time
owing to it); PROVIDED, that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender
or an Affiliate of a Lender , each of the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent
must give their prior written  consent (which consent shall not be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender or an  assignment  of the entire  amount of the  assigning
Lender's  Term Loan  hereunder  or an  assignment  while an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing,  the amount of the Term Loan of the assigning Lender
subject to each such  assignment  (determined  as of the date the Assignment and
Acceptance  with respect to such  assignment is delivered to the  Administrative
Agent)  shall  not  be  less  than  $5,000,000  (unless  the  Borrower  and  the
Administrative  Agent shall otherwise  consent),  (iii) each partial  assignment
shall be made as an  assignment  of a  proportionate  part of all the  assigning
Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents,  (iv) the assigning Lender and the assignee shall execute and deliver
to the  Administrative  Agent an  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  together  with a
processing and recordation  fee payable by the assigning  Lender or the assignee
(as  determined  between such Persons) in an amount equal to $2,500 and (v) such
assignee,  if it is not a Lender, shall deliver a duly completed  Administrative
Questionnaire to the Administrative Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent;  PROVIDED,  that any consent of the Borrower otherwise
required hereunder shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.  Upon the execution and delivery of the Assignment and Acceptance
and payment by such assignee to the  assigning  Lender of an amount equal to the
purchase price agreed  between such Persons,  such assignee shall become a party
to this Agreement and any other Loan Documents to which such assigning Lender is
a party and,  to the extent of such  interest  assigned by such  Assignment  and
Acceptance,  shall  have the  rights  and  obligations  of a Lender  under  this
Agreement,  and the  assigning  Lender  shall be released  from its  obligations
hereunder to a  corresponding  extent  (and,  in the case of an  Assignment  and
Acceptance  covering all of the assigning  Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of SECTIONS  2.13,  2.14 and 2.15 and 10.3.  Upon
the consummation of any such assignment  hereunder,  the assigning  Lender,  the
Administrative  Agent and the Borrower shall make  appropriate  arrangements  to
have new Notes issued if so requested by either or both the assigning  Lender or
the assignee.  Any  assignment or other transfer by a Lender that does not fully
comply with the terms of this  clause (b) shall be treated for  purposes of this
Agreement as a sale of a participation pursuant to clause (c) below.

                                       38

<PAGE>

                  (c) Any Lender  may at any time,  without  the  consent of the
Borrower or the Administrative  Agent, sell  participations to one or more banks
or other entities (a  "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights
and  obligations  under this  Agreement  (including all or a portion of the Term
Loan  owing to it);  PROVIDED,  that (i) such  Lender's  obligations  under this
Agreement  shall  remain  unchanged,   (ii)  such  Lender  shall  remain  solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the  performance of its  obligations
hereunder,  and  (iii)  the  Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent and the other
Lenders  shall  continue  to deal  solely  and  directly  with  such  Lender  in
connection with such Lender's  rights and  obligations  under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.  Any agreement between such Lender and the Participant
with respect to such  participation  shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right and  responsibility  to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of this
Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents;  PROVIDED,  that  such  participation
agreement  may provide  that such  Lender  will not,  without the consent of the
Participant,  agree to any amendment,  modification  or waiver of this Agreement
described in the first proviso of SECTION 10.2(b) that affects the  Participant.
The Borrower agrees that each  Participant  shall be entitled to the benefits of
SECTIONS 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender hereunder
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b); PROVIDED,
that no  Participant  shall be entitled to receive  any  greater  payment  under
SECTION  2.13 or 2.15 than the  applicable  Lender  would have been  entitled to
receive with respect to the  participation  sold to such Participant  unless the
sale of such participation is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. To
the extent permitted by law, the Borrower agrees that each Participant  shall be
entitled to the benefits of SECTION  2.16 as though it were a Lender,  PROVIDED,
that such  Participant  agrees to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof in
accordance  with  SECTION  2.16 as  fully as if it were a  Lender  hereunder.  A
Participant  that  would be a Foreign  Lender  if it were a Lender  shall not be
entitled to the benefits of SECTION 2.15 unless the Borrower is notified of such
participation  sold to such  Participant and such  Participant  agrees,  for the
benefit of the  Borrower,  to comply  with  SECTION  2.15(e) as though it were a
Lender hereunder.

                  (d) Any  Lender  may at any time  pledge or assign a  security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this  Agreement and its Notes
(if any) to secure its obligations to a Federal  Reserve Bank without  complying
with this Section;  PROVIDED,  that no such pledge or assignment shall release a
Lender from any of its  obligations  hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     SECTION 10.5. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS.

                  (a) This  Agreement  and the  other  Loan  Documents  shall be
construed in accordance  with and be governed by the law (without  giving effect
to the conflict of law principles thereof) of the State of Florida.

                  (b)  The  Borrower  hereby  irrevocably  and   unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property,  to the non-exclusive  jurisdiction of the
United States District Court of the Middle District of Florida, and of any state
court of the State of Florida  located in Orange County and any appellate  court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the  Transaction,  or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment,  and each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably
and  unconditionally  agrees  that all claims in  respect of any such  action or
proceeding  may be heard and  determined in such Florida state court or , to the
extent  permitted by  Applicable  Law, such Federal  court.  Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final  judgment in any such action or  proceeding  shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall affect any right that the Administrative  Agent or any Lender may
otherwise  have to bring any action or proceeding  relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document  against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of
any jurisdiction.

                  (c) The Borrower  irrevocably and  unconditionally  waives any
objection  which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such
suit,  action or  proceeding  described  in  paragraph  (b) of this  Section and
brought in any court  referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

                  (d) Each party to this Agreement  irrevocably  consents to the
service of process in the manner  provided for notices in SECTION 10.1.  Nothing
in this  Agreement  or in any other Loan  Document  will affect the right of any
party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

                                       39

<PAGE>

     SECTION 10.6. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE  LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT  OR ANY OTHER  LOAN  DOCUMENT  OR THE  TRANSACTION  (WHETHER  BASED ON
CONTRACT,  TORT OR ANY OTHER  THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES  THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,  SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE  FOREGOING  WAIVER,  AND (B)  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,  THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION.

     SECTION 10.7.  RIGHT OF SETOFF.  In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted  under  applicable  law and not by way of limitation of any such rights,
each  Lender  shall  have the  right,  at any time or from time to time upon the
occurrence  and during the  continuance  of an Event of Default,  without  prior
notice to the Loan Parties,  any such notice being expressly  waived by the Loan
Parties to the extent  permitted by Applicable Law, to set off and apply against
all deposits (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final) of any
Loan  Party at any  time  held or other  obligations  at any time  owing by such
Lender to or for the credit or the  account of such Loan Party  against  any and
all  Obligations  held by such Lender  irrespective of whether such Lender shall
have made demand hereunder and although such Obligations may be unmatured.  Each
Lender agrees  promptly to notify the  Administrative  Agent and each Loan Party
after any such set-off and any application made by such Lender;  PROVIDED,  that
the failure to give such notice  shall not affect the  validity of such  set-off
and application.

     SECTION 10.8. COUNTERPARTS;  INTEGRATION. This Agreement may be executed by
one or  more  of the  parties  to  this  Agreement  on any  number  of  separate
counterparts  (including  by  telecopy),  and  all of  said  counterparts  taken
together  shall  be  deemed  to  constitute  one and the same  instrument.  This
Agreement,  the other  Loan  Documents,  and any  separate  letter  agreement(s)
relating to any fees payable to the  Administrative  Agent constitute the entire
agreement  among the parties  hereto and thereto  regarding the subject  matters
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and  understandings,  oral
or written, regarding such subject matters.

     SECTION 10.9. EFFECTIVENESS; SURVIVAL.

                  (a) This  Agreement  shall  become  effective on the date (the
"EFFECTIVE  DATE")  on which  all of the  parties  hereto  shall  have  signed a
counterpart  hereof  (whether  the  same or  different  counterparts)  and  have
delivered the same to the Administrative Agent pursuant to SECTION 3.1(b) or, in
the case of the Lenders, shall have given to the Administrative Agent written or
facsimile notice (actually received) that the same has been signed and mailed to
the Administrative Agent; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  notwithstanding execution of this
Agreement  by the  Loan  Parties  and  each  of the  Lenders  party  hereto  and
satisfaction  (or waiver) of each of the  conditions  set forth in SECTION  3.1,
this  Agreement  shall not be or become  effective  and binding upon the parties
until executed and accepted by the Administrative  Agent in its capacity as such
on behalf of the Lenders.

                  (b) All covenants, agreements,  representations and warranties
made by the Loan Parties  herein and in the  certificates  or other  instruments
delivered in connection  with or pursuant to this Agreement  shall be considered
to have been  relied  upon by the other  parties  hereto and shall  survive  the
execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement  and the making of the Term  Loans,
regardless  of any  investigation  made by any such other party or on its behalf
and  notwithstanding  that the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or  incorrect  representation  or warranty at
the time any credit is extended hereunder,  and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the  principal of or any accrued  interest on any Term Loan or
any fee or any other amount  payable  under this  Agreement is  outstanding  and
unpaid.  The  provisions of SECTIONS 2.13,  2.14,  2.15, and 10.3 and Article IX
shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation
of the  Transaction,  the repayment of the Term Loans or the termination of this
Agreement or any provision  hereof.  All  representations  and  warranties  made
herein, in the certificates,  reports,  notices,  and other documents  delivered
pursuant to this  Agreement  shall  survive the  execution  and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the making of the Term Loans.

     SECTION 10.10.  SEVERABILITY.  Any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document held to be illegal,  invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such

                                       40

<PAGE>

illegality,  invalidity  or  unenforceability  without  affecting  the legality,
validity or  enforceability of the remaining  provisions hereof or thereof;  and
the illegality,  invalidity or unenforceability  of a particular  provision in a
particular  jurisdiction  shall  not  invalidate  or render  unenforceable  such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

     SECTION 10.11.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Administrative  Agent and each Lender
agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions to maintain the confidentiality
of any information  designated in writing as confidential  and provided to it by
any Loan  Party or any  Subsidiary  of any such  Loan  Party,  except  that such
information  may be  disclosed  (i) to any Related  Party of the  Administrative
Agent  or any such  Lender,  including  without  limitation  accountants,  legal
counsel and other  advisors,  (ii) to the extent  required by applicable laws or
regulations  or by any subpoena or similar  legal  process,  (iii) to the extent
requested by any  regulatory  agency or authority,  (iv) to the extent that such
information  becomes  publicly  available  other than as a result of a breach of
this Section, or which becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender
or any Related Party of any of the foregoing on a  nonconfidential  basis from a
source  other than a Loan  Party,  (v) in  connection  with the  exercise of any
remedy hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the   enforcement   of  rights   hereunder,   and  (ix)  subject  to  provisions
substantially  similar  to this  SECTION  10.11,  to any  actual or  prospective
assignee or Participant,  or (vi) with the consent of the applicable Loan Party.
Any Person  required to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of any  information  as
provided for in this  Section  shall be  considered  to have  complied  with its
obligation  to do so if such  Person has  exercised  the same  degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such information as such Person would accord its
own confidential information.

     SECTION 10.12. INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the  contrary,  if at any time the interest  rate  applicable  to any Term Loan,
together  with all fees,  charges  and other  amounts  which may be  treated  as
interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively,  the "CHARGES"), shall
exceed the maximum  lawful rate of interest  (the  "MAXIMUM  RATE") which may be
contracted for,  charged,  taken,  received or reserved by a Lender holding such
Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest  payable in respect
of such Loan hereunder,  together with all Charges  payable in respect  thereof,
shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and
Charges  that  would  have been  payable  in  respect  of such Loan but were not
payable as a result of the  operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the
interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together  with  interest  thereon  at the  Federal  Funds  Rate  to the  date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                               GUARANTY AGREEMENT

                                   GUARANTY AGREEMENT dated as of June 30, 2003,
                         among ADESA CORPORATION,  an Indiana  corporation,  and
                         ALLETE,    INC.,   a   Minnesota    corporation   (each
                         individually,  a  "GUARANTOR"  and  collectively,   the
                         "GUARANTORS") of ADESA  CALIFORNIA,  INC., a California
                         corporation  (the  "BORROWER"),  and  SUNTRUST  BANK, a
                         Georgia  banking  corporation as  administrative  agent
                         (the  "ADMINISTRATIVE   AGENT")  for  the  Lenders  (as
                         defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below).

               Reference is made to the Term Loan Agreement dated as of June 30,
2003 (as amended,  supplemented  or otherwise  modified  from time to time,  the
"CREDIT  AGREEMENT"),  among the  Borrower,  the lenders from time to time party
thereto (the  "LENDERS")  and SunTrust  Bank,  as  administrative  agent for the
Lenders  (in  such  capacity,  the  "ADMINISTRATIVE   AGENT"),   joined  by  the
Guarantors.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.

               The  Lenders  have  agreed  to make  Term  Loans to the  Borrower
pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions  specified in, the
Credit Agreement.  The Borrower is the direct  wholly-owned  Subsidiary of ADESA
Corporation  ("ADESA") which, in turn, is an indirect Subsidiary of ALLETE, Inc.
("ALLETE"),  and accordingly,  each of the Guarantors  acknowledges that it will
derive substantial benefit from the making of the Term Loans by the Lenders. The
obligations  of the  Lenders to make the Term Loans are  conditioned  on,  among
other  things,  the  execution  and  delivery  by the  Guarantors  of a Guaranty
Agreement in the form hereof.  As consideration  therefor and in order to induce
the Lenders to make the Term Loans,  the  Guarantors are willing to execute this
Guaranty Agreement.

               Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

               SECTION 1. GUARANTEE. Each Guarantor unconditionally  guarantees,
jointly with the other  Guarantors and severally,  as a primary  obligor and not
merely as a surety, (a) the due and punctual payment of (i) the principal of and
premium,  if any, and interest  (including interest accruing during the pendency
of  any  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  receivership  or  other  similar  proceeding,
regardless  of whether  allowed or  allowable  in such  proceeding)  on the Term
Loans, when and as due, whether at maturity,  by acceleration,  upon one or more
dates set for prepayment or otherwise,  and (ii) all other monetary obligations,
including fees,  costs,  expenses and indemnities,  whether primary,  secondary,
direct, contingent,  fixed or otherwise (including monetary obligations incurred
during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar
proceeding,  regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such proceeding),  of
the Loan Parties to the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  under the Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  (b) the due and punctual performance of
all covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities of the Loan Parties under
or pursuant to the Credit  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents;  and (c) the
due and punctual  payment and  performance  of all  obligations of the Borrower,
monetary  or  otherwise,  under  each  Hedging  Agreement  entered  into  with a
counterparty  that was a Lender  or an  Affiliate  of a Lender  at the time such
Hedging  Agreement  was entered  into (all the  monetary  and other  obligations
referred to in the preceding clauses (a) through (c) being  collectively  called
the  "OBLIGATIONS").  Each Guarantor  further agrees that the Obligations may be
extended or renewed,  in whole or in part (but the principal amount of the Notes
may not be increased),  without notice to or further assent from it, and that it
will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of
any Obligation.

               SECTION 2.  OBLIGATIONS   NOT  WAIVED.   To  the  fullest  extent
permitted by applicable  law, each Guarantor  waives  presentment  to, demand of
payment  from and protest to the  Borrower of any of the  Obligations,  and also
waives  notice  of  acceptance  of its  guarantee  and  notice  of  protest  for
nonpayment.  To the fullest extent  permitted by applicable law, the obligations
of each  Guarantor  hereunder  shall not be  affected  by (a) the failure of the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
or  exercise  any right or remedy  against the  Borrower or any other  Guarantor
under the  provisions  of the  Credit  Agreement,  any other  Loan  Document  or
otherwise,  (b) any rescission,  waiver,  amendment or  modification  of, or any
release from any of the terms or provisions of, this  Agreement,  any other Loan
Document or any other  agreement,  including with respect to any other Guarantor
under this Agreement, or (c) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or
the release of, any of the security  held by or on behalf of the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender.


<PAGE>

               SECTION 3.  SECURITY.  Each  of  the  Guarantors  authorizes  the
Administrative  Agent  and  each of the  Lenders,  from  time  to time at  their
discretion  and without  notice to  Guarantors  (but subject to the terms of the
other  Loan  Documents),  to take any or all of the  following  actions  without
impairing the Guarantors' obligations hereunder:  (a) retain or obtain a lien on
or security  interest in any  property to secure any of the  Obligations  or any
liability or obligation hereunder; (b) retain or obtain the primary or secondary
obligation  of any obligor or  obligors,  in addition  to the  Guarantors,  with
respect to any of the  Obligations;  (c) extend or renew for one or more periods
(regardless  of  whether  longer  than  the  original  period),  or  release  or
compromise any  obligation of the Guarantors  hereunder or any obligation of any
nature of any other obligor (including,  without limitation,  the Borrower) with
respect to any of the Obligations: (d) release or fail to perfect its lien on or
security interest in, or impair,  surrender,  release or permit any substitution
or exchange for, all or any part of any property securing any of the Obligations
or any  liability or  obligation  hereunder,  or extend or renew for one or more
periods  (regardless of whether  longer than the original  period) or release or
compromise any obligations of any nature of any obligor with respect to any such
property,  or apply any such  property  and  direct  the order or manner of sale
thereof  as they,  in their  sole  discretion,  may  determine;  (e)  release or
substitute any one or more endorsees,  other  guarantors of other obligors;  and
(f)  resort  to the  Guarantors,  or  either  of them,  for  payment  of any the
Obligations,  regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any other Person
shall have  resorted to any  property  securing  any of the  Obligations  or any
liability or obligation  hereunder or shall have proceeded  against the Borrower
or any other obligator primarily or secondarily obligated with respect to any of
the Obligations  (all of the actions referred to in this clause (f) being hereby
expressly waived by the Guarantors).

               SECTION 4.  GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT. Each  Guarantor  further agrees
that  its  guaranty  constitutes  a  guarantee  of  payment  when due and not of
collection,  and  waives  any  right to  require  that any  resort be had by the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender to any of the  security  held for payment of
the  Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books
of the Administrative  Agent or any Lender in favor of the Borrower or any other
Person.

               SECTION 5.  NO  DISCHARGE  OR   DIMINISHMENT  OF  GUARANTEE.  The
obligations of each Guarantor  hereunder  shall not be subject to any reduction,
limitation,   impairment  or   termination   for  any  reason  (other  than  the
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of
waiver, release, surrender,  alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations,
and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff,  counterclaim,  recoupment or
termination   whatsoever   by   reason   of  the   invalidity,   illegality   or
unenforceability   of  the  Obligations  or  otherwise.   Without  limiting  the
generality of the foregoing,  the obligations of each Guarantor  hereunder shall
not be  discharged  or  impaired  or  otherwise  affected  by the failure of the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any remedy  under the Credit  Agreement,  any other Loan  Document  or any other
agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any
default,  failure or delay,  willful or  otherwise,  in the  performance  of the
Obligations,  or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or
to the extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise  operate as
a  discharge  of each  Guarantor  as a matter of law or equity  (other  than the
indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).

               SECTION 6.  DEFENSES OF BORROWER  WAIVED.  To the fullest  extent
permitted by  applicable  law,  each  Guarantor  waives any defense  based on or
arising  out of any  defense  of the  Borrower  or the  unenforceability  of the
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause,  or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of the Borrower,  other than the final and indefeasible payment
in full in cash of the  Obligations.  The  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders
may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by
one or more  judicial or  nonjudicial  sales,  accept an  assignment of any such
security  in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  compromise  or  adjust  any  part  of  the
Obligations,  make any  other  accommodation  with  the  Borrower  or any  other
guarantor,  without  affecting  or  impairing  in any way the  liability  of any
Guarantor  hereunder  except to the  extent  the  Obligations  have been  fully,
finally  and  indefeasibly  paid in  cash.  Pursuant  to  applicable  law,  each
Guarantor  waives any defense  arising out of any such election even though such
election  operates,  pursuant to applicable  law, to impair or to extinguish any
right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor
against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or guarantor, as the case may be, or
any security.

               SECTION 7. AGREEMENT TO PAY; SUBORDINATION. In furtherance of the
foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent
or any Lender has at law or in equity  against any  Guarantor by virtue  hereof,
upon the failure of the  Borrower or any other Loan Party to pay any  Obligation
when


<PAGE>

and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity,  by  acceleration,  after
notice of prepayment or otherwise,  each Guarantor  hereby  promises to and will
forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative  Agent for the benefit
of the Lenders in cash the amount of such unpaid  Obligations.  Upon  payment by
any  Guarantor  of any sums to the  Administrative  Agent,  all  rights  of such
Guarantor  against the Borrower  arising as a result  thereof by way of right of
subrogation,  contribution,  reimbursement,  indemnity or otherwise shall in all
respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible
payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of
the Borrower now or hereafter  held by any Guarantor is hereby  subordinated  in
right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations. If any
amount  shall  erroneously  be paid to any  Guarantor  on  account  of (i)  such
subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any
such  indebtedness  of the Borrower,  such amount shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid
to  the  Administrative  Agent  to  be  credited  against  the  payment  of  the
Obligations,  whether matured or unmatured,  in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents.

               SECTION 8. INFORMATION. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility
for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's  financial condition and
assets,  and of all other  circumstances  bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the  Obligations  and the  nature,  scope  and  extent  of the  risks  that such
Guarantor   assumes  and  incurs   hereunder,   and  agrees  that  none  of  the
Administrative  Agent or the  Lenders  will have any duty to  advise  any of the
Guarantors  of   information   known  to  it  or  any  of  them  regarding  such
circumstances or risks.

               SECTION 9.   REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES.   Each   Guarantor
represents  and warrants as to itself that all  representations  and  warranties
relating to it contained in the Credit Agreement are true and correct.

               SECTION 10. TERMINATION.  The guarantees made hereunder (a) shall
terminate when all the Obligations  have been paid in full in cash and satisfied
and (b) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,  as the case may be, if
at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must
otherwise  be restored by any Lender or any  Guarantor  upon the  bankruptcy  or
reorganization of the Borrower,  any Guarantor or otherwise.  In connection with
the  foregoing,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  execute  and deliver to such
Guarantor or Guarantor's designee, at such Guarantor's expense, any documents or
instruments  which such Guarantor shall reasonably  request from time to time to
evidence such termination and release.

               SECTION 11.  BINDING   EFFECT;  SEVERAL  AGREEMENT;  ASSIGNMENTS.
Whenever  in this  Agreement  any of the  parties  hereto is  referred  to, such
reference  shall be deemed to include the  successors and assigns of such party;
and all  covenants,  promises and  agreements by or on behalf of the  Guarantors
that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each
party hereto and their respective  successors and assigns.  This Agreement shall
become  effective as to any  Guarantor  when a  counterpart  hereof  executed on
behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative  Agent,
and  a   counterpart   hereof  shall  have  been   executed  on  behalf  of  the
Administrative  Agent,  and thereafter  shall be binding upon such Guarantor and
the Administrative Agent and their respective  successors and assigns, and shall
inure  to the  benefit  of such  Guarantor,  the  Administrative  Agent  and the
Lenders, and their respective  successors and assigns,  except that no Guarantor
shall  have the  right to assign  its  rights or  obligations  hereunder  or any
interest  herein (and any such attempted  assignment  shall be void);  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that if ALLETE is a party to an  internal  reorganization  pursuant to
which all or  substantially  all of ALLETE'S  common stock is exchanged  for the
common stock of an entity that becomes  ALLETE'S  parent,  ALLETE may assign and
delegate  its rights and  obligations  under this  Guaranty to its new parent so
long as (a)  such  new  parent  is at  least  of the  same  credit  quality  (as
reasonably  determined  by the  Lenders)  as  ALLETE  immediately  prior to such
reorganization   and  (b)  such  new  parent   executes   and  delivers  to  the
Administrative  Agent such assumption  agreements,  certificates and opinions as
the  Administrative  Agent  reasonably  requests.  Upon any such  delegation and
assumption of obligations in accordance with the previous sentence,  ALLETE, but
not  ADESA,  shall be  relieved  of and fully  discharged  from all  obligations
hereunder,  whether such  obligations  arose before or after such delegation and
assumption.  This  Agreement  shall be  construed as a separate  agreement  with
respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented,  waived or
released  with  respect  to any  Guarantor  without  the  approval  of any other
Guarantor  and  without   affecting  the  obligations  of  any  other  Guarantor
hereunder.


<PAGE>

               SECTION 12. WAIVERS; AMENDMENT.

               (a)     No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent of any in
exercising any power or right hereunder  shall operate as a waiver thereof,  nor
shall  any  single  or  partial  exercise  of any such  right or  power,  or any
abandonment  or  discontinuance  of steps  to  enforce  such a right  or  power,
preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other
right or power. The rights and of the Administrative  Agent hereunder and of the
Lenders under the other Loan  Documents are  cumulative and are not exclusive of
any  rights  or  remedies  that  they  would  otherwise  have.  No waiver of any
provision  of this  Agreement  or  consent  to any  departure  by any  Guarantor
therefrom shall in any event be effective  unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver and consent shall be effective only in
the specific  instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand
on any  Guarantor  in any case  shall  entitle  such  Guarantor  to any other or
further notice in similar or other circumstances.

               (b)     Neither this Agreement nor any  provision  hereof  may be
waived,  amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into
between  the  Guarantors  with  respect  to  which  such  waiver,  amendment  or
modification  relates  and the  Administrative  Agent,  with the  prior  written
consent of the  Required  Lenders  (except as  otherwise  provided in the Credit
Agreement).

               SECTION 13.  GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA.

               SECTION 14. NOTICES.  All  communications  and notices  hereunder
shall be in  writing  and  given  as  provided  in  Section  10.1 of the  Credit
Agreement.  All  communications and notices hereunder to each Guarantor shall be
given to it at its address set forth in Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement.

               SECTION 15. SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY.

               (a)     All covenants, agreements  representations and warranties
made by the  Guarantors  herein  and in the  certificates  or other  instruments
prepared or delivered in  connection  with or pursuant to this  Agreement or the
other  Loan  Document  shall  be  considered  to have  been  relied  upon by the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall survive the making by the Lenders
of the Term  Loans  regardless  of any  investigation  made by any of them or on
their  behalf,  and  shall  continue  in full  force  and  effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Term Loan or any other fee or amount
payable  under this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document is  outstanding  and
unpaid.

               (b)     In  the event one or more of the provisions  contained in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any respect,  the validity,  legality and enforceability of the
remaining  provisions  contained  herein  and  therein  shall  not in any way be
affected  or impaired  thereby (it being  understood  that the  invalidity  of a
particular  provision  in a particular  jurisdiction  shall not in and of itself
affect the validity of such  provision in any other  jurisdiction).  The parties
shall  endeavor in good-faith  negotiations  to replace the invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable  provisions  with valid  provisions  the economic  effect of which
comes as close as  possible  to that of the  invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable
provisions.

               SECTION 16.  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement  may  be  executed in
counterparts,  each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall  constitute a single contract  (subject to Section 11), and
shall  become  effective  as  provided  in Section  11.  Delivery of an executed
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

               SECTION 17. RULES OF INTERPRETATION.  The rules of interpretation
specified in Section 1.03 of the Credit  Agreement  shall be  applicable to this
Agreement.

               SECTION 18. JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS.

               (a)  Each  Guarantor  hereby   irrevocably  and   unconditionally
submits,  for itself and its property,  to the nonexclusive  jurisdiction of any
Florida state court or Federal court of the United States of America

{OR641843;1}

<PAGE>

sitting in Orlando,  Florida,  and any appellate court from any thereof,  in any
action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the other
Loan Documents,  or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
in respect of any such action or proceeding  may be heard and determined in such
Florida state court or, to the extent  permitted by law, in such Federal  court.
Each of the parties  hereto  agrees that a final  judgment in any such action or
proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by
suit on the  judgment or in any other  manner  provided by law.  Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may
otherwise  have to bring any action or proceeding  relating to this Agreement or
the other Loan  Documents  against any Guarantor or its properties in the courts
of any jurisdiction.

               (b)     Each  Guarantor  hereby  irrevocably  and unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the other
Loan Documents in any Florida state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
hereby  irrevocably  waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient  forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

               (c)     Each  party  to  this  Agreement  irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner  provided for notices in Section 14. Nothing in

<TEXT>

                                                                   Exhibit 10(d)

                            BORROWER PROMISSORY NOTE



$28,373,000                                                        April 3, 2000

         ASSET HOLDINGS III, L.P., an Ohio limited partnership (the "Borrower"),
for value  received,  promises to pay to  CORNERSTONE  FUNDING  CORPORATION I, a
Delaware  corporation  (the  "Issuer"),  the sum of  TWENTY-EIGHT  MILLION THREE
HUNDRED  SEVENTY-THREE  THOUSAND and 00/100 DOLLARS ($28,373,000) and to pay (i)
interest on the unpaid  balance of such principal sum from and after the date of
this Borrower  Promissory  Note at the interest rate or interest  rates borne by
the Issuer's Floating Rate Notes, Series 2000A in the aggregate principal amount
of $28,373,000 (the "Notes") and (ii) interest on overdue principal,  and to the
extent  permitted by law, on overdue  interest,  at the interest  rate  provided
under the terms of the Notes.

         This Borrower  Promissory Note (the "Borrower  Note") has been executed
and delivered by the Borrower pursuant to a certain Participation Agreement (the
"Agreement"),  dated as of March 31, 2000, among Borrower, ADESA Corporation, an
Indiana  corporation  (the  "Lessee"),  SunTrust  Bank,  a  banking  corporation
organized  and  existing  under the laws of the State of  Georgia  (the  "Credit
Bank"),  and the  Issuer.  Terms  used but not  defined  herein  shall  have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agreement and the Note Indenture.

         Pursuant to the  Agreement,  the Issuer has made a loan (the "Loan") to
the  Borrower of the proceeds  from the  issuance  and sale of the Notes,  to be
applied to assist the Borrower in refinancing certain  indebtedness  incurred by
the Borrower to pay the cost of acquiring  certain  real  property  (the "Leased
Property") which will be owned by the Borrower and leased to the Lessee,  and to
pay additional  Property Costs related to the  transactions  contemplated by the
Agreement.

         The Borrower has agreed,  and hereby does agree,  to repay such loan by
making payments  hereunder ("Loan Payments") at the times and in the amounts set
forth in this Borrower Note. The Notes have been issued,  concurrently  with the
execution and delivery of this Borrower  Note,  pursuant to, and are secured by,
the Master Trust Indenture (the "Master  Indenture") dated as of March 31, 2000,
between  the  Issuer  and  the  Note  Trustee  as   supplemented  by  the  First
Supplemental  Series Indenture  between the Issuer and the Note Trustee dated as
of March 31, 2000 (the  "Supplemental  Indenture" and,  together with the Master
Indenture, the "Indenture").

         To provide  funds to pay the Debt Service on the Notes as and when due,
or to reimburse the Credit Bank for Drawings  under the Letter of Credit used to
make such payments,  the Borrower  hereby agrees to and shall make Loan Payments
as follows:  on each  Interest  Payment Date the amount equal to interest due on
the Notes on such Interest  Payment Date,  and on each Interest  Payment Date on
which principal of the Notes shall be due and payable pursuant to the redemption
provisions of the Note Indenture, or upon maturity of the Notes, an amount equal
to such principal due and payable on such date. In addition, to provide funds to
pay the  Debt  Service  on the  Notes as and when  due at any  other  time,  the
Borrower  hereby  agrees to and shall  make Loan  Payments  on any other date on
which any Debt Service on the Notes shall be due and

<PAGE>
payable,  whether upon  acceleration,  call for redemption or otherwise,  in the
amount of the Debt Service so due and payable.

         If payment or provision for payment in accordance with the Indenture is
made in respect of the Debt  Service  on the Notes from  moneys  other than Loan
Payments,  this  Note  shall be  deemed  paid to the  extent  such  payments  or
provisions  for  payment of Debt  Service  have been made.  The  Borrower  shall
receive a credit against its  obligation to make Loan Payments  hereunder to the
extent of the moneys  delivered  to the Note  Trustee  under and pursuant to the
Letter of Credit  for the  payment  of Debt  Service  and any other  amounts  on
deposit in the Note Fund and available to pay Debt Service on the Notes pursuant
to the Indenture.  Subject to the  foregoing,  all Loan Payments shall be in the
full amount required hereunder.

         All Loan Payments shall be payable in lawful money of the United States
of  America,  in  immediately  available  funds,  and  shall be made to the Note
Trustee at its  Operations  Office (as defined in the Indenture) for the account
of the Issuer, deposited in the Note Fund and used as provided in the Indenture.

         All  parties  hereto,  whether  as  makers,  endorsers,  or  otherwise,
severally  waive  presentment  for  payment,  demand,  protest,  and  notice  of
dishonor, notice of intention to accelerate,  notice of acceleration,  notice of
the existence, creation or nonpayment of all or any of the Loan Advances and all
other notices whatsoever.

         ALL PAYMENTS TO BE MADE BY THE BORROWER IN RESPECT OF THE LOAN AND THIS
BORROWER NOTE SHALL BE MADE ONLY FROM CERTAIN PAYMENTS  RECEIVED UNDER THE LEASE
AND  CERTAIN  PROCEEDS  OF THE LEASED  PROPERTY  AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
CREDIT BANK SHALL HAVE  RECEIVED  SUFFICIENT  PAYMENTS FROM SUCH SOURCES TO MAKE
PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT  LIABILITIES IN ACCORDANCE  WITH AND
SUBJECT  TO THE  PRIORITIES  SET  FORTH  IN  ARTICLE  III  OF THE  REIMBURSEMENT
AGREEMENT.  THE ISSUER, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF AGREES THAT IT WILL LOOK SOLELY
TO SUCH  SOURCES  OF PAYMENT TO THE EXTENT  AVAILABLE  FOR  DISTRIBUTION  TO THE
ISSUER OR THE NOTE TRUSTEE AS PROVIDED IN THE  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT AND THAT
NEITHER THE BORROWER NOR ITS RESPECTIVE  PARTNERS,  NOR ANY OF THEIR  RESPECTIVE
ORGANIZERS,  INCORPORATORS,  LIMITED OR GENERAL PARTNERS, MEMBERS, STOCKHOLDERS,
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY,  THE "BORROWER
PARTIES")  SHALL BE  PERSONALLY  LIABLE TO THE ISSUER OR THE CREDIT BANK FOR ANY
AMOUNT PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT.  NOTHING IN THIS
BORROWER NOTE, THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT SHALL
BE CONSTRUED AS CREATING ANY LIABILITY  (OTHER THAN FOR WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT)  OF
THE  BORROWER  TO PAY ANY SUM OR TO  PERFORM  ANY  COVENANT,  EITHER  EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED,  IN THIS  BORROWER  NOTE,  THE  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT  OR ANY  OTHER
OPERATIVE  DOCUMENT (ALL SUCH LIABILITY,  IF ANY, BEING EXPRESSLY  WAIVED BY THE
ISSUER BY ITS ACCEPTANCE  HEREOF AND BY THE CREDIT BANK BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE
ASSIGNMENT HEREOF) AND THAT THE ISSUER, THE CREDIT BANK AND EACH OTHER HOLDER OF
THIS  BORROWER  NOTE,  BY ITS  ACCEPTANCE  HEREOF,  ON BEHALF OF ITSELF  AND ITS
SUCCESSORS  AND  ASSIGNS,  AGREES IN THE CASE OF ANY  LIABILITY  OF THE BORROWER
HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER  (EXCEPT FOR SUCH LIABILITY  ATTRIBUTABLE  TO BORROWER'S
WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT) THAT IT WILL LOOK SOLELY TO THOSE CERTAIN PAYMENTS RECEIVED
UNDER THE LEASE AND THOSE CERTAIN PROCEEDS OF THE LEASED PROPERTY AS PROVIDED IN
ARTICLE III OF THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE BORROWER
(BUT NOT ITS PARTNERS, THE ISSUER OR CORNERSTONE CAPITAL CORPORATION,  OR ANY OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE ORGANIZERS,

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

INCORPORATORS,  STOCKHOLDERS, PARTNERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
OFFICERS  AND  AGENTS)  SHALL IN ANY EVENT BE  LIABLE  WITH  RESPECT  TO (I) THE
REMOVAL OF BORROWER'S LIENS OR LIABILITIES  INVOLVING ITS WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT OR
(II) FAILURE TO TURN OVER PAYMENTS THE BORROWER HAS RECEIVED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH
ARTICLE III OF THE  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT;  AND  PROVIDED,  FURTHER  THAT THE
FOREGOING  EXCULPATION  OF THE BORROWER AND THE  BORROWER  PARTIES  SHALL NOT BE
DEEMED TO BE EXCULPATIONS OF THE LESSEE, THE GUARANTOR OR ANY OTHER PERSON.

         Any provision to the contrary contained in this Borrower Note or in any
of the other Operative Documents notwithstanding,  it is expressly provided that
in no case or event  shall the  aggregate  of (i) all  Interest  payable  by the
Lessor and (ii) the aggregate of any other  amounts  accrued or paid pursuant to
this  Borrower  Note  or any of  the  other  Operative  Documents,  which  under
applicable  laws are or may be deemed to  constitute  interest,  ever exceed the
maximum rate of interest  which could  lawfully be  contracted  for,  charged or
received.  In this connection,  it is expressly stipulated and agreed that it is
the intent of the Borrower and the Issuer to contract in strict  compliance with
the  applicable  usury  laws of the State and of the  United  States  (whichever
permit the higher rate of interest) from time to time in effect.  In furtherance
thereof,  none of the terms of this Borrower Note or any of the other  Operative
Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as  consideration
for the use, forbearance or detention of money,  interest at a rate in excess of
the maximum  contract  interest rate permitted to be contracted for,  charged or
received by the  applicable  laws of the United  States or the State  (whichever
permit the higher rate of  interest).  The Borrower and any other parties now or
hereafter  becoming liable for payment of any  indebtedness  under this Borrower
Note or any other  Operative  Documents  shall  never be liable for  interest in
excess of the maximum rate that may be lawfully  contracted for or charged under
the laws of the State and of the United States (whichever permit the higher rate
of interest).  If under any  circumstances  the  aggregate  amounts paid include
amounts which by law are deemed  interest  which would exceed the maximum amount
of interest which could lawfully have been contracted for,  charged or received,
the parties  stipulate  that such  amounts will be deemed to have been paid as a
result  of an error on the part of the  parties,  and the party  receiving  such
excess  payment  shall  promptly,  upon  discovery  of such error or upon notice
thereof from the party making such payment,  refund the amount of such excess or
at the option of the Issuer or then holder of this  Borrower  Note,  credit such
excess  against  any unpaid  principal  balance  owing.  To the  maximum  extent
permitted by applicable law, all amounts contracted for, charged or received for
the use,  forbearance,  or detention of money shall, to the extent  permitted by
applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full
term of this Borrower Note.

         This  Borrower  Note shall be governed by and  construed in  accordance
with  the  laws of the  State  of  Ohio,  without  regard  to  conflicts  of law
principles.

         This Borrower Note is subject to optional,  extraordinary  optional and
mandatory  prepayment,  in whole or in part, at the times and upon the terms and
conditions for optional,  extraordinary optional and mandatory redemption of the
Notes as set forth in the  Indenture.  Any  optional or  extraordinary  optional
prepayment  is also  subject  to  satisfaction,  upon  the  same  terms,  of any
applicable notice,  deposit or other requirements which apply to the optional or
extraordinary optional redemption of the Notes as set forth in the Indenture.

                                      -3-
