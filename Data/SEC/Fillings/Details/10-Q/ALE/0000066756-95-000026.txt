Note 3. Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. 
Under the terms of the contract which extends through 2007, the Company is 
purchasing 71 percent of the output from a generating plant which is capable of 
generating up to 455 MW. Reductions to about 49 percent of the output are 
provided for in the contract and, at the option of Square Butte, could begin 
after a five-year advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power and energy is a proportionate share of Square Butte's 
fixed obligations and variable operating costs, based on the percentage of the 
total output purchased by the Company. The annual fixed obligations of the 
Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1995 through 1999. The variable 
operating costs are not incurred unless production takes place. The Company is 
responsible for paying all costs and expenses of Square Butte if not paid by 
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company 
are absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered 
to the Company.

In March 1995 based on the results of a project which analyzed the economic 
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the 
board of directors of Lehigh directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of 
Lehigh's assets in a manner that would maximize utilization of tax benefits. 
With this new directive in place, Lehigh recognized $18.4 million of income in 
the first quarter of 1995 by reducing a portion of the valuation reserve that 
offsets the deferred tax assets. The Company's portion of that income is $14.7 
million, or 52 cents per share.



Note 6. Subsequent Event

On May 8, 1995, the Company and Pentair, Inc. signed definitive agreements with 
Consolidated Papers, Inc. to sell their interests in LSPI and SRFI for 
approximately $183 million in cash, plus CPI's assumption of debt and lease 
obligations. CPI will also indemnify the Company and Pentair, Inc. for any 
future liability under LSPI's lease payment guarantees discussed in note 4. The 
Company's portion of the proceeds is approximately $112 million. The sale price 
is subject to adjustment for changes in net book value from December 31, 1994, 
to closing. The transaction is expected to close in late June 1995, and is 
conditioned on regulatory clearance, satisfactory completion of further 
environmental due diligence, closing of the sale by Pentair, Inc. of its 
Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corporation to CPI, and other customary conditions. 
The exit from the paper and pulp business is expected to have an immaterial 
impact on 1995 financial results for the Company.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
          Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota Power has operations in three business areas: (1) electric utility 
operations, which include electric, gas and coal mining operations; (2) water 
utility operations, which include water, wastewater and sanitation operations; 
and (3) investments and corporate services, which include investments in 
securities, a financial guaranty reinsurance company, a real estate company in 
Florida, paper and pulp production, and manufacturing of truck-mounted lifting 
equipment. The pending $167 million acquisition of ADESA is expected to be 
completed in mid 1995 and, when completed, the auto redistribution business 
will be part of investments and corporate services.

On April 17, 1995, a Minnesota businessman agreed to purchase Reach All, the 
truck-mounted lifting equipment manufacturing partnership owned 82.5 percent by 
UtilEquip Incorporated, a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction is 
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1995, and is conditioned on 
the purchaser's completion of due diligence and finalization of financing 
arrangements.

On May 8, 1995, the Company and Pentair, Inc. signed definitive agreements with 
Consolidated Papers, Inc. to sell their interests in LSPI and SRFI for 
approximately $183 million in cash, plus CPI's assumption of debt and lease 
obligations. CPI will also indemnify the Company and Pentair, Inc. for any 
future liability under LSPI's lease payment guarantees discussed in note 4. The 
Company's portion of the proceeds is approximately $112 million. The sale price 
is subject to adjustment for changes in net book value from December 31, 1994, 
to closing. The transaction is expected to close in late June 1995, and is 
conditioned on regulatory clearance, satisfactory completion of further 
environmental due diligence, closing of the sale by Pentair, Inc. of its 
Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corporation to CPI, and other customary conditions. 
The exit from the paper and pulp business is expected to have an immaterial 
impact on 1995 financial results for the Company.

Earnings per share of common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 1995, were 
87 cents compared to 30 cents for the quarter ended March 31, 1994. The most 
significant factor contributing to the higher earnings in 1995 was the 
recognition of tax benefits associated with Lehigh which contributed 52 cents 
to earnings per share. Earnings in 1995 also reflect the improved performance 
of the Company's securities portfolio, higher paper and pulp prices, and 
increased electric sales to industrial customers offset in part by lower water 
consumption levels at SSU and an 18 cent per share provision associated with 
exiting the truck-mounted lifting equipment business. Earnings in 1994 include 
13 cents per share from the recognition of escrow funds associated with Lehigh 
and a 21 cent per share write off of an investment.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Quarter Ended March 31, 1995 and 1994.

Electric utility operations.  Income from the electric utility operations was 
higher in 1995 compared to 1994 due to interim rates in effect since March 1, 
1994, and an overall increase in electric sales of 2 percent. Kilowatt-hour 
sales to industrial customers increased 10 percent due to National resuming 
operations in August 1994. Coal operations contributed income of $661,000 in 
1995 and $579,000 in 1994 to electric utility operations.

Revenue from electric sales to taconite customers accounted for 37 percent of 
revenue and income from electric operations in 1995 compared to 32 percent in 
1994. Revenue from electric sales to paper and other wood-products companies 
accounted for 13 percent of revenue and income from electric operations in 1995 
and in 1994. 

Water utility operations.  Income from water utility operations was down in 
1995 due in part to reduced irrigation demand and the December 1994 sale of 
SSU's Venice Gardens assets. It is expected that the loss of customers as a 
result of the Venice Gardens transaction will be offset when the purchase of 
Orange Osceola Utilities, Inc. is completed in the third quarter of 1995. 

Investments and corporate services.  Earnings from investments and corporate 
services were higher in 1995 primarily due to the recognition of $18.4 million 
of tax benefits by Lehigh, the Company's real estate business. In March 1995 
based on the results of a project which analyzed the economic feasibility of 
realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board of directors 
of Lehigh directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's assets in a 
manner that would maximize utilization of tax benefits. The Company's portion 
of the tax benefits reflected as income is $14.7 million, or 52 cents per 
share. Earnings in 1994 include 13 cents per share from the recognition of 
escrow funds associated with Lehigh.

Higher paper and pulp prices also increased earnings in 1995. Pretax income 
from LSPI was $1,594,000 in 1995 compared to $452,000 in 1994. Pulp production 
contributed $779,000 to net income in 1995 compared to a $322,000 loss in 1994. 

The performance of the Company's securities portfolio improved significantly 
over 1994 due to improved market conditions. In the first quarter of 1994 the 
Company wrote off a $10.1 million investment. In March 1995, the Company 
recorded a $5 million provision, lowering earnings per share by 18 cents in 
anticipation of exiting Reach All. On April 17, 1995, the Company entered into 
an agreement for the sale of this business to a Minnesota businessman. The 
transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1995.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Reference is made to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three 
months ended March 31, 1995 and 1994, for purposes of the following discussion.

Cash flow activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number 
of factors representative of normal operations. Cash used for investing 
activities decreased $10.2 million because a portion of the securities 
portfolio was liquidated in anticipation of the ADESA acquisition. Cash used 
for financing activities increased $13.2 million due to the payment of notes 
payable outstanding at December 31, 1994.

Working capital, if and when needed, generally is provided by the sale of 
commercial paper. In addition, securities investments can be liquidated to 
provide funds for reinvestment in existing 

                              - 8 -
<PAGE>
businesses or acquisition of new businesses, and approximately 900,000 
original issue shares of common stock are available for issuance through the 
DRIP.

Proceeds from the pending sale of the paper and pulp businesses, combined with 
funds from the sale of a portion of the securities investment portfolio, are 
expected to fund the ADESA purchase in mid 1995.

Capital requirements.  Consolidated capital expenditures for the three months 
ended March 31, 1995, totaled $13.7 million. These expenditures include $9.7 
million for electric utility operations, of which $500,000 was for coal 
operations, $3.8 million for water utility operations and $200,000 for the pulp 
production plant. Internally generated funds were the primary source for 
funding these expenditures.

On April 17, 1995, the Company and LTV Steel Mining Company (LTV) signed a 
capacity purchase agreement and an amendment to their Electric Service and 
Interconnection Agreement providing for a new five year shared reserves 
arrangement. The capacity purchase  agreement and the amendment will enable the 
Company to add to its capacity 210 MW generated from three of LTV's generating 
units with the understanding that the Company will provide LTV's entire 130 MW 
load on a stand-by basis. Of the remaining 80 MW, 60 MW will be used to meet 
the Company's needs and 20 MW will be kept in reserve as required by the Mid-
Continent Area Power Pool. The Company will also receive about $500,000 per 
year for providing related control area services. The amendment, which is 
expected to be effective retroactive to May 1, 1995, and continue through April 
30, 2000, is subject to MPUC approval. LTV will file the capacity agreement 
addressing the Company's purchase of LTV's 210 MW of generating capacity with 
the FERC for its approval.

The original St. Louis River Project license expired December 31, 1993, and the 
Company is currently operating the project under an annual license until the 
FERC issues a new license. As a precursor to the issuance of the new license, 
the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for this project was released 
by the FERC in February 1995. In a filing with the FERC on April 17, 1995, the 
Company identified deficiencies in the FEIS pertaining to the incremental 
economic impact that the FEIS recommendations would have upon the project 
economics. A final license is expected to be issued during 1995. Depending on 
the terms of the final license, the Company, and any other interested party, 
may pursue reconsideration of the license under procedures established pursuant 
to federal regulations.

Ref. Page 8. - Insert after First Paragraph

On March 29, 1995, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on 
Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities and 
Transmitting Utilities (FERC Docket No. RM95-8-000) and a supplemental NOPR on 
Recovery of Stranded Costs (FERC Docket No. RM94-7-001).

The rules proposed in the NOPR are intended to facilitate competition among 
generators for sales to the bulk power supply market. If adopted, the NOPR on 
open access transmission would require public utilities under the Federal Power 
Act to provide open access to their transmission systems and would establish 
guidelines for their doing so. Previously, the FERC had not imposed on 
utilities a general obligation to provide access to their transmission systems. 
This open access regime would require utilities to file tariffs that provide 
for point-to-point and network transmission services, including ancillary 
services. All public utilities would provide such services pursuant to a 
generic set of transmission tariff terms and conditions established in the 
rulemaking proceeding. Thus, a final rule would define the terms under which 
independent power producers, neighboring utilities, and others could gain 
access to a utility's transmission grid to deliver power to wholesale 
customers, such as municipal distribution systems, rural electric cooperatives, 
or other utilities. Under the NOPR, each public utility would also be required 
to establish separate rates for its transmission and generation services for 
new wholesale services, and to take transmission services (including ancillary 
services) under the same tariffs that would be applicable to third-party users 
for all of its new wholesale sales and purchases of energy.

The supplemental NOPR on stranded costs provided a basis for recovery by 
regulated public utilities of legitimate and verifiable stranded costs 
associated with existing wholesale requirements customers and retail customers 
who become unbundled wholesale transmission customers of the utility. The FERC 
would provide public utilities a mechanism for recovery of stranded costs that 
result from municipalization, former retail customers becoming wholesale 
customers, or the loss of a wholesale customer. The FERC will consider allowing 
recovery of stranded investment costs associated with retail wheeling only if a 
state regulatory commission lacks the authority to consider that issue.

The Company is currently evaluating the NOPR to determine its impact on the 
Company and its customers. However, the impact is not expected to be material 
since the Company has generally adopted the open access policies proposed in 
the NOPR. Comments on the open-access NOPR are due August 7, 1995. It is 
anticipated that a final rule could take effect in early 1996. The Company 
cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

On April 13, 1995, the MPUC issued an order denying approval of the economic 
development rate. The MPUC is allowing the Company to refile this request after 
making several modifications to address the MPUC's concerns relating primarily 
to potential discriminatory impact, cost recovery and future ratemaking 
treatment. The Company is currently considering the MPUC's concerns and has not 
decided whether it will refile this request with the MPUC.

Early Retirement Plan

In April 1995 the Company offered an early retirement plan to 124 electric 
utility employees age 55 or older with 10 or more years of service. The offer 
is open until June 15, 1995, and those employees who accept it must retire by 
June 30. The Company estimates that the plan will cost from $6 to $8 million, 
which will be deferred and expensed over the next 2 to 3 years.

In response to EPA Region V's request for utilities to participate in their 
Great Lakes Initiative by voluntarily removing remaining polychlorinated 
biphenyl (PCB) inventories, the Company is scheduling replacement of PCB-
contaminated oil from substation equipment by 1998 and removal of PCB 
capacitors by 2004. The total cost is expected to be between $1.5 and $2 
million.

In January 1995 the FPSC approved the transfer to SSU of  water and wastewater 
facilities serving the communities of Lakeside and Spring Gardens in Citrus 
County, Florida, and Valencia Terrace in Lake County, Florida. The transfers 
were finalized in March 1995 adding 1,270 customers to SSU's existing customer 
base for a combined purchase price of approximately $500,000.

On April 6, 1995, Florida's First District Court of Appeals issued a decision 
reversing a 1993 FPSC order which approved uniform rates for 127 of the 
approximate 150 water and wastewater treatment facilities owned by SSU. The 
decision resulted from appeals filed with Florida's First District Court of 
Appeals by Citrus County and a homeowners' group in SSU's Sugarmill Woods 
service area. In addition, Florida's Office of Public Counsel had appealed the 
FPSC's decision to permit SSU's shareholders to retain the gain realized from 
the condemnation of SSU's St. Augustine Shores facilities in St. Johns County, 
Florida. The Court of Appeals affirmed the FPSC's decision to permit SSU's 
shareholders to retain the gain realized from the condemnation.

On April 21, 1995, SSU filed a motion for rehearing of the reversal of the 
uniform rate structure as well as a motion for certification of the uniform 
rate issue to the Supreme Court of Florida. The FPSC also filed a motion for 
rehearing of the rate structure issue. The FPSC has not provided any guidance 
regarding the impact of the reversal of the uniform rate structure. SSU 
believes that it will not be subject to refund liability if the FPSC's rate 
structure is not ultimately affirmed on appeal because, among other reasons, 
the rate structure issue is a revenue neutral issue.

On April 17, 1995, a Minnesota businessman agreed to purchase Reach All, the 
truck-mounted lifting equipment manufacturing partnership owned 82.5 percent by 
UtilEquip Incorporated, a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction is 
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1995, and is conditioned on 
the purchaser's completion of due diligence and finalization of financing 
arrangements. In anticipation of exiting this business, the Company recorded a 
$5 million provision, lowering earnings per share of common stock by 18 cents 
in March 1995.

On May 8, 1995, the Company and Pentair, Inc. signed definitive agreements with 
Consolidated Papers, Inc. to sell their interests in LSPI and SRFI for 
approximately $183 million in cash, plus CPI's assumption of debt and lease 
obligations. CPI will also indemnify the Company and Pentair, Inc. for any 
future liability under LSPI's lease payment guarantees discussed in note 4. The 
Company's portion of the proceeds is approximately $112 million. The sale price 
is subject to adjustment for changes in net book value from December 31, 1994, 
to closing. The transaction is expected to close in late June 1995, and is 
conditioned on regulatory clearance, satisfactory completion of further 
environmental due diligence, closing of the sale by Pentair, Inc. of its 
Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corporation to CPI, and other customary conditions. 
The exit from the paper and pulp business is expected to have an immaterial 
impact on 1995 financial results for the Company.

                              MINNESOTA POWER
                            Director Stock Plan

I.   Purpose

     The purpose of the Minnesota Power Director Stock Plan is to provide 
ownership of the Company's stock to members of the Board of Directors in 
order to improve the Company's ability to attract and retain highly qualified 
individuals to serve as directors of the Company and to strengthen the 
commonality of interest between directors and shareholders.

II.  Definitions

     When used herein, the following terms shall have the respective meanings

Directors (exclusive of any per meeting fees or expense reimbursements).

"Board" or "Board of Directors" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

"Committee" means a committee whose members meet the requirements of Section 
IV(A) hereof, and who are appointed from time to time by the Board to 
administer the Plan.

"Common Stock" means the common stock, no par value, of the Company.

"Company" means Minnesota Power & Light Company, a Minnesota corporation, and 
any successor corporation.

"Director" or "Participant" means any person who is elected or appointed to 
the Board of Directors of the Company and who is not an Employee.

III. Shares of Common Stock Subject to the Plan

     Subject to Section VII below, the maximum aggregate number of 
shares of Common Stock that may be delivered under the Plan is 250,000 
shares. The Common Stock to be delivered under the Plan will be made 
available from authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, or shares of 
Common Stock purchased on the open market and held by the Committee.

IV.  Administration

     A.   The Plan will be administered by a Committee appointed by the 
          Board, consisting of three or more persons who are not eligible to 
          participate in the Plan. Members of the Committee need not be 
          members of the Board. The Company shall pay all costs of 
          administration of the Plan.

     B.   Subject to and not inconsistent with the express provisions of the 
          Plan, the Committee has and may exercise such powers and authority 
          of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate for the Committee to 
          carry out its functions under the Plan. Without limiting the 
          generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall have full power and 
          authority (i) to determine all questions of fact that may arise 
          under the Plan, (ii) to interpret the Plan and to make all other 
          determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 
          Plan, and (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and 
          regulations relating to the Plan, including, without limitation, any 
          rules which the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to 
          ensure that the Company and the Plan will be able to comply with all 
          applicable provisions of any federal, state or local law. All 

<PAGE>
Minnesota Power
Director Stock Plan
Page 3

          interpretations, determinations and actions by the Committee will be 
          final and binding upon all persons, including the Company, and the 
          Participants.

V.   Determination of Annual Retainer and Stock Payments

     A.   The Board shall determine the Annual Retainer payable to all  
          Directors of the Company.

     B.   Each Director shall receive on the first business day following the 
          Effective Date, and on each January 31 thereafter (or on the first 
          business day thereafter if January 31 is not a business day) a Stock 
          Payment of 500 shares of Common Stock as a portion of the Annual 
          Retainer payable to such Director for the Plan Year in which such 
          date occurs. The cash portion of the Annual Retainer for such Plan 
          Year shall be paid to Directors at such times and in such manner as 
          may be determined by the Board of Directors. Directors joining the 
          Board during the Plan Year after January 31 will receive their Stock 
          Payment of 500 shares of Common Stock on the first business day 
          following the effective date of their election or appointment to the 
          Board.

     C.   Any Director may decline a Stock Payment for any Plan Year; 
          provided, however, that no cash compensation shall be paid in lieu 
          thereof. Any Director who declines a Stock Payment must do so in 
          writing prior to the performance of any services as a  Director for 
          the Plan Year to which such Stock Payment relates.

     D.   No Director shall be required to forfeit or otherwise return any 
          shares of Common Stock issued as a Stock Payment pursuant to the 
          Plan (including any shares of Common Stock received as a result of 
          an election under Section VI) notwithstanding any change in status 
          of such Director which renders him ineligible to continue as a 
          Participant in the Plan.

VI.  Election to Increase Amount of Stock Payment

     For any Plan Year, a Participant may make a written election to 
reduce the cash portion of the Annual Retainer by a specified dollar amount 
and have such amount applied to purchase additional shares of Common Stock of 
the Company. The election shall be made on a form provided by the Committee 
and must be returned to the Committee no later than six months prior to the 
applicable Plan Year. The election form shall state the amount by which the 
Participant desires to reduce the cash portion of the Annual Retainer, which 
shall be applied toward the purchase of Common Stock to be delivered on the 
same date that the Stock Payment is made; provided, however, that no 
fractional shares may be purchased. Cash in lieu of any fractional share 
shall be paid to the 

<PAGE>
Minnesota Power
Director Stock Plan
Page 4

Participant. An election shall continue in effect until changed or revoked by 
the Participant. No Participant shall be allowed to change or revoke any 
election for the then current year.

VII. Adjustment for Changes in Capitalization
     If the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company are 
increased, decreased, or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares 
or other securities, or if additional shares or new or different shares or 
other securities are distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock 
or other securities, through merger, consolidation, sale of all or 
substantially all of the property of the Company, reorganization or 
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse 
stock split, combinations of shares, rights offering, distribution of assets 
or other distribution with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other 
securities or other change in the corporate structure or shares of Common 
Stock, the number of shares to be granted annually, the maximum number of 
shares and/or the kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan shall be 
appropriately adjusted by the Committee. Any determination by the Committee 
as to any such adjustment will be final, binding, and conclusive. The maximum 
number of shares issuable under the Plan as a result of any such adjustment 
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.

VIII.     Amendment and Termination of Plan
     A.   The Board will have the power, in its discretion, to amend, suspend 
          or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no 
          amendment which requires shareholder approval in order for the Plan 
          to continue to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, 
          including any successor to such Rule, shall be effective unless such 
          amendment shall be approved by the requisite vote of the 
          shareholders of the Company entitled to vote thereon.

     B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of the Plan that 
          either states the amount and price of securities to be issued under 
          the Plan and specifies the price and timing of such issuances, or 
          sets forth a formula that determines the amount, price, and timing 
          of such issuances, shall not be amended more than once every six 
          months, other than to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue 
          Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules 
          thereunder.

IX.  Effective Date and Duration of the Plan

     The Plan will become effective upon the Effective Date, and shall 
remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board of Directors to terminate 
the Plan at any time pursuant to Section VIII, until all shares 

<PAGE>
Minnesota Power
Director Stock Plan
Page 5

subject to the Plan have been purchased or acquired according to the Plan's 
provisions.

X.   Miscellaneous Provisions

     A.   Continuation of Directors in Same Status

     Nothing in the Plan or any action taken pursuant to the Plan shall be 
construed as creating or constituting evidence of any agreement or 
understanding, express or implied, that the Company will retain a Director as 
a director or in any other capacity for any period of time or at a particular 
retainer or other rate of compensation, as conferring upon any Participant 
any legal or other right to continue as a director or in any other capacity, 
or as limiting, interfering with or otherwise affecting the right of the 
Company to terminate a Participant in his capacity as a director or otherwise 
at any time for any reason, with or without cause, and without regard to the 
effect that such termination might have upon him as a Participant under the 
Plan.

     B.   Compliance with Government Regulations

     Neither the Plan nor the Company shall be obligated to issue any shares 
of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan at any time unless and until all 
applicable requirements imposed by any federal and state securities and other 
laws, rules and regulations, by any regulatory agencies or by any stock 
exchanges upon which the Common Stock may be listed have been fully met. As a 
condition precedent to any issuance of shares of Common Stock and delivery of 
certificates evidencing such shares pursuant to the Plan, the Board or the 
Committee may require a Participant to take any such action and to make any 
such covenants, agreements, and representations as the Board or the Committee, 
as the case may be, in its discretion deems necessary or advisable to ensure 
compliance with such requirements. The Company shall in no event be obligated 
to register the shares of Common Stock deliverable under the Plan pursuant to 
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify or register such shares 
under any securities laws of any state upon their issuance under the Plan or at 
any time thereafter, or to take any other action in order to cause the issuance 
and delivery of such shares under the Plan or any subsequent offer, sale, or 
other transfer of such shares to comply with any such law, regulation, or 
requirement. Participants are responsible for complying with all applicable 
federal and state securities and other laws, rules, and regulations in 
connection with any offer, sale, or other transfer of the shares of Common 
Stock issued under the Plan or any interest therein including, without 
limitation, compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities 
Act of 1933 as amended (unless an exception therefrom is available) or with 
the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated thereunder, if applicable, or any 
successor

<PAGE>
Minnesota Power
Director Stock Plan
Page 6

provisions. Certificates for shares of Common Stock may be legended 
as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

     C.   Nontransferability of Rights

     No Participant shall have the right to assign the right to receive any 
Stock Payment or any other right or interest under the Plan, contingent or 
otherwise, or to cause or permit any encumbrance, pledge, or charge of any 
nature to be imposed on any such Stock Payment (prior to the issuance of stock 
certificates evidencing such Stock Payment) or any such right or interest.

     D.   Severability

     In the event that any provision of the Plan is held invalid, void, or 
unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the 
validity of any other provision of the Plan.

     E.   Governing Law

     To the extent not preempted by federal law, the Plan shall be governed 
by the laws of the state of Minnesota.
