in which the Company  currently  reports  information  regarding its businesses.

Note 2.   Regulatory Matters


FPSC Refund Order in  Connection  with 1993 Rate Case. On June 11, 1996 the FPSC
voted 3-2 to require SSU to refund about $10  million,  including  interest,  to
certain  customers who had paid more to SSU under a uniform rate  structure than
they  would  have paid  under a  stand-alone  rate  structure  during the period
September  1993  to  January  1996.  In so  ruling,  the  majority  of the  FPSC
determined  that a February  1996  decision of the Florida  Supreme Court in GTE
Florida v. FPSC did not render a refund requirement  unlawful  independent of an
offsetting surcharge.  SSU believes that the GTE Florida decision  substantiates
SSU's claim that it would be unlawful  for the FPSC to order a refund to certain
customers  who paid more under  uniform  rates  without also  permitting  SSU to
recover  the refund  amount  from  remaining  customers  who paid less.  SSU has
recorded no provision for refund.  SSU intends to appeal the FPSC's order to the
First District Court of Appeal.

SSU's 1995 Rate Case. On July 31, 1996 the FPSC voted to allow SSU approximately
61 percent of the $18.1 million rate increase  requested in June 1995.  The FPSC
is expected to issue its final order on SSU's request on September 4, 1996.

In March 1995 based on the  results of a project  which  analyzed  the  economic
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board
of directors of Lehigh  directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's
assets in a manner that would  maximize  utilization  of tax benefits.  Based on
this directive,  Lehigh  recognized $18.4 million of income in the first quarter
of 1995 by reducing the valuation  reserve which offsets deferred tax assets. In
May 1996 an additional $2 million of income was recognized based on a management
review of the  appropriateness of the valuation reserve.  Additional  unrealized
net deferred tax assets of $6.2 million  resulting from the original purchase of
Lehigh are  included on the  Company's  balance  sheet.  These  assets are fully
offset by the deferred tax asset valuation  allowance because under Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income Taxes," it is
currently  "more  likely  than not" that the value of these  assets  will not be
realized.  Management  reviews the  appropriateness  of the valuation  allowance
quarterly.

 Note 4. Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. Under
the terms of the contract which extends  through 2007, the Company is purchasing
71 percent of the output from a generating  plant which is capable of generating
up to 470 MW.  Reductions  to about 49 percent of the output are provided for in
the contract and, at the option of Square  Butte,  could begin after a five-year
advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power  and  energy is a  proportionate  share of Square  Butte's
fixed obligations and variable  operating costs,  based on the percentage of the
total  output  purchased by the Company.  The annual  fixed  obligations  of the
Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1996 through  2000.  The variable
operating costs are not incurred unless  production  takes place. The Company is
responsible  for paying all costs and  expenses  of Square  Butte if not paid by
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company are
absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered to the
Company.

Note 5.   Preferred Stock

On May 13, 1996 Minnesota Power redeemed all of the 170,000  outstanding  shares
of its Serial  Preferred Stock,  $7.36 Series.  The redemption price was $103.34
plus $.86 accrued  dividends.  Proceeds  from the QUIPS  financing in March 1996
were used to redeem the shares.

Note 6.   Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of MP&L Capital I

MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company  for the  purpose of  issuing  common and  preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  On March 20, 1996 the Trust  publicly  issued three  million 8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial  interests in the assets held by the Trust,  indirectly  resulting in
net proceeds to the Company of $72.6 million.  Holders of the QUIPS are entitled
to receive  quarterly  distributions  at an annual  rate of 8.05  percent of the
liquidation  preference  value of $25 per security.  The Company is the owner of
all the common trust securities, which constitute approximately 3 percent of the
aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust Securities.  The sole asset of the
Trust is $77.5 million of 8.05% Junior  Subordinated  Debentures,  Series A, Due
2015  (Subordinated  Debentures)  issued by the  Company,  interest  on which is
deductible by the Company for income tax  purposes.  The Trust will use interest
payments received on the Subordinated  Debentures it holds to make the quarterly
cash distributions on the QUIPS.

The QUIPS are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated
Debentures  at  maturity or upon  redemption.  The Company has the option at any
time on or after March 20, 2001, to redeem the Subordinated Debentures, in whole
or in part.  The Company  also has the option,  upon the  occurrence  of certain
events, (i) to redeem at any time the Subordinated Debentures,  in whole but not
in part,  which would result in the redemption of all the Trust  Securities,  or
(ii) to  terminate  the  Trust  and  cause  the  pro  rata  distribution  of the
Subordinated Debentures to the holders of the Trust Securities.

In addition to the Company's obligations under the Subordinated Debentures,  the
Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, payment of distributions on the
Trust  Securities,  to the  extent  the Trust has  funds  available  to pay such
distributions,  and has  agreed to pay all of the  expenses  of the Trust  (such
additional  obligations  collectively,  the  Back-up  Undertakings).  Considered
together, the Back-up Undertakings constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
by the Company of the Trust's obligations under the QUIPS.

Note 7.   Long-Term Debt

On May 30, 1996 ADESA  issued $90 million of 7.70% Senior  Notes,  Series A, Due
2006 in a  private  placement  offering.  Proceeds  were  used by ADESA to repay
existing indebtedness,  including borrowings under ADESA's revolving bank credit
agreement,  floating  rate option notes and certain  borrowings  from  Minnesota
Power. In June 1996 Lehigh obtained a $20 million adjustable rate revolving line
of  credit  due in  2003.  The  proceeds  were  used to  partially  finance  the
acquisition of real estate near Palm Coast, Florida.

Note 8.   Common Stock

Shareholder  Rights Plan. On July 24, 1996 the Board of Directors of the Company
adopted a rights  plan  (Rights  Plan)  pursuant to which it declared a dividend
distribution of one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each  outstanding
share of Common Stock of the Company (Common Stock) to shareholders of record at
the close of  business on July 24, 1996 (the  Record  Date) and  authorized  the
issuance of one Right with  respect to each share of Common  Stock that  becomes
outstanding  between the Record Date and July 23, 2006,  or such earlier time as
the Rights are redeemed.

Each Right will be  exercisable  to  purchase  one  one-hundredth  of a share of
Junior Serial Preferred Stock A, without par value, at an exercise price of $90,
subject to adjustment,  following a distribution date which shall be the earlier
to occur of (i) 10 days following a public  announcement  that a person or group
(Acquiring  Person) has acquired,  or obtained the right to acquire,  beneficial
ownership of 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (Stock
Acquisition  Date)  or (ii) 15  business  days  (or  such  later  date as may be
determined by the Board of Directors  prior to the time that any person  becomes
an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or a public  announcement of
an intention to make, a tender or exchange offer if, upon consummation  thereof,
such person would meet the 15 percent threshold.

Subject  to  certain  exempt  transactions,  in the  event  that the 15  percent
threshold is met, each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring  Person) will
thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise at the then current exercise
price of the Right, Common Stock (or, in certain  circumstances,  cash, property
or other  securities  of the  Company)  having a value  equal to two  times  the
exercise  price of the Right.  If, at any time  following the Stock  Acquisition
Date,  the  Company  is  acquired  in a  merger  or other  business  combination
transaction  or 50 percent or more of the Company's  assets or earning power are
sold,  each Right will entitle the holder (other than the  Acquiring  Person) to
receive,  upon exercise at the then current exercise price of the Right,  common
stock of the  acquiring or surviving  company  having a value equal to two times
the exercise price of the Right.  Certain stock acquisitions will also trigger a
provision permitting the Board of Directors to exchange each Right for one share
of Common Stock.

The Rights are  nonvoting  and expire on July 23, 2006,  unless  redeemed by the
Company  at a price  of $.01 per  Right  at any time  prior to the time a person
becomes  an  Acquiring  Person.  The  Board  of  Directors  has  authorized  the
reservation  of one  million  shares  of  Junior  Serial  Preferred  Stock A for
issuance under the Rights Plan in the event of excercise of the Rights.

Stock  Option and Award  Plans.  In May 1996  Company  shareholders  approved an
Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan (the  Executive  Plan) and a
Director  Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the Director Plan),  effective January
1, 1996.

The  Executive  Plan allows for the grant of up to 2.1 million  shares of Common
Stock to key  employees of the Company.  Such grants may be in the form of stock
options and other  awards,  including  stock  appreciation  rights,  restrictive
stock,  performance units and performance  shares. In January 1996 the Company
granted  non-qualified  stock options to purchase  132,542 shares of Common
Stock and granted 176,616 performance shares. Additionally, 24,000 restrictive
shares of Common Stock were granted, with the restriction expiring over a three-
year period. Pursuant to the Director Plan each nonemployee director receives an
annual grant of 725 stock options and a biennial grant of performance shares
equal to $10,000 in value of Common Stock on the date of grant.  The Director 
Plan provides for the grant of up to 150,000 shares of Common Stock.

The exercise price for stock options is equal to the market value of the Common
Stock on the date of a grant. Stock options may be excercised 50 percent on the
first anniversary date of the grant and the remaining 50 percent on the second
anniversary and expire on the tenth anniversary. Grants of performance shares
are earned over multi-year time periods upon the achievement of performance
objectives.

The Company  has  elected to  recognize  compensation  cost for its  stock-based
compensation  plans in accordance with Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No.
25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  Generally,  no  compensation
expense is recognized for stock options with exercise prices equal to the market
value of the underlying  shares of stock at the date of the grant.  Compensation
cost is recognized over the vesting  periods for performance  share awards based
on the market value of the underlying shares of stock.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
           Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota  Power  has  operations  in  four  business  segments:   (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
operations,   which  include  water  and  wastewater  services;  (3)  automobile
auctions,  which also include a finance  company and an auto transport  company;
and (4)  investments,  which  include real estate  operations  in Florida,  a 21
percent equity investment in a financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and a
securities portfolio.

Earnings per share of common  stock for the quarter  ended June 30, 1996 were 49
cents  compared  to 40 cents  for the  quarter  ended  June 30,  1995.  All four
business  segments were  profitable  for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996.
Although  earnings from electric  operations  decreased,  water  operations  and
investments significantly improved over second quarter results in 1995. The sale
of the  Company's  paper and pulp  business  was included in the results for the
quarter ended June 30, 1995 as discontinued operations.

Earnings  per share of common  stock for the six months ended June 30, 1996 were
$1.10  compared  to  $1.27  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  1995.  Factors
contributing to 1996 earnings include  increased  electric and water revenue,  a
gain  resulting  from the sale of certain  water  operations,  the  inclusion of
automobile  auctions and  improvement in real estate  operations  (excluding the
recognition of tax benefits in 1995).

Higher earnings in 1995 were attributed to the 52 cent per share  recognition of
tax  benefits  associated  with real  estate  operations.  Earnings in 1995 also
reflect an 18 cent per share provision associated with exiting the truck-mounted
lifting  equipment  business.  The sale of the Company's paper and pulp business
was included in 1995 as discontinued operations.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Quarter Ended June 30, 1996 and 1995.

Electric Operations.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations were
higher  in  1996  compared  to  1995  due  to a 30  percent  increase  in  total
kilowatthour  sales.  The  increase  in sales is  attributed  primarily  to the
Company's ability to market energy to other power suppliers.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 33 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1996  compared  to 36 percent in 1995.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 11 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1996 and 13 percent in 1995. Sales to other

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

power suppliers accounted for 15 percent of electric operating revenue in 1996
compared to 8 percent in 1995.

Although revenue from electric  operations was higher,  earnings for the quarter
ended June 30, 1996 were lower  reflecting  efforts in preparing for and meeting
the more  competitive  challenges of today's electric  industry.  New industrial
rates  were  lower on average  while  expenses  associated  with  marketing  new
products and improving  customer  service were higher.  Additionally,  the costs
associated with the early retirement plan offered in mid-1995 are being expensed
over  three  years and are  included  in 1996  expenses.  Scheduled  maintenance
expenses were also higher in 1996.

Water Operations. Operating revenue and income from water operations were higher
in 1996 due to the  addition of 17,000 new water and  wastewater  customers as a
result of the December 1995 purchase of the assets of Orange  Osceola  Utilities
(OOU) in  Florida,  and SSU's  implementation  of a $7.9  million  interim  rate
increase  effective  January 23, 1996.  Operating  costs also  increased in 1996
because of the purchase of OOU.

Automobile  Auctions.  ADESA sold 160,000 cars during the quarter ended June 30,
1996, the best quarterly  sales since  Minnesota Power purchased the business in
July 1995.  One  additional  auction  site was  purchased  during  the  quarter.
Operating expenses include significant start-up costs at two other new locations
added in 1996 and relocation costs for two existing auction operations.

Consolidated  operating  expenses in 1996 were  significantly  higher due to the
inclusion of ADESA's  operations  following  its purchase by the Company in July
1995.

Investments.
     - Securities Portfolio and Reinsurance. The Company's securities portfolio
       and reinsurance  performed well in 1996, however earnings were less 
       because the portfolio  balance was smaller.  A portion of the portfolio
       was sold in 1995 to fund the purchase of ADESA.

     - Real Estate  Operations.   Increased  land  sales,   combined  with  the
       recognition  of $2 million of tax  benefits at Lehigh, resulted in a more
       profitable quarter for the Company's real estate business in 1996.

Discontinued  Operations.  Income from discontinued  operations in 1995 reflects
the sale and operating  results of the paper and pulp business which was sold in
June 1995.


Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 1996 and 1995.

Electric Operations.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations were
higher  in  1996  compared  to  1995  due  to a 22  percent  increase  in  total
kilowatthour  sales.  The  increase  in sales is  attributed  primarily  to the
Company's  ability to market energy to other power  suppliers as well as extreme
winter weather in 1996 compared to the milder winter in 1995.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 32 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1996  compared  to 36 percent in 1995.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 11 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1996 and 13 percent in 1995. Sales to other power
suppliers  accounted  for 12  percent  of  electric  operating  revenue  in 1996
compared to 6 percent in 1995.

Purchased  power and other expenses for electric  operations  were  considerably
higher in 1996 than in 1995.  Increased  purchased  power costs were incurred in
1996 to meet higher demand. However, the average cost per kilowatthour was lower
than in 1995.  Square  Butte,  one of  Minnesota  Power's low priced  sources of
energy,  produced 64 percent more energy in 1996,  while in 1995 it was down for
scheduled  maintenance.  Costs associated with the early retirement  offering in
mid-1995 are being expensed over three years and are reflected in 1996 expenses.
Scheduled maintenance expenses were higher in 1996.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

Water Operations. Operating revenue and income from water operations were higher
in 1996 due to the $1.1 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Seabrook's  assets
in South Carolina,  the addition of 17,000 new water and wastewater customers as
a result of the  December  1995  purchase of the assets of OOU in  Florida,  and
SSU's  implementation of a $7.9 million interim rate increase  effective January
23, 1996. Operating costs also increased in 1996 because of the purchase of OOU.

Automobile  Auctions.  Automobile  auction  operations were  profitable  despite
severe winter  weather on the east coast which limited  auction sales in January
1996. New auctions began  operations at  Jacksonville,  Florida and Newark,  New
Jersey during the first half of 1996.  Start-up costs  associated with these new
sites have had a negative impact on profitability of this segment and are 
expected to continue  having such an impact on results  through  1997.  All
other auction sites  including,  ADESA's  acquisition of an auto auction 
facility in Portage, Wisconsin, have performed well in 1996.

Consolidated  operating  expenses  in 1996 are  significantly  higher due to the
inclusion of ADESA's  operations  following  its purchase by the Company in July
1995.

Investments.
     - Securities Portfolio and Reinsurance. The Company's securities portfolio
       and  reinsurance  performed  well in  1996.  The  portfolio produced less
       earnings in 1996 because its balance was smaller as a result of the sale 
       of a portion of the portfolio to fund the purchase of ADESA.
     
     - Real Estate Operations.  Revenue in 1996 includes  $3.7 million from the
       sale of Lehigh's joint venture in a resort and golf course. In 1995 $18.4
       million of tax benefits were recognized by Lehigh. The Company's portion 
       of the tax benefits reflected as net income was $14.7 million, or 52 
       cents per share. In 1996 an additional $2 million of tax benefits were 
       recognized.

Corporate  Charges and Other.  In March 1995 the  Company  recorded a $5 million
provision,  lowering  earnings per share by 18 cents, in anticipation of exiting
the truck-mounted lifting equipment business.

Discontinued  Operations.  Income from discontinued  operations in 1995 reflects
the  operating  results  of the paper and pulp  business  which was sold in June
1995.


Liquidity and Financial Position

Reference is made to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months
ended  June  30,  1996 and  1995,  for  purposes  of the  following  discussion.
Automobile auction operations, which were acquired July 1, 1995, are included in
the six months ended June 30, 1996.

Cash Flow Activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and approximately  5,268,000  original issue shares of common stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company for the purpose of issuing common and preferred securities. On March 20,
1996 the Trust publicly issued three million 8.05%  Cumulative  Quarterly Income
Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred beneficial interests in the
assets held by the Trust, indirectly resulting in net proceeds to the Company of
$72.6 million. The net proceeds to the Company were used to retire approximately
$56 million of  commercial  paper and  approximately  $17  million  were used to
redeem all of the outstanding  shares of the Company's  Serial  Preferred Stock,
$7.36 Series, on May 13, 1996.

On May 30, 1996 ADESA  issued $90 million of 7.70% Senior  Notes,  Series A, Due
2006 in a  private  placement  offering.  Proceeds  were  used by ADESA to repay
existing indebtedness,  including borrowings

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

under ADESA's  revolving bank credit  agreement,  floating rate option notes and
certain  borrowings  from Minnesota  Power.  In June 1996 Lehigh  obtained a $20
million  adjustable rate revolving line of credit due in 2003. The proceeds were
used to  partially  finance  the  acquisition  of real  estate  near Palm Coast,
Florida.

On June 24, 1996 the Company's  registration  with the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission  became  effective  with  respect to 5 million  additional  shares of
common stock for offer and sale  pursuant to the DRIP.  Previously  available to
registered  holders and electric utility  customers,  the DRIP has been amended,
effective July 2, 1996, to, among other things,  expand the customer feature and
allow any interested  investor to enroll in the plan with an initial  investment
of $250.  Capital  raised through the sale of new issue shares under the DRIP is
expected to be used for general corporate purposes.

Capital Requirements. Consolidated capital expenditures for the six months ended
June 30, 1996 totaled $53 million.  These  expenditures  include $19 million for
electric  operations,  $8  million  for water  operations  and $26  million  for
automobile  auction  operations.  Internally  generated  funds were the  primary
source for funding  electric  and water  operation  expenditures.  ADESA  issued
long-term debt to finance its construction expenditures.

On June 27, 1996 the Company filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of  Columbia  Circuit a  petition  for review of the order issued by the FERC
granting a new license for the  Company's  St. Louis River  Project. On June 28,
1996  separate  petitions  for  review  were filed in the same court by the U.S.
Department of the Interior and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa,  
two intervenors  in the  licensing  proceedings.  The issues to be resolved

The wholesale transmission tariff filed on April 16, 1996, in anticipation of
new rules governing open access transmission for wholesale service became
effective on June 16, 1996 subject to refund pending a hearing before an 
Administrative Law Judge and final FERC approval. The hearing is scheduled to 
begin on January 14, 1997. As required by Order No. 888, the Company filed with
the FERC on July 9, 1996, a tariff for open access transmission service 
incorporating the terms and conditions of the FERC's pro forma tariff with
appropriate modifications. A decision on the filing is pending.

In order to comply with the FERC's regulations and policies governing open 
access to electric transmission systems, the Company has initiated procedures
which will result in the functional separation of the Company's operation of its
transmission system from other aspects of its business as required by the FERC's
Standards of Conduct implemented by Order No. 889. Compliance with Order No. 889
is required by November 1, 1996.

On July 15, 1996, the FERC accepted for filing and made effective a tariff 
allowing the Comapny to sell power at market-based rates. The tariff will permit
the Company to respond more quickly and in a more competitive manner to requests
for power from wholesale customers.

pursuant  to Article 15 herein,  until all Shares  subject to it shall have been
purchased or acquired according to the Plan's provisions.  However,  in no event

Effective Date.

size and types of Grants;  to determine the terms and  conditions of such Grants
in a manner consistent with the Plan; to construe and interpret the Plan and any
agreement or  instrument  entered into under the Plan;  to  establish,  amend or
waive rules and regulations for the Plan's  administration;  and (subject to the
provisions  of  Article  15  herein)  to amend the terms and  conditions  of any
outstanding Grant.  Further,  the Committee shall make all other  determinations
which may be necessary  or  advisable  for the  administration  of the Plan.  As
permitted by law, the  Committee  may delegate  its  authorities  as  identified
hereunder.

        3     Decisions Binding.  All determinations  and  decisions made by the
Committee  pursuant  to the  provisions  of the Plan and all  related  orders or
resolutions of the Board shall be final,  conclusive and binding on all persons,

number  of  Shares  available  for grant  under  the Plan  shall be two  million
one hundred thousand (2,100,000).  Shares  underlying  lapsed or forfeited
Grants, or Grants that are not paid in stock, may be reused for other Grants. 
Shares may be (i) authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or (ii) shares
purchased on the open market.

        2     Adjustments in Authorized Shares.  In the  event of  any  merger,

dividend, split-up, share combination or other change in the corporate structure
of the Company affecting the Shares, such adjustment shall be made in the number
and class of Shares which may be delivered under the Plan, and in the number and
class of and/or  price of Shares  subject to  outstanding  Grants made under the
Plan, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee,  in
its sole  discretion,  to prevent  dilution or enlargement of rights;  provided,
however,  that the number of Shares subject to any Grant shall always be a whole
number.

5.      Eligibility and Participation

        1     Eligibility.  Persons eligible to participate in the Plan include
all  officers  and  key  employees  of the  Company  and  its  Subsidiaries,  as
determined by the Committee,  including  Employees who are members of the Board,
but excluding Directors who are not Employees.

        2     Actual Participation. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the
Committee may, from time to time,  select from all eligible  Employees  those to
whom  Grants  shall be made and shall  determine  the  nature and amount of each
Grant.


6.      Stock Options

        1     Grant of Options. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
Options  may be granted  to an  Eligible  Employee  at any time and from time to
time, as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have complete
discretion in  determining  the number of Shares  subject to Options  granted to
each  Participant  (subject  to  Article  4  herein)  and  consistent  with  the
provisions of the Plan, in determining  the terms and  conditions  pertaining to
such Options; provided, however, the maximum number of shares subject to Options
which may be granted to any single  Participant  during any one calendar year is
twenty thousand  (20,000).  The Committee may grant ISOs, NQSOs or a combination
thereof.

        2     Option Grant Agreement. Each Option grant shall be evidenced by
an Option Grant  Agreement that shall specify the Option Price,  the duration of
the  Option,  the number of Shares to which the Option  pertains,  the  Exercise
Period and such other  provisions as the Committee shall  determine.  The Option
Grant  Agreement also shall specify  whether the Option is intended to be an ISO
or a NQSO.

        3     Option Price. The Option Price for each Option granted under the
Plan shall be the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.

        4     Duration of Options. Each  Option shall expire at such time as the
Committee  shall  determine  at the time of grant;  provided,  however,  that no
Option shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th)  anniversary of its date
of grant.

        5     Dividend Equivalents. Simultaneously with the grant of an Option,
the Participant  receiving the Option may be granted  Dividend  Equivalents with
respect  to the  Shares  subject  to such  Option.  Dividend  Equivalents  shall
constitute rights to amounts equal to the dividends  declared on an equal number
of outstanding  Shares on all payment dates occurring  during the period between
the grant date of an Option and the date the Option is exercised.  The Committee
shall determine at the time Dividend Equivalents are granted the conditions,  if
any, to which the payment of such Dividend Equivalents is subject.

        6     Exercise of and Payment for Options. Options granted under the
Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such  restrictions and
conditions as the Committee  shall in each instance  approve,  which need not be
the same for each  Grant or for each  Participant.  However,  in no event may an
Option  granted  under  the Plan  become  exercisable  prior  to six (6)  months
following the date of its grant.

                                   6
<PAGE>

         A  Participant  may  exercise an Option at any time during the Exercise
Period.  Options  shall be  exercised  by the  delivery  of a written  notice of
exercise to the  Company,  setting  forth the number of Shares  with  respect to
which the Option is to be exercised,  accompanied by provisions for full payment
for the Shares.

         The Option  Price upon  exercise of any Option  shall be payable to the
Company  in  full  either  (a) in  cash  or  its  equivalent,  (b) by  tendering
previously  acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of
exercise  equal to the total  Option Price  (provided  that the Shares which are
tendered  must  have been held by the  Participant  for at least six (6)  months
prior to their tender to satisfy the Option Price),  (c) by share withholding or
(d) by a combination of (a), (b) and/or (c).

         The  Committee  also may allow  cashless  exercise as  permitted  under
Federal  Reserve  Board's  Regulation  T, subject to applicable  securities  law
restrictions,  or by any  other  means  which  the  Committee  determines  to be
consistent with the Plan's purpose and applicable law.

         As soon as  practicable  after  receipt  of a written  notification  of
exercise of an Option and  provisions  for full  payment  therefor,  the Company
shall deliver to the Participant,  in the Participant's name, Share certificates
in an  appropriate  amount based upon the number of Shares  purchased  under the
Option(s).

        7     Restrictions on Share Transferability.  The Committee may impose
such  restrictions on any Shares acquired  pursuant to the exercise of an Option
under  the  Plan  as it  may  deem  advisable,  including,  without  limitation,
restrictions  to  comply  with  applicable  Federal  securities  laws,  with the
requirements  of any stock  exchange  or market  upon which such Shares are then
listed and/or traded and with any blue sky or state  securities  laws applicable
to such Shares.

        8     Termination of Employment. Each Option Grant Agreement shall set
forth the extent to which the  Participant  shall have the right to exercise the
Option following  termination of the  Participant's  employment with the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion
of the Committee,  shall be included in the Option Grant Agreement  entered into
with Participants, need not be uniform among all Options granted pursuant to the
Plan or among Participants and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for
termination of employment.

        9     Nontransferability of Options. No Option granted under the Plan
may  be  sold,  transferred,   pledged,  assigned,  or  otherwise  alienated  or
hypothecated,  other  than by will or by the laws of descent  and  distribution.
Further,  all  Options  granted  to  a  Participant  under  the  Plan  shall  be
exercisable  during his or her lifetime only by such  Participant  or his or her
legal representative.


7.      Stock Appreciation Rights

        1     Grant of SARs. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
an SAR may be granted to an Eligible Employee at any time and from time to time,
as shall be determined by the  Committee.  The Committee may grant  Freestanding
SARs, Tandem SARs or any combination of these forms of SAR.

                                   7
<PAGE>

        The Committee  shall have complete  discretion in determining the number
of SARs  granted  to  each  Participant  (subject  to  Article  4  herein)  and,
consistent  with the  provisions  of the  Plan,  in  determining  the  terms and
conditions  pertaining to such SARs;  provided,  however,  the maximum number of
SARs which may be granted to any single Participant during any one calendar year
is twenty thousand (20,000).

         The Base Value of a Freestanding  SAR shall equal the Fair Market Value
of a Share on the date of grant of the SAR.  The Base Value of Tandem SARs shall
equal the Option Price of the related Option.  In no event shall any SAR granted
hereunder become exercisable within the first six (6) months of its grant.

        2     SAR Grant Agreement. Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an SAR
Grant Agreement  that shall specify the number of SARs  granted, the Base Value,
the term of the SAR (not to exceed ten (10) years), the Exercise Period and such
other provisions as the Committee shall determine.

        3     Exercise of Tandem SARs.  Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or
part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right
to exercise the equivalent  portion of the related  Option.  A Tandem SAR may be
exercised  only with respect to the Shares for which its related  Option is then
exercisable.

        Notwithstanding  any other  provision of the Plan to the contrary,  with
respect to a Tandem SAR granted in  connection  with an ISO:  (i) the Tandem SAR
will expire no later than the expiration of the  underlying  ISO; (ii) the value
of the payout with respect to the Tandem SAR may be for no more than one hundred
percent (100%) of the difference  between the Option Price of the underlying ISO
and the Fair Market  Value of the Shares  subject to the  underlying  ISO at the
time the Tandem SAR is exercised; and (iii) the Tandem SAR may be exercised only
when the Fair Market  Value of the Shares  subject to the ISO exceeds the Option
Price of the ISO.

        4     Exercise of Freestanding SARs. Freestanding SARs may be exercised
upon  whatever  terms and  conditions  the  Committee,  in its sole  discretion,
imposes upon them.

        5     Exercise and Payment of SARs. A Participant may exercise an SAR
at anytime during the Exercise  Period.  SARs shall be exercised by the delivery
of a written notice of exercise to the Company, setting forth the number of SARs
being  exercised.  Upon exercise of an SAR, a  Participant  shall be entitled to
receive payment from the Company in an amount equal to the product of:

        (a)    the  excess of (i) the Fair Market  Value of a Share on the date
of exercise over (ii) the Base Value of the SAR, multiplied by

        (b)    the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

        At the sole  discretion of the Committee,  the payment upon SAR exercise
may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.

                                  8
<PAGE>

        6     Termination of Employment.  Each SAR Grant Agreement shall set
forth the extent to which the  Participant  shall have the right to exercise the
SAR following  termination of the Participant's  employment with the Company and
its Subsidiaries.  Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of
the Committee,  shall be included in the SAR Grant  Agreement  entered into with
Participants, need not be uniform among all SARs granted pursuant to the Plan or
among  Participants  and may  reflect  distinctions  based  on the  reasons  for
termination of employment.

        7     Nontransferability of SARs. No SAR granted under the Plan may be
sold, transferred,  pledged,  assigned, or otherwise  alienated or hypothecated,
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, all SARs
granted to a Participant  under the Plan shall be exercisable  during his or her
lifetime only by such Participant or his or her legal representative.


8.      Restricted Stock

        1     Grant of Restricted Stock.  Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Plan,  Restricted Stock may be granted to Eligible  Employees at any time
and from time to time, as shall be determined  by the  Committee.  The Committee
shall have complete discretion in determining the number of shares of Restricted
Stock granted to each Participant  (subject to Article 4 herein) and, consistent
with the  provisions  of the Plan,  in  determining  the  terms  and  conditions
pertaining to such Restricted Stock.

        2     Restricted Stock Grant Agreement. Each Restricted Stock grant
shall  be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Grant Agreement that shall specify the
Period or Periods of Restriction,  the number of Restricted Stock Shares granted
and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine.

        3     Transferability.  Except as provided in this Article 8, Restricted
Stock  granted  herein  may not be  sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned,  or
otherwise  alienated or hypothecated  until the end of the applicable  Period of
Restriction  established by the Committee and specified in the Restricted  Stock
Grant Agreement. However, in no event may any Restricted Stock granted under the
Plan become vested in a Participant  prior to six (6) months  following the date
of its grant.  All rights  with  respect to the  Restricted  Stock  granted to a
Participant under the Plan shall be available during his or her lifetime only to
such Participant.
 
        4     Certificate  Legend.  Each certificate  representing  Restricted
Stock granted pursuant to the Plan may bear a legend substantially as follows:

        "The sale or other  transfer of the shares of stock  represented by
        this certificate, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of
        law, is subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in
        the Minnesota  Power  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation
        Plan,  and in a Restricted  Stock Grant  Agreement.  A copy of such
        Plan and such  Agreement  may be obtained  from  Minnesota  Power &
        Light Company."

     The Company  shall have the right to retain the  certificates  representing
Restricted Stock in the Company's possession until such time as all restrictions
applicable to such Shares have been satisfied.

        5     Removal of Restrictions.  Except as otherwise provided in this
Article 8, Restricted  Stock shall become freely  transferable by the
Participant  after the last day of the Period of Restriction applicable thereto.
Once Restricted  Stock is released from the restrictions,  the  Participant
shall be entitled to have the legend  referred to in Section 8.4 removed  from
his or her stock certificate.

                                   9
<PAGE>

        6     Voting Rights. During the Period of Restriction,  Participants
holding  Restricted  Stock may exercise  full voting  rights with respect to
those Shares.

        7     Dividends and Other Distributions.  During the Period of
Restriction,  Participants  holding  Restricted Stock shall be credited with all
regular cash  dividends  paid with respect to all Shares while they are so held.
All cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to Restricted Stock
shall  be  credited  to  Participants   subject  to  the  same  restrictions  on
transferability and forfeitability as the Restricted Stock with respect to which
they were paid. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares,  such
Shares  shall  be  subject  to the  same  restrictions  on  transferability  and
forfeitability  as the  Restricted  Stock with  respect to which they were paid.
Subject  to the  restrictions  on vesting  and the  forfeiture  provisions,  all
dividends  credited to a Participant  shall be paid to the Participant  promptly
following  the full vesting of the  Restricted  Stock with respect to which such
dividends were paid. The provisions of this Section 8.7 are subject to the right
of the Committee to determine otherwise at the time of grant.

        8     Termination  of  Employment.  Each  Restricted  Stock Grant
Agreement  shall set forth the  extent to which the  Participant  shall have the
right  to  receive  unvested  Restricted  Shares  following  termination  of the
Participant's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.  Such provisions
shall be determined in the sole  discretion of the Committee,  shall be included
in the Restricted Stock Grant Agreement entered into with Participants, need not
be uniform among all grants of Restricted  Stock or among  Participants  and may
reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment.
 
9.      Performance Units and Performance Shares

        1     Grant of  Performance  Units and Performance  Shares.  Subject to
the  terms of the Plan,  Performance  Units  and/or  Performance  Shares  may be
granted to an Eligible  Employee at any time and from time to time,  as shall be
determined by the  Committee.  The Committee  shall have complete  discretion in
determining the number of Performance Units and/or Performance Shares granted to
each  Participant  (subject  to  Article  4  herein)  and,  consistent  with the
provisions of the Plan, in determining  the terms and  conditions  pertaining to
such Grants;  provided,  however,  the maximum payout to any single  Participant
with respect to Performance Units granted in any one calendar year shall be 200%
of base salary  determined  at the earlier of the  beginning of the  Performance
Period  and the time the  performance  goals are set by the  Committee  and with
respect to Performance Shares shall be twenty thousand (20,000) shares.

        2     Performance  Unit/Performance  Share Grant  Agreement.  Each grant
of  Performance  Units  and/or  Performance  Shares  shall  be  evidenced  by  a
Performance Unit and/or Performance Share Grant Agreement that shall specify the
number of Performance Units and/or Performance Shares granted, the initial value
(if applicable),  the Performance  Period,  the performance goals and such other
provisions as the Committee shall determine,  including, but not limited to, any
right to Dividend Equivalents during or after the Performance Period.

                                   10
<PAGE>

        3     Value of Performance  Units/Shares.  Each  Performance  Unit shall
have an initial value that is established by the Committee at the time of grant.
The  value of a  Performance  Share  shall  equal the  value of one  Share.  The
Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which,  depending on the
extent  to  which  they are met,  will  determine  the  number  and/or  value of
Performance  Units/Shares  that will be paid out to the  Participants.  The time
period  during  which  the  performance  goals  must be met  shall  be  called a
"Performance  Period."  Performance Periods shall, in all cases, be at least six
(6) months in length.

        Unless and until the Committee  proposes for shareholder  vote a change
in the general  performance goals set forth below, the attainment of which shall
serve as a basis for the determination of the number and/or value of Performance
Units and/or Performance Shares granted under the Plan, the performance goals to
be used for purposes of grants to Named  Executive  Officers shall be based upon
any one or more of the following:

        (a)      Total  shareholder return (measured as the sum of Share
             appreciation  and  dividends declared).

        (b)      Return on invested capital, assets or net assets.

        (c)      Share earnings/earnings growth.

        (d)      Cash flow/cash flow growth.

        (e)      Cost of services to consumers.

        (f)      Growth in revenues, sales, operating income, net income, stock
             price and/or earnings per share.

        (h)      Economic value created.

        (i)      Customer satisfaction and/or customer service quality.

        (j)      Operating effectiveness.

      In the event that applicable tax and/or securities laws change to permit
Committee discretion to alter the governing  performance goals without obtaining
shareholder  approval of such changes and without losing any income tax benefits
to the Company,  the Committee  shall have sole  discretion to make such changes
without obtaining shareholder approval.

        4     Earning of Performance Units/Shares. After the applicable
Performance  Period has ended, the holder of Performance  Units/Shares  shall be
entitled to receive payout with respect to the Performance  Units/Shares  earned
by the Participant over the Performance  Period,  to be determined as a function
of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

                                   11
<PAGE>

        5     Form and  Timing of  Payment  of  Performance  Units/Shares.
Payment of earned Performance  Units/Shares shall be made following the close of
the applicable Performance Period or at such later time as the Committee, in its
sole discretion,  may determine. The Committee, in its sole discretion,  may pay
earned  Performance  Units/Shares  in cash  or in  Shares  (or in a  combination
thereof),  which have an  aggregate  Fair Market Value equal to the value of the
earned  Performance Units/Shares  at the  close of the  applicable  Performance
Period.  Such Shares may  be  granted  subject  to  any  restrictions  deemed
appropriate by the Committee.

        6     Dividend Equivalents. Simultaneously with the grant of Performance
Shares, the Participant may be granted Dividend Equivalents with respect to such
Performance  Shares.  Dividend  Equivalents  shall constitute  rights to amounts
equal to the dividends  declared on an equal number of outstanding Shares on all
payment dates  occurring  during the period  between the grant date and the date
the Performance  Shares are earned or paid out. The Committee shall determine at
the time Dividend  Equivalents are granted the conditions,  if any, to which the
payment of such Dividend Equivalents is subject.

        7     Termination of Employment.  Each Grant  Agreement  shall set forth
the  extent  to which  the  Participant  shall  have  the  right  to  receive  a
Performance   Unit/Share  payout  following  termination  of  the  Participant's
employment  with the  Company and its  Subsidiaries.  Such  provisions  shall be
determined  in the sole  discretion of the  Committee,  shall be included in the
Grant Agreement  entered into with the  Participants,  need not be uniform among
all grants of Performance  Units/Shares  or among  Participants  and may reflect
distinctions based upon reasons for termination of employment.

        8     Nontransferability.  Performance  Units/Shares  may  not be sold,
transferred,  pledged,  assigned or otherwise  alienated or hypothecated,  other
than  by  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution.   Further,  a
Participant's   rights   under  the  Plan  shall  be   exercisable   during  the
Participant's  lifetime  only  by the  Participant  or the  Participant's  legal
representative.

10.     Other Grants

       The  Committee  shall  have the  right to make  other  Grants  which may
include,  without  limitation,  the grant of Shares based on certain conditions,
the payment of cash based on performance  criteria established by the Committee,
and the payment of Shares in lieu of cash under other Company incentive or bonus
programs.  Payment  under or settlement of any such Grants shall be made in such
manner and at such times as the Committee may determine.


11.     Beneficiary Designation

       Each  Participant  under  the Plan  may,  from  time to  time,  name any
beneficiary or beneficiaries  (who may be named contingently or successively) to
whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before
he or she  receives  any or all of such  benefit.  Each such  designation  shall
revoke  all  prior  designations  by the  same  Participant,  shall be in a form
prescribed  by the  Committee,  and will be  effective  only  when  filed by the
Participant in writing with the Committee during the Participant's  lifetime. In
the  absence  of  any  such  designation,   benefits  remaining  unpaid  at  the
Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

        The spouse of a married  Participant  domiciled in a community  property
jurisdiction shall join in any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries other
than the spouse.

                                   12
<PAGE>
12. Deferrals

        The  Committee  may permit a  Participant  to defer  such  Participant's
receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be
due to such  Participant  by  virtue  of (1) the  exercise  of an SAR or (2) the
satisfaction  of any  requirements  or goals with respect to any Grants.  If any
such  deferral  election  is  permitted,   the  Committee  shall,  in  its  sole
discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals.


13. Rights of Employees

        1     Employment.  Nothing in the Plan shall  interfere with or limit in
any way the right of the Company to terminate  any  Participant's  employment at
any time,  for any reason or no reason in the  Company's  sole  discretion,  nor
confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company.

        2     Participation. No  Employee shall have the right to be selected to
receive a Grant under the Plan,  or, having been so selected,  to be selected to
receive a future Grant.


14.     Change in Control

        Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,  as defined  herein,  unless
otherwise  specifically  prohibited  by the terms of Article 18 herein or unless
the Committee provides otherwise prior to the Change in Control:

        (a)      Any  and  all Options and SARs granted hereunder shall  become
             immediately exercisable;

        (b)      Any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted
             Stock shall be deemed to have expired;

        (c)      With  respect  to all outstanding Grants of Performance Units,
             Performance   Shares  and other performance-based   Grants,  there
             shall be paid out immediately to Participants the superior number
             of Performance Units or Shares granted for the entire Performance
             Period as increased by Dividend Equivalents for the entire
             Performance Period. Payment shall be made in cash or in stock, as
             determined by the Committee. However, there shall not be an
             accelerated payout under this Section 14(c) with respect to Grants
             of Performance Units, Performance Shares or other performance-based
             Grants which were made less than six (6) months prior to the
             effective date of the Change in Control; and

                                   13
<PAGE>
 
        (d)      All  earned  Performance  Units, Performance Shares  and  other
             performance-based  Grants (as increased by any Dividend Equivalents
             to the  date of  payment)  not  yet  paid  out  shall  be paid  out
             immediately, in cash or in stock, as determined by the Committee.

time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole
or in part;  provided,  however,  that no amendment  which requires  shareholder
approval  in order for the Plan to  continue to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act,  including any successor to such Rule,  shall be effective  unless
such amendment  shall be approved by the requisite vote of the  shareholders  of
the Company entitled to vote thereon.

        2     Grants  Previously Made. No termination, amendment or modification
of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Grant previously made
under the Plan,  without the written  consent of the  Participant  holding  such
Grant  unless  such  termination,  modification  or  amendment  is  required  by
applicable law.

16.     Withholding

        1     Tax  Withholding.  The Company shall have the power and the right
to deduct or withhold,  or require a  Participant  to remit to the  Company,  an
amount  sufficient  to satisfy  Federal,  state and local taxes  (including  the
Participant's FICA obligation)  required by law to be withheld with respect to a
Grant made under the Plan.

        2     Share  Withholding.  With  respect to  withholding  required  upon
the exercise of Options or SARs,  upon the lapse of  restrictions  on Restricted
Stock,  or upon any other  taxable event arising out of or as a result of Grants
made  hereunder,  Participants  may  elect,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
Committee,  to satisfy  the  withholding  requirement,  in whole or in part,  by
having the Company  withhold  Shares  having a Fair Market Value on the date the
tax is to be determined equal to the minimum  statutory total tax which could be
imposed on the transaction. All elections shall be irrevocable,  made in writing
and signed by the Participant.

17.     Successors

        All  obligations  of the Company under the Plan,  with respect to Grants
made  hereunder,  shall be binding on any successor to the Company,  whether the

merger,  consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company.

context,  any masculine  term used herein also shall  include the feminine,  the
plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.

        2     Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect
the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as
if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

        3     Requirements of Law. The making of Grants and the issuance of
Shares  under  the Plan  shall be  subject  to all  applicable  laws,  rules and
regulations,  and to such  approvals  by any  governmental  agencies or national
securities exchanges as may be required.

        Notwithstanding  any other  provision set forth in the Plan, if required
by the then-current Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any "derivative security" or
"equity security" offered pursuant to the Plan to any Insider may not be sold or
transferred  within the minimum time limits  specified or required in such rule.
The terms "equity  security" and  "derivative  security" shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the then-current Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act.

        4     Securities Law Compliance.  With respect to Insiders, transactions
under the Plan are  intended to comply  with all  applicable  conditions  of the

the  Committee  fails to so  comply,  it shall be deemed  null and void,  to the
extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee.

        5     Governing  Law. To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the
Plan, and all agreements  hereunder,  shall be construed in accordance with, and

1.      Establishment, Purpose and Duration
 
        1     Establishment of the Plan.  Minnesota Power & Light Company,
a  Minnesota  corporation  (hereinafter  referred to as the  "Company"),  hereby
establishes  an  outside  director  plan to be  known  as the  "Minnesota  Power
Director  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive  Plan"  (hereinafter  referred  to as  the
"Plan"),  as set forth in this  document.  The Plan  provides for the  automatic
grant of Stock Options and Performance Shares to non-employee directors.

        The Plan shall become  effective as of January 1, 1996 (the  "Effective
Date"),  subject to shareholder approval, and shall remain in effect as provided
in Section 1.3 herein.
 
        2     Purpose of the Plan.  The  purpose of the Plan is to promote
the  success  and  enhance  the value of the  Company  by linking  the  personal
interests  of directors  to those of Company  shareholders.  The Plan is further
intended to assist the Company in its  ability to  motivate,  attract and retain
highly qualified individuals to serve as directors of the Company.
 
        3     Duration  of the  Plan.  The  Plan  shall  commence  on the
Effective Date, as described in Section 1.1 herein,  and shall remain in effect,
subject to the right of the Board of Directors to terminate the Plan at any time
pursuant  to Article 12 herein,  until all Shares  subject to it shall have been
purchased or acquired according to the Plan's provisions.  However,  in no event
may a Grant be made  under  the Plan on or after the  tenth  anniversary  of the
Effective Date.
 
        4     Long-Term  Incentive  Plan. The Company has  previously  made
grants to outside directors under the Directors' Long-Term Incentive Plan, which
provides for maximum award  opportunities  of 600 shares of Company common stock
every  other year.  The terms of this plan are set forth in Annex A hereto.  One
performance period (1994-1997) is still running under this plan, although no new
performance  period will commence in 1996. On and after the Effective  Date, the
shares relating to the existing performance period shall be deemed to be covered
by this Plan and shall be counted  against the number of shares  available under
this Plan,  and their  grant and the  performance  goals shall be deemed to have
been approved by Company shareholders by their approval of this Plan.

Shares (as  increased  by the  Dividend  Equivalents)  shall  continue to accrue
Dividend  Equivalents,  as set forth in Section 7.2 above, until paid out as set
forth in the next sentence.  One-half of the remaining earned Performance Shares
(as  increased  by the  Dividend  Equivalents)  shall be paid  out on the  first

              earned  Performance Shares have been paid out, the Participant (or
              his  beneficiary  or estate) shall be entitled to a full payout of
              all  earned  Performance  Shares  (as  increased  by the  Dividend
              Equivalents), which shall be paid promptly after such occurrence.
 
        2     Other.  Except as set forth in Article 11 herein, in the event a
participant ceases to be a director of the Company for any other reason

              (i) all Stock Options not yet exercisable or exercised shall be
              forfeited;

              (ii) all Performance Shares and related Dividend Equivalents
              not yet earned shall be forfeited; and
 
              (iii) all earned Performance Shares (as increased by Dividend
              Equivalents) shall continue to accrue Dividend Equivalents and
              shall be paid out as and when provided in Section 7.6 above.

9.      Beneficiary Designation
 
        Each  Participant  under  the Plan  may,  from  time to  time,  name any
beneficiary or beneficiaries  (who may be named contingently or successively) to
whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before
he or she  receives  any or all of such  benefit.  Each such  designation  shall
revoke  all  prior  designations  by the  same  Participant,  shall be in a form
prescribed  by the  Committee  and  will be  effective  only  when  filed by the
Participant in writing with the Committee during the Participant's  lifetime. In
the  absence  of  any  such  designation,   benefits   remaining  unpaid  at the
Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

        The spouse of a married  Participant  domiciled in a community  property
jurisdiction shall join in any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries other
than the spouse.
 
10. Continuation of Directors in Same Status
 
        Nothing in the Plan or any action taken pursuant to the Plan
shall be  construed  as creating or  constituting  evidence of any  agreement or
understanding,  express or implied, that the Company will retain a Director as a
director  or in any other  capacity  for any  period of time or at a  particular
retainer or other rate of  compensation,  as conferring upon any Participant any
legal or other right to continue as a director or in any other  capacity,  or as
limiting,  interfering  with or otherwise  affecting the right of the Company to
terminate a  Participant  in his capacity as a director or otherwise at any time
for any reason,  with or without  cause,  and without  regard to the effect that
such termination might have upon him as a Participant under the Plan.
 
11.     Change in Control

        Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,  as defined herein,  unless
otherwise specifically prohibited by the terms of Article 16 herein:
 
        (a)     Any and all Options granted hereunder shall become immediately
                exercisable;
 
        (b)     With  respect  to all  outstanding  Grants of  Performance
                Shares, the Committee (i) shall determine the greater of (x) the
                payout at 100% of the number of  Performance  Shares granted for
                the entire  Performance  Period  and (y) the  payout  based upon
                actual  performance for the Performance  Period ending as of the
                effective  date of the Change in  Control,  in either case after
                giving effect to accumulation  of Dividend  Equivalents and (ii)
                shall pay to the  Participants  immediately  the greater of such
                amounts,  in Shares,  prorated based upon the number of complete
                and partial calendar months within the Performance  Period which
                have elapsed as of the  effective  date of the Change in Control
                in  relation  to the  number  of  calendar  months  in the  full
                Performance Period.  However,  there shall not be an accelerated
                payout  under  this  Section  11(b)  with  respect  to Grants of
                Performance  Shares  which  were made  less than six (6)  months
                prior to the effective date of the Change in Control; and
 
                                       9
<PAGE>


 
        (c)    All earned Performance  Shares (as increased by Dividend
               Equivalents) not yet paid out shall be paid out immediately.

 
12.     Amendment, Modification  and Termination
 
        1     Amendment,  Modification and Termination.  The Board may, at
any time and from time to time, alter,  amend,  suspend or terminate the Plan in
whole  or  in  part;  provided,   however,  that  no  amendment  which  requires
shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act, including any successor to such Rule, shall be effective
unless  such  amendment   shall  be  approved  by  the  requisite  vote  of  the
shareholders  of the  Company  entitled  to vote  thereon.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  any provision of the Plan that either states the amount and price of
securities  to be  issued  under  the  Plan and  specifies  the  timing  of such
issuances,  or sets forth a formula that determines the amount, price and timing
of such issuances,  shall not be amended more than once every six months,  other
than to  comport  with  changes  in the Code,  the  Employee  Retirement  Income
Security Act of 1974, or the rules thereunder.
 
        2     Grants Previously Made.  No termination, amendment or modification
of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Grant previously made
under the Plan,  without the written  consent of the  Participant  holding  such
Grant  unless  such  termination,  modification  or  amendment  is  required  by
applicable law.
 
13.     Restrictions on Share Transferability

        The  Committee  may impose  such  restrictions  on any Shares  acquired
pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the payment of Performance Shares under
the Plan as it may deem advisable,  including, without limitation,  restrictions
to comply with applicable  Federal securities laws, with the requirements of any
stock  exchange or market upon which such Shares are then listed  and/or  traded
and with any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares.

 
14.     Nontransferability

        No Options or  Performance  Shares  granted under the Plan may be sold,
transferred,  pledged,  assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated,  other
than  by  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution.   Further,  a
Participant's  rights  under the Plan  shall be  exercisable  during  his or her
lifetime only by such Participant or his or her legal representative.
 
                                       10

15.     Successors

        All obligations  of the Company under the Plan,  with respect to Grants
made  hereunder,  shall be binding on any successor to the Company,  whether the
existence  of such  successor  is the result of a direct or  indirect  purchase,
merger,  consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company.
 
16.     Legal Construction
 
        1     Gender and Number.  Except where otherwise  indicated by the
context,  any masculine  term used herein also shall  include the feminine,  the
plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.

        2     Severability.  In the event any provision of the Plan shall
be held illegal or invalid for any reason,  the  illegality or invalidity  shall
not affect the remaining  parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
 
        3     Requirements of Law.  Neither the Plan nor the Company shall
be  obligated  to issue any shares of common  stock  pursuant to the Plan at any
time  unless and until all  applicable  requirements  imposed by any federal and
state  securities  and other  laws,  rules and  regulations,  by any  regulatory
agencies  or by any stock  exchanges  upon which the common  stock may be listed
have been fully met.  As a  condition  precedent  to any  issuance  of shares of
common stock and delivery of certificates evidencing such shares pursuant to the
Plan,  the Board or the  Committee  may  require a  Participant to take any such
action or make any such covenants,  agreements and  representations as the Board
or the  Committee,  as the case may be, in its  discretion  deems  necessary  or
advisable to ensure compliance with such  requirements.  The Company shall in no
event be obligated to register the shares of common stock  deliverable under the
Plan  pursuant  to the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  or to qualify or
register such shares under any securities  laws of any state upon their issuance
under the Plan or at any time  thereafter,  or to take any other action in order
to  cause  the  issuance  and  delivery  of such  shares  under  the Plan or any
subsequent offer, sale, or other transfer of such shares to comply with any such
law, regulation or requirement.  Participants are responsible for complying with
all  applicable  federal  and  state  securities  and  other  laws,  rules,  and
regulations in connection with any offer,  sale, or other transfer of the shares
of common stock issued under the Plan or any interest therein including, without
limitation,  compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933 as amended  (unless an  exception  therefrom is  available)  or with the
provisions of Rule 144 promulgated thereunder,  if applicable,  or any successor
provisions.  Certificates  for  shares of common  stock may be  legended  as the
Committee shall deem appropriate.
 
        Notwithstanding  any other provision set forth in the Plan, if required
by the then-current Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any "derivative security" or
"equity security" offered pursuant to the Plan to any Insider may not be sold or
transferred  within the minimum time limits  specified or required in such rule.
The terms "equity  security" and  "derivative  security" shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the then-current Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act.

        4     Securities  Law  Compliance.   With  respect  to  Insiders,
transactions  under  the  Plan  are  intended  to  comply  with  all  applicable
conditions  of the Federal  securities  laws. To the extent any provision of the
Plan or action by the Committee fails to so comply,  it shall be deemed null and
void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee.
 
        Governing  Law. To the extent not  preempted  by Federal law,
the Plan, and all agreements  hereunder,  shall be construed in accordance with,
and governed by, the laws of the State of Minnesota.

                       Directors' Long-Term Incentive Plan

 
                  The plan  awards a maximum  of 600  shares of common  stock to
each  outside  director  if,  over  a  four-year  period  commencing  with  each
even-numbered year, total shareholders return (TSR) equals or exceeds (i) median
TSR compared to a  pre-selected  group of comparable  utilities  (listed  below)
and/or (ii) the 40.0  percentile  TSR  compared to  companies  in the Standard &
Poor's 500. No awards are granted to directors if Company results are below both
of these threshold  performance  levels. The comparison to comparable  utilities
and to the S&P 500 companies is weighted 60% and 40%, respectively.

                  The first comparator group is comprised of:

Midamerican Energy Company
IES Industries, Inc.
Interstate Power Company
Madison Gas & Electric Company
Northern States Power Company
Otter Tail Power Company
Wisconsin Energy Corporation
WPL Holdings, Inc.
Northwestern Public Service Company
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation

                  The second comparator group is the companies comprising the
S&P 500.

                  After  calculation  of the  Company's  TSR ranking  within the
first and second comparator  groups, the schedule below indicates the percent of
the Director's Performance Award Opportunity actually earned.

         TSR is defined as:

                  TSR = Stock price appreciation + reinvested dividends
                        -----------------------------------------------
                                        Initial stock price

         -        Stock prices for the  beginning  and end of the period are the
                  closing prices on the composite  reporting system on the first
                  and last business days of the period.

         -        Dividends are assumed to be reinvested on the ex-dividend
                  date at the closing stock prices on that date.

         -        Calculation of TSR for the S&P 500 group is based on the
                  companies included in the S&P 500 Index as of the end of the
                  period.
