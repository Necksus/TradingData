                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",
"expects",  "intends",  "plans",  "predicts",  "projects", "will likely result",
"will continue",  or similar expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and  may  be  forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:


      - prevailing  governmental  policies and regulatory actions,  including
        those of the FERC,  the MPUC,  the FPSC,  the NCUC and the PSCW,  with
        respect  to  allowed  rates of return,  industry  and rate  structure,
        acquisition  and  disposal  of assets and  facilities,  operation  and
        construction  of plant  facilities,  recovery of  purchased  power and
        other capital  investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and
        retail  competition  (including but not limited to retail wheeling and
        transmission costs);
      - economic and geographic factors including political and economic risks;
      - changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
        policies;
      - weather conditions;
      - population growth rates and demographic patterns;
      - competition for retail and wholesale customers;
      - Year 2000 issues;
        - delays or changes in costs of Year 2000 compliance;
        - failure of major suppliers, customers or others with whom the Company
          does business to resolve their own Year 2000 issues on a timely basis;
      - pricing and transportation of commodities;
      - market demand, including structural market changes;
      - changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
      - changes in project costs;
      - unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
      - capital market conditions;
      - competition for new energy development opportunities; and
      - legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or criminal)
        and settlements  that influence the business and  profitability  of
        the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

NOTE 3.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1995 RATE CASE.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1 million  annual
rate  increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers  of Florida
Water  regulated  by the FPSC.  In October  1996 the FPSC issued its final order
approving an $11.1 million annual  increase.  The new rates were  implemented in
September  1996.  In November  1996 Florida  Water filed with the Florida  First
District Court of Appeals (Court of Appeals) an appeal of the FPSC's final order
seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in
utility facilities recoverable in rates from current customers. Other parties to
the rate case also filed appeals. In the course of the appeals process, the FPSC
reconsidered an issue in its initial decision and, in June 1997, allowed Florida
Water to resume collecting  approximately $1 million, on an annual basis, in new
customer  fees. On June 10, 1998 the Court of Appeals  ruled in Florida  Water's
favor on all material  issues  appealed by Florida Water and remanded the matter
back to the FPSC for action  consistent  with the  Court's  order.  The Court of
Appeals also overturned its decision in Florida Water's 1991 Rate Case which had
required a "functional  relationship" between service areas as a precondition to
implementation  of uniform rates.  On December 15, 1998 the FPSC granted Florida
Water an  additional  annual  revenue  increase of  approximately  $1.2  million
related to several of the issues reversed by the Court of Appeals, and permitted
collection of  approximately  $2.4 million in  surcharges  to reimburse  Florida
Water for revenue (plus interest)  wrongfully  denied in the FPSC's October 1996
order. Florida Water began collecting the new rates in January 1999. Intervenors
protested the surcharge  allocation  methodology.  As a result collection of the
surcharges  is  delayed  and  interest  accumulates  until the FPSC  approves  a
methodology. The FPSC reopened the record on two remaining issues on remand from
the Court of Appeals  regarding the amount of  investment in utility  facilities
recoverable in rates from current customers.  Hearings have been set for January
2000 and  pre-filed  testimony  is due in  November  1999.  On June 14, 1999 the
Company filed a motion  seeking  approval of an offer of  settlement.  The offer
would increase annual revenue by  approximately  $1 million;  place  accumulated
surcharges, including interest accrued through August 1, 1999, into a regulatory
asset recoverable in rate base in the next ratemaking proceeding; and, provide a
three-year  moratorium  on the  initiation  of rate cases by the  Company or the
FPSC,  exclusive  of index  filings.  The motion is scheduled to be heard by the
FPSC on August 23, 1999.  The Company is unable to predict the timing or outcome
of these proceedings.

1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Court of Appeals reversed a 1993 FPSC order
establishing  uniform  rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With
"uniform  rates" all  customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for
water and wastewater  services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order, in
August 1996 the FPSC ordered  Florida Water to issue refunds to those  customers
who paid more since  October 1993 under  uniform rates than they would have paid
under  stand-alone  rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge  to
customers who paid less under uniform  rates.  Florida Water  appealed,  and the
Court of  Appeals  ruled in June  1997 that the FPSC  could  not  order  refunds
without balancing  surcharges.  In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the
FPSC issued an order on January 26, 1998 that did not require  refunds.  Florida
Water's  potential refund liability at that time was about $12.5 million,  which
included interest, to customers who paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 26, 1998 order,  the FPSC  required  Florida Water to refund
$2.5 million,  the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service area from
January  1996 through June 1997 under  uniform  rates which  exceeded the amount
these customers would have paid under a modified stand-alone rate structure.  No
balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund because Spring
Hill customers continued to pay uniform rates after other customers began paying
modified stand-alone rates effective January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's interim
rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case (see Florida Water 1995 Rate Case).
The FPSC did not include Spring Hill in this interim rate order because Hernando
County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida
Water  reached an agreement  with  Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to
stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 26, 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund  because the
FPSC had no authority to order uniform rates.  The Company has appealed the $2.5
million refund order.  Initial briefs were filed by all parties on May 22, 1998.
Upon  issuance of the June 10, 1998 opinion of the Court of Appeals with respect
to  Florida  Water's  1995 Rate  Case  (see  1995 Rate  Case) in which the court
reversed  its  previous  ruling  that the FPSC was  without  authority  to order
uniform rates, customer groups supporting the FPSC's January 1998 order filed

                                      -6-

NOTE 3.    REGULATORY MATTERS - CONTINUED

a motion with the Court of Appeals  seeking  dismissal of the appeal by customer
groups  seeking  refunds.  Customers  seeking  refunds filed  amended  briefs on
September 14, 1998. No provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The Company is
unable to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

ELECTRIC MPUC ORDERS. On July 27, 1999 the MPUC issued an order approving the
Company's Conservation Improvement Program (CIP) filing, except for the recovery
of lost margins which was denied. The annual filing requested approval for a
1998 year end CIP tracker account balance (deferred charge) of $18.9 million;
recovery in 1999 of $3.5 million of 1998 lost margins; and a continuation of the
2.75 percent billing adjustment factor. The MPUC's primary rationale for denial
of lost margin recovery was that in 1998 Electric Operations earned in excess of
its allowed return on equity. In a companion order, the MPUC opened an
investigation into the reasonableness of Minnesota Power's rates. The Company is
required to file within 60 days a report evaluating 1998 electric earnings and
explain why current rates are just and reasonable. The Company intends to
request reconsideration of both orders. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of these matters.


NOTE 4.    ACQUISITIONS

PALM COAST  UTILITIES  CORPORATION.  On January 22, 1999 Florida Water purchased

closing date, except in a single private sale of all or substantially all of the
original shares the Company will receive.

The quarter and six months ended June 30, 1999 included a $24.1 million non-cash
charge,  which reflected the estimated valuation of this transaction at June 30,
1999.  The final  valuation of this  transaction  will be based on the ACE share
price at  closing,  and may  differ  from the  amount  recognized  in the second
quarter of 1999. The charge will be recouped to the extent ACE shares appreciate
over time. The ultimate realized gain or loss on the transaction will occur when
the  Company  sells the ACE  shares.  The  Company  no longer  accounts  for its
investment in Capital Re using the equity method.

NOTE 8.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The  Company has had a power  purchase  agreement  with Square  Butte since 1977
which has  provided a long-term  supply of low-cost  energy to  customers in the
Company's  service  territory and enabled the Company to meet power pool reserve
requirements.  Square  Butte,  a North Dakota  cooperative  corporation,  owns a
455-megawatt  coal-fired  generating unit (Unit) near Center,  North Dakota. The
Unit is adjacent to a generating unit owned by Minnkota Power Cooperative,  Inc.
(Minnkota),  a North Dakota  cooperative  corporation  whose Class A members are
also members of Square  Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of the Unit and
also purchases power from Square Butte.

In May 1998 the  Company  and Square  Butte  entered  into a new power  purchase
agreement (1998 Agreement),  replacing the 1977 agreement.  The Company extended
by 20  years,  to  January  1,  2027,  its  access to  Square  Butte's  low-cost
electricity  and  eliminated  its  unconditional  obligation  for all of  Square
Butte's  costs if not paid by Square  Butte  when due.  The 1998  Agreement  was
reached in conjunction with the termination of Square Butte's previous leveraged
lease financing arrangement and refinancing of associated debt.

Similar  to the  previous  agreement,  the  Company  is  initially  entitled  to
approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under the 1998  Agreement.  After
2005 and upon compliance with a two-year  advance notice  requirement,  Minnkota
has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a
minimum of 50 percent.

Under the 1998 Agreement,  the Company is obligated to pay its pro rata share of
Square  Butte's costs based on the  Company's  entitlement  to Unit output.  The
Company's  payment  obligation is suspended if Square Butte fails to deliver any
power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one year. Under the 1977
agreement the Company was unconditionally obligated to pay all of Square Butte's
costs,  if not paid by Square Butte when due. Square Butte's fixed costs consist
primarily  of debt  service.  At June 30,  1999  Square  Butte  had  total  debt
outstanding  of $343.4  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of the years 1999 through 2002
and $23  million in 2003.  Variable  operating  costs  include the price of coal
purchased  from BNI Coal, a subsidiary  of  Minnesota  Power,  under a long-term
contract. The Company's payments to Square Butte are approved as purchased power
expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


MINNESOTA POWER is a broadly diversified service company with operations in four
business  segments:  (1) Electric  Operations,  which  include  electric and gas
services, coal mining and telecommunications;  (2) Water Services, which include
water and wastewater services; (3) Automotive Services,  which include a network
of vehicle auctions,  a finance company, an auto transport company and a vehicle
remarketing company; and (4) Investments,  which include a securities portfolio,
intermediate-term  investments  and real estate  operations.  Corporate  Charges
represent  general  corporate  expenses,  including  interest,  not specifically
allocated to any one business segment.


CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW

Significant  growth in the  Company's  Water  Services and  Automotive  Services
segments  contributed to higher  operating  results in 1999. For the quarter and
six months ended June 30, 1999,  the Company  reported a $24.1 million  non-cash
charge  associated  with the Company's  investment in Capital Re.  Excluding the
non-cash  charge,  net income for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 1999
increased 14 percent over 1998.  Excluding  the  non-cash  charge,  earnings per
share were $0.38 for the second  quarter of 1999,  an increase of 6 percent over
the prior year period ($0.68 per share for the six months ended June 30, 1999, 5
percent over the prior year  period).  Earnings per share in 1999  reflected the
impact of the  additional  4.2  million  shares of  Common  Stock  issued by the
Company in an underwritten public offering in September 1998.

NET INCOME

The  following  net  income  discussion  summarizes  significant  events for the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 1999.

Electric Operations  reflected reductions in sales to large industrial customers
in 1999. Margins from bulk electric power sales were also lower when compared to
margins  resulting  from the  strong  market in 1998  created by  extremely  hot
weather in June.

Water Services generated higher net income in 1999 due to increased  consumption
as a result of drier weather  conditions and additional  customers from the PCUC
acquisition.  Consumption in the first quarter of 1998 was adversely impacted by
record  rainfall  during that period.  The 1999 results of Water  Services  also
included increased rates approved by the FPSC in December 1998.

Automotive  Services  showed  significant  growth  during  1999.  The  number of
vehicles offered for sale at ADESA auction facilities  increased 10 percent over
the second quarter of 1998 (13 percent over the six months ended June 30, 1998).
Increased  financing  activity and the maturing of loan production  offices that
opened in 1998 at AFC also  contributed  to higher  net income  from  Automotive
Services.

Investments  reported  lower net income in 1999 primarily due to a $24.1 million
non-cash  charge that  reflected  the  estimated  valuation  of the  transaction
between Capital Re and ACE at June 30, 1999.

On May 27, 1999  Capital Re  announced an agreement by which it will be acquired
by ACE Limited  (ACE),  a publicly  traded  company listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol ACL. Under the agreement, Capital Re shareholders will
receive  0.6 shares of ACE for each share of  Capital  Re,  subject to a maximum
value to Capital Re shareholders of $22 per share.  The Company owns 7.3 million
shares,  or 19.9 percent,  of Capital Re. Subject to the maximum  exchange value
upon  closing  (which is  expected  to occur in the  second  half of 1999),  the
Company  will  own  approximately  4.4  million  shares,  or 2  percent  of  the
outstanding  shares,  of ACE.  The  Company  has  agreed to vote in favor of the
merger and not to dispose of the ACE shares  received for 180 days following the
closing date, except in a single private sale of all or substantially all of the
original shares the Company will receive.

The final valuation of this  transaction will be based on the ACE share price at
closing,  and may differ  from the amount  recognized  in the second  quarter of
1999. The charge will be recouped to the extent ACE shares appreciate over time.
The  ultimate  realized  gain or loss on the  transaction  will  occur  when the
Company sells the ACE shares.  The Company no longer accounts for its investment
in Capital Re using the equity method.

Investments  also  reflected  lower net income from  Portfolio  and  Reinsurance
because of stock market volatility affecting returns from short-term investments
during the first  quarter of 1999 and a loss reserve  established  by Capital Re
for reinsurance of securities  issued by CFS. CFS is under  investigation by the
Securities and Exchange  Commission and the Oklahoma  Securities  Commission for
allegations of irregularities  relating to the CFS issued securities.  CFS filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  protection  in December  1998.  In addition, 1998 net
income included  dividend income received from a venture capital  investment and
five large bulk land sales by Real Estate Operations.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 1999 AND 1998

OPERATING REVENUE

Electric  Operations  operating revenue was $5.4 million lower in 1999 primarily
due to a 4 percent reduction in total kilowatthour sales and less demand revenue
from large power customers.  Decreased taconite production,  paper manufacturing
and pipeline usage reduced revenue from large industrial customers in 1999.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 14 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 1999 (16 percent in 1998).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 1999 (6  percent  in 1998).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  and  marketers
accounted for 8 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both 1999 and 1998.

Water  Services  operating  revenue was $4.9 million  higher in 1999,  with $3.5
million of the increase  coming from PCUC which was  purchased in January  1999.
The remainder of the increase resulted from higher rates approved by the FPSC in
December  1998 and more  consumption  due to drier  weather  conditions in 1999.
Overall consumption increased 16 percent in 1999.

Automotive  Services  operating  revenue was $19.2 million higher in 1999 due to
stronger sales at ADESA auction facilities, and increased financing activity and
the maturing of loan production offices opened in 1998 at AFC. ADESA offered for
sale on  consignment  428,000  vehicles  (388,000  in  1998)  at its 29  auction
facilities in 1999 (28 in 1998).  In 1999  financial  results for ADESA auctions
included a full three months of operations from three vehicle auctions  acquired
in late April and May 1998, and two months of operations  from a vehicle auction
acquired  in late  April  1999.  AFC  financed  approximately  174,000  vehicles
(133,000 in 1998) through its 84 loan  production  offices in 1999 (63 in 1998).
AFC financial  results in 1999  included a full three months of operations  from
the 26 loan production offices opened at ADT auctions. Only six of these offices
were open as of June 30, 1998.

Investments  operating  revenue was $8.7 million  lower in 1999.  Portfolio  and
Reinsurance  operating  revenue was $0.7 million  higher in 1999 due to a larger
portfolio  balance.  The Company's  securities  portfolio,  excluding Capital Re
shares,  earned  an  annualized  after-tax  return of 6.8  percent  in 1999 (8.5
percent in 1998).  Real Estate  Operations  operating  revenue was $9.4  million
lower in 1999 because  1998  included two large sales at Palm Coast and the sale
of a partnership interest in a development at Lehigh.  Combined, the three sales
contributed  $6.4 million to revenue in 1998.  The remainder of the decrease was
due to normal fluctuations in Florida real estate sales.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Electric Operations operating expenses were $3.8 million lower in 1999 primarily
due to reductions in fuel and purchased power expenses.  Operating expenses were
also lower in 1999 because the amortization of an early  retirement  program was
completed in July 1998.

Water  Services  operating  expenses  were  $3.0  million  higher in 1999 due to
inclusion of PCUC operations.

Automotive  Services  operating  expenses  were  $14.4  million  higher  in 1999
primarily  due to increased  sales  activity at the auction  facilities  and the
floorplan financing  business.  Additional expenses associated with more auction
facilities and loan  production  offices also  contributed to higher expenses in
1999.

Investments  operating expenses were $4.0 million lower in 1999 primarily due to
fewer sales by Real Estate Operations.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS - NET OF TAX

Income  (loss) from equity  investments  - net of tax was $22.8 million lower in
1999  due to a $24.1  million  non-cash  charge  that  reflected  the  estimated
valuation of the transaction between Capital Re and ACE at June 30, 1999.

COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1999 AND 1998

OPERATING REVENUE

Electric  Operations  operating revenue was $7.3 million lower in 1999 primarily
due to a 4 percent reduction in total kilowatthour sales and less demand revenue
from large power customers.  Decreased taconite production,  paper manufacturing
and pipeline  usage  reduced  revenue from large  industrial  customers in 1999.
Revenue from residential and commercial customers was higher in 1999 because the
winter  weather in Northern  Minnesota  and  Wisconsin  was colder than in 1998.
Sales to other power suppliers in 1999 were about the same as in 1998.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 15 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 1999 (16 percent in 1998).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 1999 (6  percent  in 1998).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  and  marketers
accounted for 7 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both 1999 and 1998.

Water  Services  operating  revenue was $8.6 million  higher in 1999,  with $5.4
million of the increase  coming from PCUC which was  purchased in January  1999.
The remainder of the increase resulted from higher rates approved by the FPSC in
December  1998 and more  consumption  due to drier  weather  conditions in 1999.
Overall  consumption  increased 21 percent in 1999. In 1998 overall  consumption
was lower than normal due to record rainfall during that period.

Automotive  Services  operating  revenue was $39.3 million higher in 1999 due to
stronger sales at ADESA auction facilities, and increased financing activity and
the maturing of loan production offices opened in 1998 at AFC. ADESA offered for
sale on  consignment  824,000  vehicles  (728,000  in  1998)  at its 29  auction
facilities  in 1999  (28 in  1998).  In 1999  ADESA  auction  financial  results
included a full six months of operations from three vehicle auctions acquired in
late April and May 1998,  and two months of  operations  from a vehicle  auction
acquired  in late  April  1999.  AFC  financed  approximately  323,000  vehicles
(253,000 in 1998) through its 84 loan  production  offices in 1999 (63 in 1998).
AFC financial  results in 1999 included a full six months of operations from the
26 loan  production  offices  opened at ADT auctions.  Only six of these offices
were open as of June 30, 1998.

Investments  operating  revenue was $19.7 million  lower in 1999.  Portfolio and
Reinsurance operating revenue was $5.8 million lower in 1999 due to stock market
volatility  affecting  returns  from  short-term   investments.   The  Company's
securities  portfolio,   excluding  Capital  Re  shares,  earned  an  annualized
after-tax return of 3.3 percent in 1999 (6.1 percent in 1998).  Also, revenue in
1998 included $3.9 million of dividend  income  received from a venture  capital
investment.  Real Estate Operations operating revenue was $13.9 million lower in
1999  because  1998  included  four large  sales at Palm Coast and the sale of a
partnership  interest  in a  development  at  Lehigh.  Combined,  the five sales
contributed  $11.5 million to revenue in 1998. The remainder of the decrease was
due to normal fluctuations in Florida real estate sales.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Electric Operations operating expenses were $8.0 million lower in 1999 primarily
due to a reduction in purchased  power  expense.  Operating  expenses  were also
lower in 1999  because  the  amortization  of an early  retirement  program  was
completed in July 1998.

Water  Services  operating  expenses  were  $4.9  million  higher in 1999 due to
inclusion of PCUC operations.

Automotive  Services  operating  expenses  were  $28.0  million  higher  in 1999
primarily  due to increased  sales  activity at the auction  facilities  and the
floorplan financing  business.  Additional expenses associated with more auction
facilities and loan  production  offices also  contributed to higher expenses in
1999.

Investments  operating expenses were $5.8 million lower in 1999 primarily due to
fewer sales by Real Estate Operations.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Corporate  Charges  operating  expenses  were $7.5  million  lower in 1999.  The
decrease is partially  attributed  to less  interest  expense in 1999 because of
smaller  commercial paper balances.  Also,  interest expense in 1998 reflected a
settlement  with the Internal  Revenue  Service on tax issues  relating to prior
years.  As a result of the  settlement,  in the first  quarter  of 1998  amounts
previously  accrued as income tax expense were reversed and recorded as interest
expense. There was no impact on consolidated net income from this transaction.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS - NET OF TAX

Income  (loss) from equity  investments  - net of tax was $21.5 million lower in
1999  due to a $24.1  million  non-cash  charge  that  reflected  the  estimated
valuation of the  transaction  between Capital Re and ACE at June 30, 1999. Also
included in 1999 is a $1.7 million loss  reserve  established  by Capital Re for
reinsurance of securities issued by CFS.

OUTLOOK

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS. On July 27, 1999 the MPUC issued an order approving the
Company's CIP filing, except for the recovery of lost margins which was denied.
The annual filing requested approval for a 1998 year end CIP tracker account
balance (deferred charge) of $18.9 million; recovery in 1999 of $3.5 million of
1998 lost margins; and a continuation of the 2.75 percent billing adjustment
factor. The MPUC's primary rationale for denial of lost margin recovery was that
in 1998 Electric Operations earned in excess of its allowed return on equity. In
a companion order, the MPUC opened an investigation into the reasonableness of
Minnesota Power's rates. The Company is required to file within 60 days a report
evaluating 1998 electric earnings and explain why current rates are just and
reasonable. The Company intends to request reconsideration of both orders. The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.


LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES. Cash flow from operations during the six months ended June
30, 1999 reflected  improved  operating  results and continued  focus on working
capital management. Cash from operating activities was also affected by a number
of factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 9 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA uses commercial paper issued
by the Company to meet short-term working capital  requirements arising from the
timing of payment  obligations to vehicle sellers and the  availability of funds
from vehicle purchasers. During the sales process, ADESA does not typically take
title to vehicles.

AFC also uses proceeds  from the sale of commercial  paper issued by the Company
to meet its operational  requirements.  AFC offers short-term  on-site financing
for dealers to purchase vehicles at auctions in exchange for a security interest
in those vehicles. The financing is provided through the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the vehicle or a general borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC sells
certain   finance   receivables  on  a  revolving   basis  to  a  wholly  owned,
unconsolidated,  qualified special purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn
sells,  on  a  revolving  basis,  an  undivided  interest  in  eligible  finance
receivables,  up to a maximum at any one time outstanding of $225.0 million,  to
third party  purchasers  under an agreement which expires at the end of 2001. At
June  30,  1999 AFC had sold  $291.5  million  of  finance  receivables  to this
subsidiary  ($202.9  million at December 31, 1998).  Third party  purchasers had
purchased an undivided  interest in finance  receivables  of $211.0 million from
this subsidiary at June 30, 1999 ($170.0 million at December 31, 1998). Proceeds
from the sale of the receivables  were used to repay borrowings from the Company
and fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

                                     -14-

<PAGE>

Significant changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at June
30, 1999 compared to December 31, 1998 were due to increased  sales  activity by
Automotive Services. Typically auction volumes are down during the winter months
and in December  because of the  holidays.  As a result,  both ADESA and AFC had
lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

Notes  payable  increased  temporarily  to  finance  Automotive  Services'  cash
requirements due to significant  auction sales and financing growth. The Company
also  used  the  temporary  increase  in notes  payable  and  proceeds  from the
September  1998  issuance of Common Stock to fund the January  1999  purchase of
PCUC.  Florida Water purchased the assets of PCUC from ITT Industries,  Inc. for
$16.8 million plus $1,000 per new water connection for an eight-year period. The
Company estimates the present value of these future water connections to be $5.1
million.

On April 30, 1999 ADESA acquired Des Moines Auto Auction  located in Des Moines,
Iowa. The Company funded this transaction with internally generated funds.

On June 17, 1999 Heater acquired the assets of Mid South of Sherills Ford, North
Carolina for $9 million.  The Company funded this  transaction  with  internally
generated funds and proceeds from a long-term revolving line of credit.

On June 30, 1999 MP Real  Estate  purchased,  for $36.2  million,  certain  real
estate properties  located in Cape Coral,  Florida,  from a subsidiary of Avatar
Holdings Inc. The Company  funded this  transaction  with  internally  generated
funds and proceeds from a long-term revolving line of credit.


CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. Consolidated capital expenditures for the six months ended
June 30, 1999 totaled $42.7 million  ($33.0 million in 1998).  Expenditures  for
1999  included  $20.9  million for Electric  Operations,  $9.3 million for Water
Services and $12.5 million for Automotive  Services.  Internally generated funds
and proceeds from the  September  1998 issuance of Common Stock were the primary
sources of funding for these expenditures.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. (SFAS) 133, "Accounting
for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,"  as amended by SFAS 137,
effective for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be
recorded on the balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair
value.  SFAS  133  requires  that  changes  in the  derivative's  fair  value be
recognized  currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are
met. Special  accounting for qualifying  hedges allows a derivative's  gains and
losses to offset the related  results on the hedged item. The Company  currently
has only a limited amount of derivative activity and adoption of SFAS 133 is not
expected  to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial  position  and
results of operations.


YEAR 2000.  The Year 2000 issue relates to computer  systems that  recognize the
year in a date field using only the last two digits. Unless corrected,  the Year
2000 may be interpreted as 1900, causing errors or shutdowns in computer systems
which may, in turn, disrupt operations.

STATE OF READINESS. The Company has been addressing the Year 2000 issue for over
five years.  In the ordinary course of business,  it has replaced,  or is in the
process of replacing,  many of its major computer  systems with new systems that
have been  designed to be Year 2000  compliant.  These  updated  systems  handle
critical aspects of the Company's  operations,  including energy  management and
generation  control  for  Electric  Operations,  and  customer  information  and
financial management Company-wide.

Each of the  business  segments  has its own  Year  2000  plan,  which  has been
reviewed and is being monitored by a  corporate-level  Year 2000 Risk Assessment
Team.  The  Company's  plan  for  Year  2000  readiness  involves  four  phases:
inventory,  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency  planning.  Testing is an
ongoing  and  integral  part  of the  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency
planning phases.

     INVENTORY.  Each business segment has performed an extensive inventory
     of its  information  technology  systems  and other  systems  that use
     embedded  microprocessors  (collectively,   "Systems").  The  business
     processes  supported by each System have been prioritized based on the
     degree of impact  business  operations  would  encounter if the System
     were disrupted.

                                    -15-
<PAGE>

     The inventory phase also includes  identifying third parties with whom
     the  Company  has  material  relationships.  The  degree to which each
     business  segment  depends  on  third  party  support  varies.   Water
     Services,   Automotive   Services  and  Real  Estate  Operations  have
     identified minimal risk in most areas. Where a third party is critical
     to a business process, efforts have been initiated to obtain Year 2000
     compliance  information  to identify  the degree of risk  exposure the
     Company may encounter.  Electric  Operations is working with its large
     power  customers to share Year 2000  information  and determine  their
     readiness.  In addition,  Electric Operations is working with its fuel
     and transportation  providers in an effort to ensure adequate supplies
     of fuel.

     The internal inventory phase was substantially completed in June 1998.
     Regular  contact with third parties with whom the Company has material
     relationships will continue throughout 1999.

     EVALUATION.  This phase  involves  computer  program  code  review and
     testing,  vendor contacts,  System testing and fully-integrated System
     testing where practical. The objective of this phase is to develop and
     update the  remediation  plan.  Some  Systems,  upon  inspection,  are
     determined  to be  non-compliant  and are  immediately  placed  on the
     remediation  schedule.  Some  Systems  require  testing  to  determine
     compliance status. The evaluation phase was substantially  complete in
     February 1999.

     REMEDIATION.  In this phase each System is either  fixed,  replaced or
     removed.  Critical Systems fixed or replaced are tested again for Year
     2000 readiness.

     The electric  industry is unique in its  reliance on the  integrity of
     the power  pool  grid to  support  and  maintain  reliable,  efficient
     operations.  Preparation  for the Year 2000 by Electric  Operations is
     linked to the Year 2000 compliance  efforts of other utilities as well
     as to those of its major  customers  whose loads support the integrity
     of the power pool grid.  Electric  Operations is coordinating its Year
     2000 efforts with the plans established by the North American Electric
     Reliability  Council (NERC) under the direction of the U.S. Department
     of Energy and is also working with the MAPP Year 2000 Task Force and a
     utility industry consortium to obtain and share  utility-specific Year
     2000 compliance information.

     The Company  estimates that as of August 6, 1999 the remediation phase
     for mission-critical  systems within Electric Operations is 95 percent
     complete.  As  defined  by NERC,  mission-critical  systems  are those
     systems that could be related to the loss of a  50-megawatt  or larger
     generation  source,  the  loss  of  a  transmission  facility  or  the
     interruption  of system load.  With the  exception of certain  systems
     reserved for final  integrated  testing during  scheduled  maintenance
     outages at certain  Company  generating  units at the  Boswell  Energy
     Center in the  second  half of 1999,  the  Company's  mission-critical
     systems used to produce,  deliver and transmit  electricity  are ready
     for date changes associated with Year 2000.

     The Company  estimates that as of August 6, 1999 the remediation phase
     for all business  segment systems is approximately 83 percent complete
     based on the number of systems  remediated.  The bulk of the remaining
     systems are support  systems within  Electric  Operations that are not
     critical to daily operations.  The remediation phase for the Company's
     other business segments was substantially complete in June 1999.

     CONTINGENCY PLANNING.  Each business segment has developed contingency
     plans designed to continue critical processes in the event the Company
     experiences  Year 2000  disruptions  despite  remediation and testing.
     These plans include establishment of internal communications, securing
     adequate on-site  supplies of certain critical  materials and staffing
     for key Year 2000  dates.  Contingency  plans will also be tested when
     appropriate.  Some contingency plans have already  undergone  testing.
     The Company successfully  participated in the April 9, 1999 NERC drill
     which tested inter and intra  backup  communications  for the scenario
     that assumed 10 percent of voice and data  communications  had failed.
     The Company  plans to  participate  in the  September  1999 NERC drill
     which will be a dress  rehearsal for the  millennium  rollover.  As of
     August 6, 1999 the Company estimates the contingency planning phase is
     approximately 87 percent complete.

                                    -16-

COSTS. In the ordinary course of business over the last five years,  the Company
has replaced major business and operating computer systems. These systems should
require  minimal  remediation  efforts  because of their recent  implementation.
Formal Year 2000  readiness  plans were  established  in March 1998.  Since that
time,  the Company  has  incurred  $3 million in  expenses  primarily  for labor
associated  with  inventory,  evaluation and  remediation  efforts.  The Company
estimates its remaining costs to prepare for the Year 2000 will be approximately
$2  million,  the  majority of which are  non-labor  costs that will be incurred
during the  remainder  of 1999.  Funds to  address  Year 2000  issues  have been
provided  for in  the  Company's  existing  budgets.  These  costs  include  the
assignment of existing  personnel to Year 2000 projects,  maintenance and repair
expenses, and capitalized  improvements.  To date no critical projects have been
deferred  because of Year 2000 issues.  The Company does not anticipate that its
costs  associated with Year 2000 readiness will materially  impact the Company's
earnings in any year.

RISKS.  Based upon  information to date, the Company  believes that, in the most
reasonably likely worst-case scenario, Year 2000 issues could result in abnormal
operating   conditions,   such  as  short-term   interruption   of   generation,
transmission and distribution  functions within Electric Operations,  as well as
Company-wide loss of system monitoring and control functions,  and loss of voice
communications.  These  conditions,  along with power  outages  due to  possible
instability of regional electric  transmission  grids, could result in temporary
interruption  of service to customers.  The Company does not believe the overall
impact of this scenario will have a material  impact on its financial  condition
or operations due to the anticipated short-term nature of interruptions.

Readers are cautioned that forward-looking  statements including those contained
above,  should be read in conjunction with the Company's  disclosures  under the
heading:  "SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES  LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995" located in the preface of this Form 10-Q.



ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's  securities portfolio has exposure to both price and interest rate
risk.  Investments held principally for near-term sale are classified as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies,  with utilities being the largest
industry  sector.  Investments  held  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time  are
classified as available-for-sale securities and also recorded at fair value. The
available-for-sale  securities  portfolio  consists  primarily of the  preferred
stock of utilities and financial institutions with investment grade debt ratings
and Capital Re shares. (See Note 5 to the consolidated  financial  statements in
Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.)

In strategies  designed to reduce  market risks,  the Company sells common stock
short and enters into short sales of treasury futures contracts.  Selling common
stock short is intended to reduce price risks  associated with securities in the
Company's trading securities portfolio.  The stock sold short consists primarily
of the stock of companies in similar industries.  Treasury futures are used as a
hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks  associated  with holding  fixed  dividend
preferred  stocks  included  in  the  Company's  available-for-sale   securities
portfolio. Generally, treasury futures contracts mature in 90 days.


June 30, 1999                                                     Fair Value

ITEM 5.    OTHER INFORMATION

Reference is made to the Company's 1998 Form 10-K for background  information on
the following updates.  Unless otherwise indicated,  cited references are to the
Company's 1998 Form 10-K.

Ref. Page 25. - Tenth Paragraph
Ref. 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1999 Page 13. - Fourth and
     Fifth Paragraphs

Steel imports  continue to be a critical issue facing American steel  producers.
Total imports for the first five months of 1999 are running  slightly  below the
record levels of 1998. The surge of imported steel in recent years  continues to
depress  average prices for steel mill  products.  First quarter prices for 1999
are about 27 percent below the same period in 1998.

First quarter steel shipments from American mills are 10 percent lower this year
compared  to the same  period  in 1998,  with  capacity  utilization  also  down
compared to last year.  In 1998 the United  States  imported a record 42 million
tons of steel,  which represented an 83 percent increase over the 23 million ton
average for the previous eight years (1990-1997).

The continued lower worldwide  demand for steel produced in the United States is
likely to have an adverse affect on northern  Minnesota's taconite producers and
the economy of northern Minnesota. The Company is unable to predict the eventual
impact of this issue on the Company's Electric Operations.


Ref. Page 3. - First Full Paragraph
Ref. Page 25. - Eleventh Paragraph

Six of the seven  taconite  producers in Minnesota  have  collective  bargaining
agreements  with the United Steel Workers of America  (USWA).  These  agreements
expire in August 1999. Tentative five-year collective bargaining agreements have
been reached with five of the six USWA taconite producers. Contract negotiations
with the sixth  taconite  producer  have been put on hold pending the outcome of
acquisition discussions with another company.

On July 27, 1999 the MPUC issued an order  approving the Company's CIP filing,
except for the recovery of lost margins which was denied. The annual  filing
requested  approval for a 1998 year end CIP tracker  account balance (deferred
charge) of $18.9 million; recovery in 1999 of $3.5 million of 1998 lost margins;
and a continuation of the 2.75 percent billing  adjustment factor. The MPUC's
primary rationale for denial of lost margin recovery was that in 1998 Electric
Operations earned in excess of its allowed return on equity. In a companion
order, the MPUC opened an investigation into the  reasonableness  of Minnesota
Power's rates.  The Company is required to file within 60 days a report
evaluating  1998 electric  earnings and explain why current  rates are just
and  reasonable. The Company intends to request  reconsideration of both orders.
The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

The Company  anticipates the Minnesota  Pollution  Control Agency will issue new
National Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System Permits (NPDES) for the Boswell
Energy Center in the third quarter of 1999 and the M.L.  Hibbard  Station in the
fourth quarter of 1999.

A new NPDES permit for the Laskin  Energy Center  (Laskin) was issued  effective
April 27, 1999 and has an expiration  date of February 28, 2004. As expected the
Laskin permit contains a schedule of compliance  requiring the construction of a
new ash  disposal  pond by  December  31,  2000.  The  Company  expects to spend
approximately $3.3 million in 1999 and another $3.3 million in 2000 to construct
the Laskin ash disposal pond.

On June 17, 1999  Heater  acquired  the assets of Mid South  located in Sherills
Ford, North Carolina for $9 million. The acquisition was accounted for using the
purchase method.  With the acquisition of Mid South, which serves  approximately
12,000  customers,  Heater  became the largest  investor-owned  water utility in
North Carolina serving almost 45,000 customers in 29 counties.

1995 RATE CASE.  The FPSC reopened the record on two remaining  issues on remand
from the  Florida  First  District  Court of  Appeals  regarding  the  amount of
investment in utility  facilities  recoverable in rates from current  customers.
Hearings  have  been set for  January  2000 and  pre-filed  testimony  is due in
November 1999. On June 14, 1999 the Company filed a motion  seeking  approval of
an offer of settlement. The offer would increase annual revenue by approximately
$1 million;  place accumulated  surcharges,  including  interest accrued through
August 1, 1999, into a  regulatory  asset  recoverable  in rate base in the next
ratemaking proceeding; and, provide a three-year moratorium on the initiation of
rate cases by the Company or the FPSC, exclusive of index filings. The motion is
scheduled to be heard by the FPSC on August 23,  1999.  The Company is unable to
predict the timing or outcome of these proceedings.
