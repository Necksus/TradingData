                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"
"expects,"  "intends,"  "plans,"  "predicts,"  "projects," "will likely result,"
"will continue," or similar  expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

   -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those
      of Congress,  state  legislatures,  the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC
      and the PSCW,  with respect to allowed rates of return,  industry and rate
      structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation
      and  construction  of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased  power and
      other capital investments, and present or prospective wholesale and retail
      competition (including but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission
      costs);
   -  economic and geographic factors including political and economic risks;
   -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;
   -  weather conditions;
   -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;
   -  competition for retail and wholesale customers;
   -  pricing and transportation of commodities;
   -  market demand, including structural market changes;
   -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
   -  changes in project costs;
   -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
   -  capital market conditions;
   -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and
   -  legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal) and
      settlements that influence the business and profitability of the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of these  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of these
factors on the  business or the extent to which any factor,  or  combination  of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Florida First  District Court
of Appeals (Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform
rates for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With  "uniform  rates" all
customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and  wastewater
services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
ordered  Florida Water to issue  refunds to those  customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge to  customers  who paid
less under uniform rates. Florida Water appealed, and the Court of Appeals ruled
in June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without balancing surcharges.
In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC issued an order in January
1998 that did not require refunds. Florida Water's potential refund liability at
that time was about $12.5  million,  which included  interest,  to customers who
paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund,  with
interest,  $2.5 million, the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service
area from January 1996 through June 1997 under uniform rates which  exceeded the
amount  these  customers  would  have paid  under a  modified  stand-alone  rate
structure.  No balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund
because  Spring  Hill  customers  continued  to pay  uniform  rates  after other
customers  began  paying  modified  stand-alone  rates  effective  January  1996
pursuant to the FPSC's interim rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case. The
FPSC did not include  Spring Hill in this  interim rate order  because  Hernando
County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida
Water  reached an agreement  with  Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to
stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund because the FPSC
had no  authority  to order  uniform  rates.  The Company has  appealed the $2.5
million  refund order.  Initial briefs were filed by all parties in May 1998. In
June 1998 the Court of Appeals  reversed its  previous  ruling that the FPSC was
without  authority  to  order  uniform  rates  at  which  time  customer  groups
supporting  the  FPSC's  January  1998  order  filed a motion  with the Court of
Appeals  seeking  dismissal of the appeal by customer  groups  seeking  refunds.
Customers  seeking  refunds filed amended briefs in September  1998. A provision
for refund  related to the $2.5  million  refund order was recorded in the third
quarter of 1999. A decision is not expected  before 2001.  The Company is unable
to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

statements since the date of purchase. Pro forma financial results have not been
presented due to immateriality. The Mission City auction, which has been renamed
ADESA San Diego, operates six auction lanes on 30 acres with full reconditioning
facilities.

The  transactions  described in the three  preceding  paragraphs  had a combined
purchase  price of  approximately  $175.5  million  and  resulted in goodwill of
$145.9  million,  which the Company  expects to amortize  over a 40-year  useful
life. The Company funded these  transactions  with proceeds from the sale of ACE
shares  and  proceeds  from the sale of a portion  of the  Company's  securities
portfolio.

Preferred Stock A, $7.125 Series for an aggregate of $10 million.  Proceeds from
the Company's securities portfolio were used to fund this redemption.

NOTE 9.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company  has a power  purchase  agreement  with  Square  Butte that  extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in the Company's electric service territory and enables the Company to
meet power pool reserve  requirements.  Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center,
North Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit owned by Minnkota Power
Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative corporation whose Class
A members are also members of Square Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of
the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

The Company is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under
the Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance notice
requirement,  Minnkota has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement  by 5
percent  annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  The Company is obligated to pay
its pro rata share of Square Butte's costs based on the Company's entitlement to
Unit output. The Company's payment obligation is suspended if Square Butte fails
to deliver any power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one year.
Square Butte's fixed costs consist  primarily of debt service.  At June 30, 2000
Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $329.6  million.  Total annual debt
service for Square Butte is expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of
the years 2000 through 2003 and $23 million in 2004.  Variable  operating  costs
include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI Coal, a  subsidiary  of Minnesota
Power,  under a long-term  contract.  The Company's payments to Square Butte are
approved as purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and
FERC.

NET INCOME

The following net income discussion  summarizes  significant  events for the six
months ended June 30, 2000.

ELECTRIC   SERVICES   reflected  stable  net  income  in  2000  with  growth  in
megawatthour sales offset by associated expenses.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  reported  higher net income in 2000 due to increased sales
activity at ADESA auctions  facilities and increased financing activity at AFC's
loan  production  offices.  During 2000 ADESA  acquired or opened 16 new vehicle
auction  facilities,  completed the acquisition of 11 salvage auction facilities
and announced plans to purchase 9 additional  vehicle auction  facilities in the
third quarter of 2000.

WATER  SERVICES  generated  higher  net  income in 2000 due to  increased  water
consumption  as a result of drier weather  conditions and customer  growth.  Net
income in 2000 also reflected higher rates approved by the FPSC in 1999.

INVESTMENTS  reported higher net income in 2000 because of significant  sales by
the  Company's  real  estate  operations,  improved  returns  on  the  Company's
securities  portfolio  and gains on  intermediate-term  investments  in emerging
technologies relating to the electric industry.

In May 2000  Minnesota  Power  recorded  a $30.4  million,  or $0.44 per  share,
after-tax gain on the sale of the 4.7 million shares of ACE that Minnesota Power
received  in December  1999 when  Capital Re merged with ACE. As a result of the
merger,  in 1999 Minnesota  Power recorded a $36.2 million,  or $0.52 per share,
after-tax  non-cash  charge as  follows:  a $24.1  million,  or $0.35 per share,
charge in the second quarter  following the merger agreement and  discontinuance
of Minnesota  Power's equity  accounting for Capital Re and a $12.1 million,  or
$0.17 per share, charge in the fourth quarter upon completion of the merger.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 AND 1999

OPERATING REVENUE

ELECTRIC  SERVICES  operating  revenue was up $3.6 million in 2000,  even though
total megawatthour sales were about the same as in 1999. Megawatthour sales from
retail customers were 5 percent higher in 2000 and contributed $3.8 million more
to revenue.  The increase was  primarily due to higher  requirements  from large
industrial   customers.   Megawatthour  sales  from  wholesale  power  marketing
activities  decreased  28 percent in 2000 and  contributed  $2.3 million less to
revenue  due to  cooler  weather  in  2000.  Non-regulated  subsidiaries  within
Electric Services contributed $1.1 million more to revenue in 2000.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 13 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2000 (14 percent in 1999).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in both 2000 and 1999. Sales to other power suppliers accounted for 6 percent of
consolidated operating revenue in 2000 (8 percent in 1999).

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES operating revenue was up $25.7 million in 2000 primarily due
to a 14 percent increase in vehicles sold through ADESA auction facilities and a
16 percent  increase in the number of vehicles  financed at AFC loan  production
offices. At ADESA auction facilities 307,000 vehicles were sold in 2000 (270,000
in 1999).  The  increase  in vehicles  sold was  primarily  attributable  to new
auctions  acquired  or  opened  in 1999 and  2000.  Financial  results  for 2000
included three months of operations for one auction facility acquired in July of
1999, one auction facility acquired in February 2000 and two auction  facilities
opened in April 2000.  Financial  results for 2000 also  reflected  one month of
operations for 11 salvage  auctions  acquired in May 2000 and a partial month of
operations  for 13  auction  facilities  acquired  in June  2000.  AFC  financed
approximately  202,000  vehicles  in 2000  (175,000  in  1999).  AFC had 86 loan
production offices at June 30, 2000 (84 at June 30, 1999).

WATER  SERVICES  operating  revenue was up $1.8  million in 2000 because of a 10
percent increase in water consumption. Drier weather conditions, customer growth
and the  inclusion of water systems  acquired  during 1999 and early 2000 led to
the increase in water consumption. In addition, revenue in 2000 was $0.3 million
higher due to higher rates approved by the FPSC in 1999.

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

INVESTMENTS operating revenue was up $16.8 million in 2000. Significant sales by
the Company's real estate  operations  were the primary reason for the increase.
In 2000  revenue  from real estate  operations  was $15.1  million  higher.  The
increase was  primarily  attributed to four large sales that  contributed  $13.1
million to revenue. Revenue from Investments was also higher due to $2.7 million
of gains on intermediate-term  investments in emerging  technologies relating to
the electric industry.

OPERATING EXPENSES

ELECTRIC SERVICES  operating expenses were up $2.3 million in 2000 primarily due
to increased fuel expense.  Fuel expense was $5.8 million higher in 2000 because
the Company paid higher  prices for coal and generated  422,000,  or 36 percent,
more  megawatthours.  Purchased  power  expense was $3.0  million  lower in 2000
because the Company  purchased  411,000,  or 37  percent,  fewer  megawatthours.
During  1999 one of the  Company's  generating  plants  was  down for  scheduled
maintenance  which forced the Company to incur higher purchased power expense in
1999 to meet requirements.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  operating expenses were up $21.9 million in 2000 primarily
due to the inclusion of new vehicles auctions  facilities  acquired or opened in
late 1999 and 2000.  Increased sales activity at existing auction facilities and
financing  activity at the automobile dealer floorplan  financing  business also
increased operating expenses in 2000.

WATER  SERVICES  operating  expenses  were up $1.3  million  in 2000  due to the
inclusion  of water  systems  acquired  in the second  quarter of 1999 and early
2000.

INVESTMENTS  operating  expenses were up $6.6 million in 2000 due to the cost of
property sold by the Company's real estate operations.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL RE AND RELATED DISPOSITION OF ACE

Income  (loss)  from  investment  in Capital Re and related  disposition  of ACE
reflected  a $48  million  gain on the  disposition  of ACE shares in 2000 and a
$16.1 million  non-cash charge  associated with the loss on the Capital Re share
exchange at June 30, 1999.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

Income tax expense was up $14.6 million in 2000 primarily due to the gain on the
disposition  of ACE shares and increased  operating  income.  In 1999 income tax
expense  included the  recognition of $15.0 million of deferred taxes related to
the Company's investment in Capital Re.

COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 AND 1999

OPERATING REVENUE

ELECTRIC  SERVICES  operating revenue was up $13.0 million in 2000 primarily due
to a 5 percent increase in megawatthour  sales.  More sales from wholesale power
marketing  activities and higher requirements by large industrial  customers led
to the increase in megawatthour  sales.  Megawatthour sales from wholesale power
marketing  activities  increased 6 percent in 2000 and contributed  $2.1 million
more to revenue,  while megawatthour sales to industrial  customers  increased 5
percent in 2000 and  contributed  $4.4 million more to revenue.  Residential and
commercial  megawatthour  sales were up 2 percent in 2000 and  contributed  $1.8
million more to revenue. In addition, non-regulated subsidiaries within Electric
Services contributed $1.9 million more to revenue in 2000.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 13 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2000 (15 percent in 1999).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in both 2000 and 1999. Sales to other power suppliers accounted for 6 percent of
consolidated operating revenue in 2000 (7 percent in 1999).

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES operating revenue was up $48.4 million in 2000 primarily due
to a 14 percent increase in vehicles sold through ADESA auction facilities and a
23 percent  increase in the number of vehicles  financed at AFC loan  production
offices. At ADESA auction facilities 602,000 vehicles were sold in 2000 (530,000
in 1999).  The  increase  in vehicles  sold was  primarily  attributable  to new
auctions  acquired  or  opened  in 1999 and  2000.  Financial  results  for 2000
included six months of operations for two auction  facilities  acquired in 1999,
five months of operations for one auction facility acquired in February 2000 and
three  months of  operations  for two auction  facilities  opened in April 2000.
Financial results for 2000 also reflected one month of operations for 11 salvage
auctions  acquired in May 2000 and a partial month of operations  for 13 auction
facilities acquired in June 2000. AFC financed approximately 397,000 vehicles in
2000 (323,000 in 1999). AFC had 86 loan production  offices at June 30, 2000 (84
at June 30, 1999).

WATER  SERVICES  operating  revenue was up $5.4  million in 2000 because of a 13
percent increase in water consumption. Drier weather conditions, customer growth
and the  inclusion of water systems  acquired  during 1999 and early 2000 led to
the increase in water consumption. In addition, revenue in 2000 was $0.5 million
higher due to higher rates approved by the FPSC in 1999.

INVESTMENTS operating revenue was up $46.0 million in 2000. Significant sales by
the Company's real estate  operations  were the primary reason for the increase.
In 2000 seven large sales contributed $31.9 million to revenue. Improved returns
from the securities portfolio and the $6.3 million of gains on intermediate-term
investments  in emerging  technologies  relating to the electric  industry  also
contributed to higher operating  revenue from Investments in 2000. The Company's
securities  portfolio recorded an after-tax return of 6.02 percent in 2000 (3.32
percent in 1999).

OPERATING EXPENSES

ELECTRIC SERVICES operating expenses were up $12.0 million in 2000 primarily due
to increased fuel and purchased  power  expenses.  Fuel expense was $5.8 million
higher in 2000  because the Company  paid higher  prices for coal and  generated
418,000, or 15 percent, more megawatthours to support the higher requirements of
industrial retail customers.  Purchased power expense was $4.2 million higher in
2000 because of increased prices in the wholesale market and more  megawatthours
bought to meet MPEX's marketing activities in the first quarter of 2000. MPEX is
the Company's wholesale power marketing division.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  operating expenses were up $41.1 million in 2000 primarily
due to the inclusion of new vehicles auctions  facilities  acquired or opened in
1999 and 2000.  Increased sales activity at the auction facilities and financing
activity at the automobile  dealer floorplan  financing  business also increased
operating expenses in 2000.

WATER  SERVICES  operating  expenses  were up $4.1  million  in 2000  due to the
inclusion  of water  systems  acquired  in the second  quarter of 1999 and early
2000.

INVESTMENTS  operating expenses were up $17.6 million in 2000 due to the cost of
property sold by the Company's real estate operations.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL RE AND RELATED DISPOSITION OF ACE

Income  (loss)  from  investment  in Capital Re and related  disposition  of ACE
reflected  a $48  million  gain on the  disposition  of ACE shares in 2000 and a
$16.1 million  non-cash charge  associated with the loss on the Capital Re share
exchange at June 30, 1999.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

Income tax expense was up $27.6 million in 2000 primarily due to the gain on the
disposition of the ACE shares and increased operating income. In 1999 income tax
expense  included the  recognition of $15.0 million of deferred taxes related to
the Company's investment in Capital Re.

OUTLOOK

ELECTRIC  SERVICES.  As the  electric  industry  continues to  restructure,  the
contribution  from  Electric  Services is expected to remain stable with a solid
customer base.  Approximately  half of the  electricity  the Company sells is to
Large  Power  Customers,  primarily  taconite  producers,  which have  long-term
all-requirements  contracts.  Approximately  80 percent of the ore  consumed  by
integrated  steel  facilities  in the Great Lakes  region  originates  from five
taconite customers of Minnesota Power.

On May 24, 2000 LTV announced its  intention to close  permanently  its taconite
pellet  operation  in Hoyt  Lakes,  Minnesota  because  it is no longer  able to
provide taconite pellets of competitive quality or cost. The financial impact of
the LTV closure on Minnesota  Power is minimal  because LTV is not a Large Power
Customer. LTV plans to close in the summer of 2001.

The domestic steel industry  continues to face high levels of imported products.
Through May 2000,  finished  steel  imports,  at  12,599,000  net tons,  were 17
percent  higher  than in the same period in 1999 and remain on pace to exceed 30
million tons this year. In 1999 the United States  imported  35,657,000  tons of
steel,  higher than any year except 1998.  Overall steel prices remain  somewhat
depressed.

On a national level,  despite the high level of imports, the strong U.S. economy
continues to help fuel demand for domestically produced steel.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES. ADESA is the second largest and the fastest growing vehicle
auction business in North America.  In May 2000 ADESA purchased the remaining 27
percent  ownership  in Impact  Auto,  which  added 11  salvage  auctions  to the
Automotive Services segment.  The June 2000 acquisition of AFG added 13 Canadian
vehicle auction facilities and associated dealer financing business to ADESA and
established  ADESA as the premier  automotive  services  company in Canada.  The
ADESA/Manheim  transaction,  which is scheduled to close in the third quarter of
2000, will add nine vehicle auction  facilities to ADESA. These acquisitions are
expected to increase the number of vehicles  sold by 60 percent in the near term
with additional growth potential in the future. ADESA currently owns (or leases)
and operates 45 vehicle  auction  facilities  throughout  the United  States and
Canada.  Once the Manheim transaction closes and operations begin at the Calgary
auction,  which  is under  construction,  ADESA  will  have 55  vehicle  auction
facilities.  By the end of 2000 AFC will exit 17 of the 21 ADT auctions where it
now has loan production offices. AFC plans to continue to serve these areas from
newly established loan production  offices or from other existing  offices.  AFC
does not anticipate that the relocations will have a material financial impact.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES. Cash flow from operations during the six months ended June
30, 2000 reflected  improved  operating  results and continued  focus on working
capital management. Cash from operating activities was also affected by a number
of factors representative of normal operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper. In addition,  securities  investments
can be liquidated to provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or
acquisition of new businesses and  approximately 6 million original issue shares
of Common Stock are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for  services  provided.  However,  ADESA has  arrangements  to use the
proceeds  from  the sale of  commercial  paper  issued  by the  Company  to meet
short-term  working  capital  requirements  arising  from the  timing of payment
obligations  to vehicle  sellers  and the  availability  of funds  from  vehicle
purchasers.  During the sales  process,  ADESA does not typically  take title to
vehicles.

AFC also has  arrangements  to use proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper
issued  by  the  Company  to  meet  its  operational  requirements.  AFC  offers
short-term  on-site  financing  for dealers to purchase  vehicles at auctions in
exchange for a security  interest in those  vehicles.  The financing is provided
through  the  earlier  of the date the  dealer  sells the  vehicle  or a general
borrowing  term of 30 to 45 days.  AFC sells certain  finance  receivables  on a
revolving  basis to a wholly owned,  unconsolidated,  qualified  special purpose
subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn sells,  on a revolving  basis, an undivided
interest  in  eligible  finance  receivables,  up to a  maximum  at any one time
outstanding of $300 million,  to third party

                                      -13-


<PAGE>

purchasers under an agreement which expires at the end of 2002. At June 30, 2000
AFC had sold  $333.1  million  of finance  receivables  to the  special  purpose
subsidiary  ($296.8  million at December 31, 1999).  Third party  purchasers had
purchased an undivided interest in finance receivables of $237 million from this
subsidiary at June 30, 2000 ($225 million at December 31, 1999).  Unsold finance
receivables  held by the  special  purpose  subsidiary  are  recorded  by AFC as
residual  interest at fair value.  Fair value is based upon  estimates of future
cash flows,  using assumptions that market  participants would use to value such
instruments,  including  estimates of anticipated credit losses over the life of
the receivables  sold; a discount rate was not used due to the short-term nature
of the  receivables  sold. The fair value of AFC's  residual  interest was $79.5
million at June 30, 2000 ($57.6 million at December 31, 1999). Proceeds from the
sale of the receivables  were used to repay borrowings from the Company and fund
vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at June
30, 2000 compared to December 31, 1999 were due to increased sales and financing
activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down during the
winter months and in December because of the holidays.  As a result,  both ADESA
and AFC had lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

SALE OF INVESTMENTS.  In May 2000 Minnesota Power sold its 4.7 million shares of
ACE. Minnesota Power received the ACE shares and $25 million in cash in December
1999 when Capital Re merged with ACE. Prior to the merger, Minnesota Power owned
7.3 million shares,  or 20 percent,  of Capital Re. The $127 million in proceeds
from the sale of ACE  shares  and  proceeds  from the sale of a  portion  of the
Company's  securities  portfolio were used to fund the  acquisitions  of AFG and
Impact Auto.

ACQUISITIONS.  In February 2000 ADESA purchased the Mission City Auto Auction in
San Diego,  California.  The Mission City auction,  which has been renamed ADESA
San Diego,  operates  six  auction  lanes on 30 acres  with full  reconditioning
facilities.

In May 2000 ADESA  Canada  purchased  the  remaining  27 percent of Impact Auto.
ADESA Canada  acquired 20 percent of Impact Auto on October 1, 1995,  27 percent
in March 1999 and another 26 percent in January 2000. Impact is Canada's largest
national  salvage  auction  chain with 11 sites in six  provinces.  Impact  Auto
provides  remarketing  services to  insurance  companies  for their "total loss"
vehicles.

In June 2000 ADESA  acquired all of the  outstanding  common shares of AFG. AFG,
which is headquartered in Miami,  Florida, owns CAAG Auto Auction Holdings Ltd.,
a wholesale  automotive  remarketing  company with locations  throughout Canada,
doing  business as  Canadian  Auction  Group.  The  acquisition  of AFG added 13
vehicle auction  facilities and associated dealer financing  business to ADESA's
existing  locations and  established  ADESA as the premier  automotive  services
company in Canada.

The  transactions  described in the three  preceding  paragraphs  had a combined
purchase  price of  approximately  $175.5  million.  The  Company  funded  these
transactions  with  proceeds  from the sale of ACE shares and proceeds  from the
sale of a portion of the Company's securities portfolio.

In July 2000 ADESA signed a definitive  agreement  with Manheim to buy eight ADT
auctions  and one Manheim  auction for $251  million.  In January  2000  Manheim
agreed to  purchase 28 ADT  auctions.  Following  FTC review of the  Manheim/ADT
transaction, Manheim agreed to sell the nine auctions ADESA intends to purchase.
The ADESA/Manheim transaction is subject to approval by the FTC and satisfaction
of various  other  customary  conditions.  Closing is  anticipated  in the third
quarter of 2000.  The  Company  expects to finance the  transaction  through the
issuance of long-term  debt.  As a result of these  transactions,  by the end of
2000 AFC will exit 17 of the 21 ADT  auctions  where it now has loan  production
offices.  AFC plans to continue to serve these areas from newly established loan
production offices or from other existing offices.  AFC does not anticipate that
the relocations will have a material financial impact.

In June 2000  Florida  Water  purchased  the  assets  of  Spruce  Creek for $5.5
million,  plus a commitment to pay fees for water connections through June 2005.
Spruce  Creek  serves  3,100  water  and  2,500  wastewater  customers  in three
communities  in Marion  County,  Florida.  The systems  acquired are designed to
accommodate   10,000  customers.   The  Company  funded  this  transaction  with
internally generated funds.

LONG-TERM  DEBT.  In March 2000 ADESA issued $35 million of 8.10% Senior  Notes,
Series B, due March 30, 2010.  Proceeds were used to refinance  short-term  bank
indebtedness   incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  vehicle  auction  facilities
purchased in 1999 and for general corporate purposes.

In June 2000 Minnesota Power refinanced $4.6 million of 6.875% Pollution Control
Revenue  Refunding  Bonds,  Series 1991-A with $4.6 million of  Adjustable  Rate
Pollution  Control Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 2000 due December 1, 2015. The
new bonds had an initial rate of 4.75%.

In June 2000 Heater issued an $8 million,  8.24%, note to COBANK,  ACB, due June
20, 2025. Proceeds were used to refinance short-term  indebtedness  incurred for
the 1999 acquisition of Mid South and capital improvements in 1999 and 2000.

On July  21,  2000  the  Company  filed a  registration  statement  with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 415 under the  Securities  Act of 1933 for an aggregate of $400
million of first mortgage bonds and debt securities.  The registration statement
has not yet been declared  effective by the SEC. Any offer and sale of the first
mortgage bonds and debt securities will be made only by means of a prospectus.

PREFERRED  STOCK.  In April 2000 the  Company  redeemed  all  100,000  shares of
Redeemable  Serial  Preferred  Stock A, $7.125  Series for an  aggregate  of $10
million.  In July 2000 the Company  redeemed  all 100,000  shares of  Redeemable
Serial Preferred Stock A, $6.70 Series for an aggregate of $10 million. Proceeds
from the sale of a portion of the Company's  securities  portfolio  were used to
fund these redemptions.

In July 2000 the Company called all 113,358  outstanding  shares of 5% Preferred
Stock at $102.50 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends of $0.75 per share.
The redemption date is August 24, 2000.  Internally generated funds will be used
to fund this redemption.

LEASES.  In April  2000  leases  for three  ADESA  auction  facilities  (Boston,
Charlotte and  Knoxville)  were  refinanced in a $28.4 million  leveraged  lease
transaction. The new lease expires on April 1, 2010, but may be terminated after
2005  under  certain   conditions.   Minnesota  Power  has  guaranteed   ADESA's
obligations under the lease.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. Consolidated capital expenditures for the six months ended
June 30, 2000 totaled $56.5 million  ($42.7 million in 1999).  Expenditures  for
2000 included $20.4 million for Electric Services,  $24.5 million for Automotive
Services and $11.6 million for Water  Services.  Internally  generated funds and
the  issuance of  long-term  debt were the primary  sources of funding for these
expenditures.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 1998 the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  (SFAS) 133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities,"  as amended by SFAS 137,  effective  for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes  accounting and
reporting  standards  requiring that every derivative  instrument be recorded on
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair value.  SFAS
133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently
in  earnings  unless  specific  hedge  accounting   criteria  are  met.  Special
accounting  for  qualifying  hedges  allows a  derivative's  gains and losses to
offset the related results on the hedged item. The Company currently believes it
has only a limited amount of derivative activity and adoption of SFAS 133 is not
expected  to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial  position  and
results of operations.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's  securities portfolio has exposure to both price and interest rate
risk.  Investments held principally for near-term sale are classified as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies.  In strategies  designed to hedge
overall  market  risks,  the Company also sells common stock short.  Investments
held for an  indeterminate  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale
securities  and  also  recorded  at fair  value.  Available-for-sale  securities
consisted of securities in a grantor trust  established to fund certain employee
benefits.  In May 2000 Minnesota  Power sold its entire  investment in ACE. (See
Note 6.)

Paragraphs

The domestic steel industry  continues to face high levels of imported products.
Through May 2000,  finished  steel  imports,  at  12,599,000  net tons,  were 17
percent  higher  than in the same period in 1999 and remain on pace to exceed 30
million tons this year. In 1999 the United States  imported  35,657,000  tons of
steel,  higher than any year except 1998.  Overall steel prices remain  somewhat
depressed.

On a national level,  despite the high level of imports, the strong U.S. economy
continues to help fuel demand for domestically produced steel.

On May 24, 2000 LTV announced its  intention to close  permanently  its taconite
pellet  operation  in Hoyt  Lakes,  Minnesota  because  it is no longer  able to
provide taconite pellets of competitive quality or cost. The financial impact of
the  LTV  closure  on  Minnesota   Power  is  minimal   because  LTV  is  not  a
full-requirements customer. LTV plans to close in the summer of 2001.

On July 28, 2000 ADESA signed a definitive  agreement  with Manheim to buy eight
ADT auctions and one Manheim  auction for $251 million.  In January 2000 Manheim
agreed to  purchase 28 ADT  auctions.  Following  FTC review of the  Manheim/ADT
transaction, Manheim agreed to sell the nine auctions ADESA intends to purchase.
The ADESA/Manheim transaction is subject to approval by the FTC and satisfaction
of various  other  customary  conditions.  Closing is  anticipated  in the third
quarter of 2000.  The  Company  expects to finance the  transaction  through the
issuance of long-term  debt.  As a result of these  transactions,  by the end of
2000 AFC will exit 17 of the 21 ADT  auctions  where it now has loan  production
offices.  AFC plans to continue to serve these areas from newly established loan
production offices or from other existing offices.  AFC does not anticipate that
the relocations will have a material financial impact.

a.       Split Rock shall  provide  services that are  necessary and appropriate
to  economically  commit and dispatch the  Members'  Generation  Resources on an
integrated basis to serve the Members'  combined End-Use Load and any Off-System
Transactions arranged by Split Rock on behalf of itself and/or the Member(s). In
order to  effectuate  a  least-cost,  economic  dispatch,  MP shall  operate its
Generation  Resources  consistent  with  Split  Rock's  instructions;  provided,
however, as to such MP Generation  Resources,  MP operators may take any and all
actions that they reasonably believe, based on the circumstances and information
available  to them at the  time,  are  necessary  and  appropriate  to  avoid or
alleviate emergency conditions or to protect the safety of persons or property.

b.       MP shall  provide  and  maintain,  at its own  expense,  in  accordance
with  specifications  and  procedures   satisfactory  to  meet  its  obligations
hereunder,  such  telecommunications and other facilities at its premises as are
necessary  to transfer  data  relating to its  Generation  Resources,  and other
necessary operating data, to and from the Split Rock Scheduling Center.

c.       Split Rock shall operate and  maintain a Scheduling Center as necessary
to commit and dispatch the Members' Generating Resources to serve their combined
End-Use Loads on an economic  basis and to  consolidate  Split Rock's and/or the
Members' wholesale trading, marketing and scheduling activities.

d.       Should MP or any other Member provide notice of its intent to retire,
dispose  of, or let lapse any of its  Generation  Resources,  Split  Rock  shall
recommend  to the  Members  alternative  generation  resources  to replace  such
retired, disposed, or lapsed Generation Resources.

Section 4.02      Ownership and Maintenance of Generation Resources.

a.       MP shall have the  responsibility, at its cost, to operate and maintain
its Generation  Resources,  including  maintaining any necessary  accreditation,
consistent with Good Utility  Practice and any operating  practices or protocols
implemented by Split Rock pursuant to this AGREEMENT.

b.       MP may retire or  dispose of any of its  existing Generation Resources,
or choose not to renew or extend the  contractual  arrangements  for  Generation
Resources  under contract,  upon  reasonable  notice to Split Rock and the other
Members, and MP shall have no obligation to Split Rock or the Members to replace
any retired, disposed or lapsed Generation Resource.

c.       Should an event of Force Majeure or other event of partial or complete
outage of MP's Generation  Resources  occur, MP shall  immediately  notify Split
Rock and the other  Members  of such  event,  its  expected  duration,  and MP's
intentions  to address such event.  During such Force Majeure  events,  MP shall
take all reasonable  actions,  in  coordination  with Split Rock, to restore the
operation and rating of any Generation Resource adversely affected by such Force
Majeure events.

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

d.       Should MP experience an outage of any of its  Generation Resources that
may affect the ability of Split Rock to fulfill its responsibilities  under this
AGREEMENT or any applicable prevailing regional reliability requirements,  Split
Rock will  take any  actions  that it  reasonably  believes  are  necessary  and
appropriate  to obtain  replacement  capacity  or energy  from other  resources.
Unless other arrangements have been made and agreed to by the other Members, the
cost of such replacement capacity and energy shall be borne by MP.

e.       MP shall be responsible for procuring any fuel or other resources
needed for the operation of its  Generation  Resources and for  maintaining  and
administering  any  contacts  for the  purchase  and  delivery  of such  fuel or
resources;   provided,   however,   that  consistent  with  any  confidentiality
obligations or  restrictions,  MP shall  coordinate  with Split Rock and provide
such  information as may be reasonably  necessary for Split Rock to maximize the
Members' efficient use and procurement of fuel and other resources.

                              END-USE LOAD SERVICE

Section 5.01      Split Rock Obligations.

         As provided for in Section 6.4.3(f) of the MAPP Restated Agreement,  MP
hereby assigns to Split Rock, and Split Rock hereby accepts such assignment from
MP,  all  of  MP's  End-Use  Load  Obligation.   Notwithstanding   Split  Rock's
obligations hereunder, MP at all times retains all of the rights and obligations
it may have under its own contracts to provide  electric service to MP's End-Use
Loads, including contracts with municipal electric utility customers.

Section 5.02.     Dispatch to Serve Other Members.

         In the event  that  Split  Rock's  dispatch  directions  result in MP's
Generation  Resources  being used to serve end-use Loads other than MP's End-Use
Load or other Members' Off-System Transactions, MP shall sell to Split Rock that
capacity or energy transferred to serve such other Members' requirements,  under
MP's  market-based  rate  tariff.  In  the  event  that  Split  Rock's  dispatch
directions result in MP's End-Use Load or Off-System  Transactions  being served
from the capacity and energy of other Members'  Generation  Resources,  MP shall
purchase  from Split Rock that  capacity  and energy  transferred  to serve MP's
requirements.  To the extent that Split Rock's dispatch directions result in the
need to serve all or a portion of MP's End-Use Load or  Off-System  Transactions
other than from MP's  Generation  Resources,  MP shall purchase that capacity or
energy to serve those requirements at the price,  terms, and conditions for such
transactions   determined  in  accordance  with  transfer   pricing   principles
established by Split Rock and approved by the Members.  Such transactions  shall
be identified by Split Rock, and shall be accounted for and settled  between the
Members on a monthly basis.

Section 5.03      Generation Resource Obligations.

         MP shall designate a level of Generation Resources,  and be required to
operate and maintain  such  Generation  Resources  consistent  with Good Utility

scheduling  and dispatch  services for MP in  connection  with these  Off-System
Transactions.

Section 6.02      Marketing of MP's Power Resources.

         Split Rock shall market the excess Power available from MP's Generation
Resources, including the purchase and resale of Power from non-Members, with the
goal to maximize the economic value of MP's Generation  Resources and reduce the
cost to MP of serving MP's End-Use Loads. Split Rock may fulfill its obligations
hereunder by contracting  with MPEX under the Wholesale  Marketing and Operating
Services Agreement Between MPEX and Split Rock Energy LLC.

Section 6.03.     Purchase and Resale of Members' Excess Power.

         MP hereby  grants to Split Rock the  exclusive  option to purchase  for
resale to non-Member  customers any excess Power  available from MP's Generation
Resources,  after  deduction  for the Power  dispatched  from  those  Generation
Resources to serve MP's End-Use Loads, any existing MP Off-System  Transactions,
and any released energy  available as a result of arrangements  with MP's retail
customers.  The Power for any such sales to  non-Members  shall be dispatched as
part of Split Rock's dispatch  services under this AGREEMENT,  and shall be sold
by MP to Split Rock under MP's  market-based  rate tariff at the transfer  price
and under the terms and conditions agreed to by the Members.  If Split Rock does
not  exercise its option  hereunder  to purchase  excess Power from MP, MP shall
have the right,  consistent with its other obligations under this AGREEMENT,  to
separately  enter  into  transactions  with third  parties  for the sale of such
excess Power.

Section 6.04      Duration of Split Rock's Contracts to Supply Power to
                  Non-Members.

         No transaction for the purchase or sale of Power between Split Rock and
non-Members  shall have a duration longer than the notice period for terminating
this AGREEMENT unless one or more of the Members agrees in writing to assume the
obligation  to provide  service  and assume any and all  liabilities  under such
transactions  after the  dissolution  of Split Rock and the  termination of this
AGREEMENT.

         MP and  Split  Rock,  in  conjunction  with the  other  Members,  shall
mutually  cooperate in preparation of Split Rock's MAPP membership  application,

of that process, MP shall prepare and submit to MAPP an application for a change
in its MAPP membership status consistent with Split Rock's assumption of End-Use
Load Obligation and Reliability Membership for MP's End-Use Loads and Generation
Resources. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MP intends to participate in MAPP as a
Transmission Owning Member.

         Section 7.02.1  Change in MAPP Membership Status.

         If,  during  the term of this  AGREEMENT,  (a) MP  ceases  to be a MAPP
         Member,  (b) the MAPP  Agreement is terminated or materially  modified,
         (c) some or all of MAPP's  functions and  responsibilities  are assumed
         under a successor or different  organization  or entity,  all terms and
         conditions  with  respect to MAPP shall remain in force until new terms
         and conditions are mutually agreed upon by the Members.

Section 7.03      Costs of MAPP Membership.

         The costs of Split  Rock's  application  to and  participation  in MAPP
shall be  considered  a Split Rock cost and shall be charged to MP and the other
Members pursuant to this AGREEMENT.

         Split  Rock shall  adopt  principles  and  procedures  to  address  the
scheduling of MP's Generation Resources, metering,  record-keeping, and electric
systems coordination.

Section 8.03      Information Requirements.

         The Parties shall maintain records reflecting hourly schedules of power
and  energy  generated  and  actual  deliveries  of  power  and  energy  from MP

the other Members upon request.  Nothing in this AGREEMENT shall obligate either
Party to retain records longer than the period prescribed by FERC, RUS, MAPP, or
other applicable regulatory body, reliability council or operational standard.

                                   TERMINATION

Section 9.01      Notice of Termination.

         This  AGREEMENT  may be  terminated  by MP upon one  year's  notice  of
termination,  provided,  however,  that such  termination  shall not take effect
between May 1 and September 30 of any year. Termination will be effective on the
first day of the month, and written notice of termination must be given at least
one year prior to the first day of the month  that MP intends  for its notice to
become  effective  and for the  AGREEMENT  to  terminate.  Upon  termination  in
accordance  with this  Section  9.01,  MP shall be excused  and  relieved of all
obligations  and  liabilities  under this  AGREEMENT,  except those  liabilities
incurred  before  the  effective  date  of  termination  or as a  result  of the
termination.  Each  Party  shall use every  reasonable  effort to  mitigate  any
damages resulting from a breach and/or termination of this AGREEMENT.

Section 9.02      Effect of Termination.

         If,  upon  termination  of this  AGREEMENT,  the  Parties are unable to
mutually agree as to the effects of termination, any dispute over the effects of
termination  shall be  resolved  through  arbitration  under  Section 11 of this
AGREEMENT.  The Parties shall allocate the responsibility for purchase and sales
obligations  under  Split  Rock  contracts  outstanding  as  of  termination  in
accordance  with  principles to be adopted and  implemented by the Members.  The
termination  of this  AGREEMENT  shall  not  discharge  either  Party  from  any
obligation  it owes  to the  other  or to any  other  Member  by  reason  of any
transaction,  cost, damage, expense,  investment, or liability which shall occur
or arise prior to such termination.  The Parties intend that any such obligation
owed  (whether  the same shall be known or unknown  at the  termination  of this

Section 10.01     Continuity of Operation.

a.       Unless otherwise  directed by Split Rock as part of its integrated
dispatch,  the  operating  performance  of MP's  electrical  system  under  this

(1)      Interruptions or reductions due to Force Majeure, which, by exercise of
due diligence and foresight, could not reasonably have been avoided.

(2)      Interruptions or reductions due to operation of devices installed for
power system protection.

(3)      Temporary  interruptions or reductions which are necessary or desirable
for  the  purposes  of  maintenance,  repairs,  replacements,   installation  of
equipment or  investigation  and  inspection.  MP will give Split Rock and other
Members reasonable advance notice of such interruptions or reductions, except in
cases  of  emergency  make  such  advance  notice  impracticable  as  reasonably
determined  by MP, and MP will use best  reasonable  efforts to remove the cause
thereof as quickly as practicable under the circumstances.

b.       The Party  prevented from  performing its  obligations for any of the
reasons set forth in Section  10.01(a),  above,  shall exercise Due Diligence in
attempting  to remove the cause of its  failure to perform,  and nothing  herein
shall be construed as permitting that Party to continue to fail to perform after
said cause has been removed;  however, the Party shall not be obligated to agree
to any  settlement  of a strike or labor  dispute  which,  in that  Party's sole
discretion, may be inadvisable or detrimental to its interests.

Section 10.02.    Character of Power and Energy.

         All deliveries of electric power and energy  hereunder  shall be of the
character  commonly known as three-phase,  sixty-Hertz power and energy,  unless

successors  and assigns,  on and after the  effective  date hereof.  None of the
provisions of this AGREEMENT, whether in whole or in part, shall be assigned nor
their performance  delegated by any Party to any third party without the written
consent of the other,  which  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld,  unless such
assignment  is to an affiliate  or successor  that assumes all of the rights and
obligations  hereunder so long as such assignment would not adversely affect any
of the federal,  state or reliability  council approvals or findings required or
in place for Split Rock's operations under this AGREEMENT.

Section 10.06     Billing and Payment Procedure.

         Unless governed by separate written  agreement,  the Parties shall bill
and make payments in accordance with the following procedures:

a.       The Party (selling Party) providing any billable  services to the other
Party  (buying  Party) shall issue an invoice by the fifteenth of each month for
services provided during the previous month.

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

b.       The buying  Party's  payments to the selling Party shall be due if by
mail at the selling Party's general office, or if by wire transfer to a bank and
account  named by the selling  Party,  no later than fifteen days  following the
date of the invoice,  but such  payment  shall not be due before the 20th day of
the month.  The buying  Party  shall have the right to dispute the amount of any
such invoice by protest on or before the payment  date,  but such dispute  shall
not  relieve  the  buying  Party of the  obligation  to pay the  entire  amount,
including the disputed portion, by the payment date. If such due date falls on a
Saturday,  Sunday,  or  holiday,  such due date shall be the next  working  day.
Payments  received  after the due date shall be  considered  late and shall bear
interest  on the  payment  due at a rate  equal to the  rate set out in  Section
35.19a(a)  of FERC's  Regulations,  as such  section may be amended from time to
time,  for the number of days elapsed from and  including  the day after the due
date, to and including the payment date.

c.       Upon the failure of the buying Party to pay all amounts due within
thirty days of the due date, the buying Party shall be in default.

Section 10.07     Right of Access; Right to Audit.

a.       Each Party,  after receiving reasonable notice from another Party, will
give  authorized  agents  and  employees  of the  other  the  right to enter its
premises at all reasonable  times for the purpose of reviewing  hourly  metering
and scheduling  records,  for reading or checking meters,  or for  constructing,
testing,  repairing,  renewing,  exchanging,  or  removing  any  or  all  of its
equipment  which may be located on the  property  of the other,  or for any work
incident to  performing  system  operations  under this  AGREEMENT  or rendering
service contracted for.

b.       Each Party shall have the right from time to time, upon written request
and at its own expense,  to audit the other  Party's books and records to verify
the information provided by that Party as required under this AGREEMENT.

Section 10.08     Drafting Responsibility.

         No Member shall be deemed  solely  responsible  for drafting all or any
portion of this AGREEMENT and, in the event of a dispute, responsibility for any
ambiguities arising from any provision of this AGREEMENT shall be equally shared
by the Members.

Section 10.09     Captions.

         All titles,  subject  headings,  section titles,  and similar items are
provided for the purpose of reference and convenience and are not intended to be
inclusive, definitive, or to affect the meaning of the contents or scope of this
AGREEMENT.

Section 10.10     Governing Law.

         This  AGREEMENT  shall be  interpreted  and governed by the laws of the
state of Minnesota, or the laws of the United States, as applicable.

Section 10.11     Regulation.

         This  AGREEMENT,  and all rights and  obligations  of MP  hereunder  is
subject to all applicable  state and federal laws and  regulations.  The Parties
agree to defend this AGREEMENT  before any regulatory  body, and to cooperate to
seek to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals. Fees or costs associated with
obtaining approvals shall be the responsibility of MP.

Section 10.12     No Joint Venture or Partnership.

         No provision of this  AGREEMENT  shall be  interpreted to mean or imply
that the Members have  established  or intend to establish a joint  venture or a
partnership.

Section 10.13     Amendment.

         Any amendment,  alteration,  variation,  modification, or waiver of the
provisions of this AGREEMENT shall be valid only after it has been signed by the
Parties  and, if  required,  approved or  accepted by any  regulatory  body with
jurisdiction over MP or this AGREEMENT.

Section 10.14     Severability.

         If any  governmental  agency or court of competent  jurisdiction  holds
that any provision of this AGREEMENT is invalid,  or if, as a result of a change
in any  federal  or  state  law or  constitutional  provision,  or any  rule  or
regulation  promulgated  pursuant  thereto,  any provision of this  AGREEMENT is
rendered  invalid or results in the  impossibility of performance  thereof,  the
remainder of this AGREEMENT shall not be affected  thereby and shall continue in
full force and effect. In such an event, the Parties shall promptly  renegotiate
in good faith new  provisions to restore this AGREEMENT as nearly as possible to
its original intent and effect.

Section 10.15     Superseding Effect.

         This  AGREEMENT  supersedes  and has merged  into it all prior oral and
written agreements on the same subjects by or among the Parties, with the effect
that this AGREEMENT shall control.

                                   SECTION 11.

                                   ARBITRATION

Section 11.01     Arbitration.

         Any  controversy  or claim arising out of or relating to this AGREEMENT
or the breach  hereof  which  cannot be  resolved  amicably  shall be settled by
arbitration.  A Party desiring to invoke this arbitration  provision shall serve
written notice upon the other of its intention to do so. The  arbitration  shall
be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration  then  prevailing.   The  American  Arbitration   Association  shall
administer the  arbitration  and act as appointing  authority of the arbitrator.
Each Party shall bear its own costs and

                                      -15-

expenses of the  arbitration,  including  attorneys and expert witness fees, and
shall  equally  share  the  expense  of the  arbitrator  and the  administrative
expenses of the  arbitration.  The  arbitration  shall be governed by the United
States  Arbitration  Act, 9 U.S.C.  Sections  1-16.  The award of the arbitrator
shall be final,  and  judgment on the award  rendered by the  arbitrator  may be
entered by any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitration shall be conducted in
Minneapolis, Minnesota unless the Parties agree otherwise.

Section 11.02     Effect of Termination on Arbitration.

         This  Section 11 shall  survive the  termination  of this  AGREEMENT as
necessary to resolve any outstanding  disputes that arose prior to the time that
termination of this AGREEMENT became effective as well as any disputes involving
termination, as provided for in Section 9.02 herein

Secretary
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First Street, N.E.
Washington, D.C. 20426

Re:      Amended Filing in Docket No. ER00-1857-000
         ------------------------------------------

Dear Mr. Boergers:

Enclosed  for  filing are six copies of the  response  of Split Rock  Energy LLC
("Split Rock") and Minnesota Power, Inc. ("MP"), to the deficiency letter issued
on April 10, 2000, in regards to the above-referenced  docket. Split Rock and MP
respectfully request that the Commission shorten the time for responding to this
filing, in an effort to permit Split Rock to become  operational by May 1, 2000,
the beginning of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool ("MAPP") summer season. There
have been no interventions to date in this proceeding.

I.       BACKGROUND

On  March  10,  2000,  Split  Rock  submitted  for  filing  an  Application  for
Market-Based  Rate  Authority   ("Market  Rate   Application"),   along  with  a
Market-Based Wholesale Power Sales Tariff ("Market Rate Tariff").  Split Rock is
a limited  liability  company formed pursuant to the laws of Minnesota by MP and
Great  River  Energy  ("GRE"),   a  generation  and   transmission   cooperative
(collectively Split Rock's "Members"). The Members formed Split Rock to schedule
and dispatch their combined generation  resources to optimally meet their native
load needs and obligations  under power sales contracts with third parties,  and
to market their excess generation resources.

In its Market Rate Application,  Split Rock requested authorization to engage in
wholesale   bulk  power  sales  at   market-determined   prices  and  to  resell
transmission  services.  Split  Rock  indicated  that it will sell  power to its
Members and will buy the excess power of its Members

                                                                  [MORGAN, LEWIS
Mr. David P. Boergers                                        & BOCKIUS LLP LOGO]

for resale,  at negotiated  rates under the proposed  Market Rate Tariff.  Split
Rock will also purchase power from third parties as necessary to optimally serve
the Members' native load needs and obligations under power sales contracts.

Split  Rock  explained  that  it  will  function  in  much  the  same  way  as a
cooperative,  in that  it  will  not  retain  net  revenues,  but  instead  will
periodically  disburse  any profits to the  Members.  Split  Rock's  Market Rate
Application  indicated that MP committed to treating  revenues  flowing  through
Split Rock,  the same as if the revenues were obtained  directly by MP. In other
words,  like a  cooperative,  Split  Rock is owned by  those  who use its  joint
dispatch and marketing  services - MP and GRE - and any profits flow back to its
owners, MP and GRE. Again, MP has committed to treating revenues from Split Rock
as if  they  were  earned  within  the  utility.  Due to the  "cooperative-like"
structure of Split Rock  vis-a-vis its Members,  there is no need for Split Rock
to commit not to transact  with its  affiliates  MP and GRE, nor is there a need
for a code of conduct to govern the interactions or relationships  between Split
Rock and its Members.

On April 10, 2000, Mr. Michael C.  McLaughlin,  Director,  Division of Corporate
Applications,  issued a deficiency  letter  regarding  Split Rock's  Market Rate
Application. The letter requested that Split Rock provide additional information
about  the  affiliate  relationships  noted  above.  Specifically,   the  letter
requested  that Split Rock explain why MP is a  cooperative,  and requested that
Split Rock respond to two scenarios specified in the letter.

II.      SPLIT ROCK'S AMENDED FILING

Split Rock and its  Members  have spent  considerable  time and effort to ensure
that captive customers will not be adversely affected by affiliate transactions.
As  explained  in further  detail  below,  Split Rock  retains no profits at its
level, but rather  regularly  distributes any profits to its Members MP and GRE.
MP has  expressly  committed to treat  revenues  from Split Rock as if they were
earned within MP, and as such,  there is no opportunity  for such revenues to be
diverted to MP's shareholders.  Ratepayers will benefit from the revenues in the
same manner as if such revenues were obtained directly by MP.

         A.       Transactions Between MP and Split Rock Will Not Adversely
                  ---------------------------------------------------------
                  Affect MP's Ratepayers
                  ----------------------

The  deficiency  letter first asks for a detailed  explanation as to why MP is a
cooperative  and how its customers  are the  cooperative's  owners,  and are not
captive  ratepayers.  MP is a traditional  investor-owned  utility,  and neither
Split Rock nor MP contends  that MP is a  cooperative.  Split Rock does  contend
that Split Rock itself, although not a cooperative, is

                                                                  [MORGAN, LEWIS
Mr. David P. Boergers                                        & BOCKIUS LLP LOGO]

structured like a cooperative,  and that this structure  eliminates any concerns
about affiliate abuse.

In the  traditional  case where a power marketer is seeking to transact with its
affiliated  public utility,  the Commission is concerned that the power marketer
and the  affiliated  utility  may  transact in ways that result in a transfer of
benefits from the  affiliated  utility (and its  ratepayers),  to the affiliated
power marketer (and its shareholders).  See, e.g., GS Electric Generating Corp.,
Inc., 81 FERC Paragraph 61,042 (1997). For example, the utility may purchase
power from its  affiliated  marketer  at  higher-than-market  rates,  or sell
power to its affiliated  power  marketer at  lower-than-market  rates - at the
expense of the utility's ratepayers - in exchange for other benefits which are
not passed on to the utility's  ratepayers. See, e.g., Hinson Power Co., 72 FERC
Paragraph 61,190,  at 61,911 (1995). In the case of cooperatives, however, this
concern is not present because the cooperative's owners are also its ratepayers;
thus, any profits or benefits  inuring to the  cooperative  are passed through
automatically  to the ratepayer/owners. See, e.g., Hinson, 72 FERC Paragraph
61,190, at 61,911.

Here,  Split Rock is  wholly-owned  by its sole Members MP and GRE, who are also
the  recipients  of Split Rock's joint  dispatch and power  marketing  services.
Split Rock is essentially a service entity for its Members.  Split Rock does not
have any "shareholders" separate and apart from these Members.

Although Split Rock will sell power to its Members, all sales by Split Rock to a
Member will be priced based on Split  Rock's cost,  and Split Rock will not earn
any  margins on power  sales to  Members.  Because  Split Rock will not earn any
margin  on sales of power to MP, no  revenues  of MP will be  diverted  to Split
Rock.  MP's ratepayers will thus be indifferent as to whether MP purchases power
from Split Rock, or directly from an unaffiliated third party.

Likewise,  although Split Rock will also purchase power from its Members, all of
Split  Rock's  purchases  from MP and GRE will be  priced  based  on a  transfer
pricing methodology agreed to and developed by the Members, which is intended to
track  market  prices.  Split Rock may sell power  purchased  from MP or GRE, to
third parties at a price that differs slightly from the price paid by Split Rock
to MP or GRE.  However,  Split Rock will not retain any profits earned from such
transactions.  Rather,  all  profits  obtained  by Split Rock will be  regularly
distributed to its Members, MP and GRE.

Accordingly,   Split  Rock  is  structured  like  a  cooperative,  in  that  its
Member-owners are also its customers,  and any profits earned by Split Rock will
be  regularly  disbursed  to its  Member-owners,  MP and GRE.  As noted,  MP has
expressly  committed  to treat  such  revenues  from  Split Rock as if they were
revenues earned by MP. MP's ratepayers will not be adversely

affected by Split Rock's  involvement in  transactions  with its Members.  Split
Rock is simply a joint  dispatch and power  marketing  organization,  created to
provide its  Members  with the  economic  benefits  of jointly  dispatching  and
marketing their combined resources.

         B.       Examples of Transactions
                  ------------------------

The letter  also  requests  that Split Rock  address  two  specific  examples of
transactions  and revenue flows.  Split Rock will address each of these examples
in turn.

         (1) Purchases by MP: "If MP purchases power at market-based  rates from
         Split Rock at a price that is above the prevailing market,  explain why
         this transaction will not adversely affect MP's captive ratepayers.  In
         your example,  trace the stream of revenues from MP to Split Rock, back
         to MP and its captive ratepayers."

The short answer is that MP's ratepayers and  shareholders  will be in precisely
the same  position  as if MP made the  purchase  from the market.  Split  Rock's
involvement in a purchase  transaction for one of its Members is similar to that
of a broker. Split Rock purchases power and resells it to the Member at the same
price paid by Split  Rock.  There is no mark-up  for such  purchases,  and Split
Rock's administrative and other non-power costs of the transaction are recovered
separately through its dispatch agreements with its Members. To the extent Split
Rock buys power at a price higher than a perceived  market price,  the result is
the same as if MP had made  such a  purchase  itself.  This  should  not  occur,
however,  as under the  pricing  methodology  established  by the  Members,  the
Members have the right to the lowest-cost energy purchased by Split Rock.

Accordingly,  Split Rock will not earn any margins from sales to MP. The results
will be the same as if MP had entered into a  transaction  directly with a third
party, leaving MP's ratepayers indifferent as to whether MP purchases power from
Split Rock, or directly from unaffiliated third parties.

         (2)  Purchases  by  Split  Rock:  "If  Split  Rock  purchases  power at
         market-based  rates  from MP at a price  that is below  the  prevailing
         market,  explain why this  transaction  will not adversely  affect MP's
         captive ratepayers.  In your example,  trace the stream of revenues and
         describe  the  impact  this  transaction  will  have  on  MP's  captive
         ratepayers."

The pricing  methodology  developed  by the Members for  purchases by Split Rock
from MP or GRE,  combines a regional  day-ahead  market  index with Split Rock's
actual market experience.

Accordingly,  the price paid by Split  Rock to MP for power may differ  from the
price  obtained by Split Rock upon  resale,  because  the market  price will not
reflect the market index factor upon which the price paid by Split Rock to MP is
based.

In the  event  that the  price  paid by Split  Rock to MP for power is below the
prevailing market price subsequently obtained by Split Rock, however, Split Rock
does not retain the difference.  Rather, as discussed above in Section II.A, any
Split Rock profit  will be  disbursed  to the  Members,  MP and GRE.  Although a
portion of Split Rock profits from sales of power  originally  purchased from MP
may go to GRE,  the sharing of profits will also work to MP's  benefit:  MP will
receive a similar  share of any Split Rock profits  obtained from sales of power
which Split Rock  originally  purchased  from GRE. As noted,  MP will treat such
disbursements  from Split Rock as if they were obtained  directly  through MP as
utility revenues.

         C.       Overall Benefits of Split Rock
                  ------------------------------

Although  the April 10, 2000  letter did not ask that MP or Split Rock  describe
the anticipated  benefits of Split Rock, Split Rock's activities are expected to
result in significant  savings to MP's ratepayers.  The economic dispatch of the
Members'  combined  generation  resources  will result in increased  operational
efficiencies.  Further,  Split Rock will  engage in  marketing  on behalf of its
Members,  with the goal of optimizing the value of their  resources.  Split Rock
will also engage in power trading  transactions with third parties,  and MP will
receive its  proportionate  share of Split Rock's profits from its power trading
activities. As noted, MP has committed to treat all revenues obtained from Split
Rock as utility  revenues.  Overall,  the Members  anticipate  that Split Rock's
economic  dispatch,  marketing,  and power  trading  activities  will  result in
significant cost savings and economic benefits to MP, and to MP's ratepayers.

III.     REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED NOTICE AND COMMENT PERIOD

As noted in the Market Rate Application, Split Rock and its Members desire Split
Rock to commence commercial operations on May 1, 2000, the beginning of the MAPP
summer season.  Accordingly,  Split Rock requested waiver of the standard 60-day
notice  requirement  to permit its Market Rate Tariff to become  effective  as a
rate schedule as of May 1, 2000. Such an effective date will allow Split Rock to
engage  in  transactions  under  the  Market  Rate  Tariff  as soon as it begins
operations, and to begin its joint dispatch and marketing functions on behalf of
the Members for the full upcoming MAPP summer season.

Split Rock  respectfully  requests that the Commission issue the attached notice
of amendment no later than April 24, 2000, and that the Commission  provide that
comments must be received

<F1>In May 2000 Minnesota Power sold its investment in ACE Limited (ACE) common
stock, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $30.4 million, or $0.44 per
share. The ACE shares were received in December 1999 upon completion of ACE's
merger with Capital Re Corporation (Capital Re). During 1999 Minnesota Power
recorded an aggregate $36.2 million, or $0.52 per share after-tax non-cash
charge in connection with the valuation and exchange of its investment in
Capital Re stock for the ACE shares, including a $24.1 million, or $0.35 per
share charge in the second quarter.
