Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be
read in  conjunction  with the  Company's  1995 Form 10-K. In the opinion of the
Company,  all adjustments  necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
interim  periods have been  included.  The results of operations  for an interim
period  may not give a true  indication  of  results  for the year.  The  income
statement  information  for prior periods has been  reclassified  to reflect the
discontinuance of the paper and pulp business.  Financial statement  information
may not be  comparable  between  periods due to the purchase of ADESA on July 1,
1995.

Note 3. Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. Under
the terms of the contract which extends  through 2007, the Company is purchasing
71 percent of the output from a generating  plant which is capable of generating
up to 470 MW.  Reductions  to about 49 percent of the output are provided for in
the contract and, at the option of Square  Butte,  could begin after a five-year
advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power  and  energy is a  proportionate  share of Square  Butte's
fixed obligations and variable  operating costs,  based on the percentage of the
total  output  purchased by the Company.  The annual  fixed  obligations  of the
Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1996 through  2000.  The variable
operating costs are not incurred unless  production  takes place. The Company is
responsible  for paying all costs and  expenses  of Square  Butte if not paid by
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company are
absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered to the
Company.

In March 1995 based on the  results of a project  which  analyzed  the  economic
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board
of directors of Lehigh  directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's
assets in a manner that would  maximize  utilization  of tax benefits.  Based on
this directive,  Lehigh  recognized $18.4 million of income in the first quarter
of 1995 by reducing the valuation  reserve  which  offsets  deferred tax assets.
Additional  unrealized  net  deferred  tax assets  resulting  from the  original
purchase of Lehigh of $8.2 million are included on the Company's  balance sheet.
These  assets are fully offset by the  deferred  tax asset  valuation  allowance
because under Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 109, "Accounting
for Income  Taxes," it is  currently  "more  likely  than not" that the value of
these assets will not be realized. Management reviews the appropriateness of the
valuation allowance quarterly.

The Company is still committed to a maximum  guaranty of $95 million to ensure a
portion of a $33.4  million  annual lease  obligation  for paper mill  equipment
under an operating lease extending to 2012. The purchaser of the Company's paper

Company  may make as a  result  of the  Company's  obligation  relating  to this
operating lease.




Note 6.   Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of MP&L Capital I

MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company  for the purpose of issuing  common and  preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  On March 20, 1996 the Trust  publicly  issued three  million 8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial  interests in the assets held by the Trust,  indirectly  resulting in
net proceeds to the Company of $72.6 million.  Holders of the QUIPS are entitled
to receive  quarterly  distributions  at an annual  rate of 8.05  percent of the
liquidation  preference  value of $25 per security.  The Company is the owner of
all the common trust securities, which constitute approximately 3 percent of the
aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust Securities. The sole asset of the
Trust is $77.5  million  of 8.05%  Junior  Subordinated  Debentures,  Series  A,
Due 2015 (Subordinated Debentures) issued by the Company, interest on which is
deductible by the Company for income tax  purposes.  The Trust will use interest
payments received on the  Subordinated  Debentures  it holds to make the 
quarterly  cash distributions on the QUIPS.

The QUIPS are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated
Debentures  at  maturity or upon  redemption.  The Company has the option at any
time on or after March 20, 2001, to redeem the Subordinated Debentures, in whole
or in part.  The Company  also has the option,  upon the  occurrence  of certain
events, (i) to redeem at any time the Subordinated Debentures,  in whole but not
in part, which would result in the redemption of all the Trust Securities,  or
(ii) to  terminate  the  Trust  and  cause  the  pro  rata  distribution  of the
Subordinated Debentures to the holders of the Trust Securities.

In addition to the Company's obligations under the Subordinated Debentures,  the
Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, payment of distributions on the
Trust  Securities,  to the  extent the Trust has funds  available  to pay such
distributions,  and has  agreed to pay all of the  expenses  of the Trust  (such
additional  obligations  collectively,  the  Back-up  Undertakings).  Considered
together, the Back-up Undertakings constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
by the Company of the Trust's obligations under the QUIPS.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
           Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota  Power  has  operations  in  four  business  segments:   (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
operations,   which  include  water  and  wastewater  services;  (3)  automobile
auctions,  which also include a finance  company and an auto transport  company;
and (4)  investments,  which  include real estate  operations  in Florida,  a 21
percent equity investment in a financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and a
securities portfolio.

Earnings per share of common stock for the quarter  ended March 31, 1996 were 61
cents  compared  to 87 cents for the  quarter  ended  March 31,  1995.  All four
business  segments were  profitable  for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996.
Increased  electric  sales, a gain in water  operations and  improvement in real
estate  operations,  excluding  the  recognition  of tax benefits in 1995,  were
contributing factors to 1996 earnings.

Higher earnings in 1995 were attributed to the 52 cent per share  recognition of
tax  benefits  associated  with real  estate  operations.  Earnings in 1995 also
reflect an 18 cent per share provision associated with exiting the truck-mounted
lifting equipment business.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Quarter Ended March 31, 1996 and 1995.

Electric operations.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations were
higher  in  1996  compared  to  1995  due  to a 14  percent  increase  in  total
kilowatt-hours  sales.  The  increase in sales is  attributed  primarily  to the
Company's  ability to market  energy to other power  suppliers.  Extreme  winter
weather in 1996 compared to the milder winter in 1995 also increased sales.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 31 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1996  compared  to 36 percent in 1995.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 11 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1996 and 13 percent in 1995. Sales to other power
suppliers accounted for 5 percent of electric operating revenue in 1996 compared
to only 1 percent in 1995.

Water operations. Operating revenue and income from water operations were higher
in 1996 due to the $1.1 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Seabrook's  assets
in South Carolina,  the addition of 17,000 new water and wastewater customers as
a result of the December 1995 purchase of the assets of Orange Osceola Utilities
in Florida,  and SSU's  implementation  of a $7.9 million  interim rate increase
effective January 23, 1996.

                                        -8-
<PAGE>
Automobile  Auctions.  Automobile  auction  operations were  profitable  despite
severe winter  weather on the east coast which limited  auction sales in January
1996. New auctions began  operations at  Jacksonville,  Florida and Newark,  New
Jersey during the first quarter of 1996.

Consolidated  operating  expenses  in 1996 are  significantly  higher due to the
inclusion of ADESA's  operations  following  its purchase by the Company in July
1995.

Investments.
   - Securities  Portfolio and Reinsurance.  The Company's securities portfolio
     and  reinsurance  performed  well in  1996.  The  portfolio  produced  less
     earnings in 1996 because its balance was smaller as a result of the sale of
     a portion of the portfolio to fund the purchase of ADESA.

   - Real Estate  Operations.  Revenue in 1996  includes  $3.7 million from the
     sale of Lehigh's  joint venture in a resort and golf course.  In 1995 $18.4
     million of tax benefits were recognized by Lehigh. The Company's portion of
     the tax benefits reflected as net income was $14.7 million, or 52 cents per
     share.

Corporate  Charges and Other. In March 1995 the Company  recorded a $5 million 
provision,  lowering earnings per share by 18 cents, in anticipation of exiting 
the truck-mounted lifting equipment business.

Discontinued  Operations.  Income from discontinued operations in 1995 reflects 
the operating results of the paper and pulp business which was sold in June 
1995.


Liquidity and Financial Position

Reference  is made to the  Consolidated  Statement  of Cash  Flows for the three
months ended March 31, 1996 and 1995, for purposes of the following  discussion.
Automobile auction operations, which were acquired in July 1, 1995, are included
in the three months ended March 31, 1996.

Cash flow activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and approximately 500,000 original issue shares of common stock are
available for issuance through the DRIP.

MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company  for the purpose of issuing  common and  preferred  securities.
On March 20, 1996 the Trust  publicly  issued three  million 8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial  interests in the assets held by the Trust,  indirectly  resulting in
net  proceeds to the Company of $72.6  million.  The net proceeds to the Company
were used to retire approximately $56  million  of  commercial  paper and 
approximately  $17 million will be used to redeem all of the  outstanding 
shares of the  Company's Serial Preferred Stock, $7.36 Series, on May 13, 1996.

Capital  requirements.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the three months
ended March 31, 1996 totaled $29.3  million.  These  expenditures  include $11.2
million for electric  operations,  $3.6 million for water  operations  and $14.5
million for automobile auction operations.  Internally  generated funds were the
primary source for funding these expenditures.

Item 5.    Other Information

Reference is made to the Company's 1995 Form 10-K for background  information on
the following updates.  Unless otherwise indicated,  cited references are to the
Company's 1995 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 9. - Second Full Paragraph and Page 13 - Fourth Full Paragraph

On May 1, 1996 the FERC  issued an Order on  Rehearing  for the St.  Louis River
Project  (Project).  The FERC directed the Company to negotiate with the Fond du
Lac Band of Lake  Superior  Chippewa a reasonable  annual  charge for the use of
tribal  lands  within  the  Project.  With  respect to the  Company's  arguments
regarding  the  generating  capacity  that will be lost as a result  of  certain
license  terms  and  conditions  mandated  by the FERC to  mitigate  environment
consequences  of the Project,  the FERC  determined that not enough evidence was
provided to alter the FERC's original analysis of the anticipated impact of such
mandates on the generating capacity.  The FERC extended the license term from 30
to 40 years  because of the  anticipated  impact of such  mandates.  The Company
estimates that the revenue from this Project will be reduced by approximately $1
million on an annual basis as a result of the license terms.

Ref. Page 9. - Last Paragraph

On March  29,  1996 the  Public  Service  Commission  of  Wisconsin  approved  a
$451,000,  or 1.1 percent,  increase in rates,  with an 11.6  percent  return on
equity for the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Superior Water, Light and Power
Company. Final rates were effective March 30, 1996.

Ref. Page 10. - Fourth Paragraph

On April 24, 1996 the FERC  issued two final  rules and a NOPR.  The first rule,
Order No. 888,  addresses both open access to  transmission  lines for wholesale
transactions and stranded cost issues.  The second rule, Order No. 889, requires
utilities to establish  electronic  systems to share information about available
transmission  capacity and establishes standards of conduct. The NOPR, "Capacity
Reservation  Open Access  Transmission  Tariffs,"  proposes  to  establish a new
system for  utilities  to use in  reserving  capacity  on their own and  others'
transmission  lines.  The new and  proposed  rules are  designed  to  facilitate
competition in the electric  industry,  lower prices and provide more choices to
energy customers.

In anticipation of the new rules, the Company filed an open access  transmission
tariff for wholesale  service on April 16, 1996 with the FERC.  This filing will
allow the Company to have a current  cost-based tariff in place for any new open
access  transmission  customers  requesting service on Minnesota Power's system.
The tariff is  expected to be  effective  60 days after the filing date with the
revenue subject to refund pending final approval of the rates.

                  relating to the registration of the Preferred Securities under
                  Section  12(b) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934,  as
                  amended ("Exchange Act"), including any amendments thereto;

                         (v) to execute  and  deliver on behalf of the Trust the
                  Underwriting  Agreement  and such other  agreements  as may be
                  necessary  or desirable in  connection  with the  consummation
                  thereof;

                        (vi) to select the  investment  banker or bankers to act
                  as  underwriters  with  respect  to the  offer and sale by the
                  Trust of Preferred  Securities  ("Offer")  and  negotiate  the
                  terms  of an  Underwriting  Agreement  and  pricing  agreement
                  providing for the Offer; and

                       (vii)  to take any other actions necessary or desirable
                  to carry out any of the foregoing activities.

                  (d)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to the  contrary,  the
Administrative  Trustees are  authorized  and directed to conduct the affairs of
the Trust and to operate the Trust so that the Trust will not be deemed to be an
"investment  company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended,  or classified  other than as a "grantor  trust" for United
States  federal  income  tax  purposes  and not as an  association  

                                      -15-

taxable  as a  corporation  and so  that  the  Debentures  will  be  treated  as
indebtedness of the Depositor for United States federal income tax purposes.  In
this  connection,  subject to the provisions of Section 10.03, the Depositor and
the Administrative  Trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent
with  applicable law, the certificate of trust filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware  with respect to the Trust (as amended or restated from
time to time, the "Certificate of Trust") or this Trust Agreement,  that each of
the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees determines in its discretion to be
necessary  or  desirable  for such  purposes,  as long as such  action  does not
materially  adversely  affect the  interests  of the  Holders  of the  Preferred
Securities.

                 Section 2.08. Assets of Trust. The assets of the Trust shall 
consist of the Trust Property.

                 Section 2.09.  Title  to Trust  Property. Legal title to all 
Trust Property shall be vested at all times in the Property Trustee (in its 
capacity as such) and shall be held and administered by the Property Trustee for
the benefit of the  Securityholders  in accordance with this Trust Agreement.

                  Section 3.01.  Payment Account.

                  (a) On or prior to the  Closing  Date,  the  Property  Trustee
shall establish the Payment Account.  The Property Trustees and the Paying Agent
appointed by the  Administrative  Trustees shall have exclusive control and sole
right of  withdrawal  with  respect to the  Payment  Account  for the purpose of
making deposits in and  withdrawals  from the Payment Account in accordance with
this Trust Agreement.  All monies and other property deposited or held from time
to time in the  Payment  Account  shall be held by the  Property  Trustee in the
Payment Account for the exclusive benefit of the Holders of Trust Securities and
for distribution as herein provided,  including (and subject to) any priority of
payments provided for herein.

                  (b) The Property Trustee shall deposit in the Payment Account,
promptly upon  receipt,  all payments of principal or interest on, and any other
payments  or  proceeds  with  respect to, the  Debentures.  Amounts  held in the
Payment  Account  shall  not  be  invested  by  the  Property   Trustee  pending
distribution thereof.

                            Distributions; Redemption

                  Section 4.01.  Distributions.

                  (a) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative,
and will  accumulate  whether or not there are funds of the Trust  available for
the payment of Distributions.  Distributions shall accrue from the Closing Date,
and,  except in the event that the  Depositor  exercises its right to extend the
interest  payment  period for the  Debentures  pursuant  to  Section  311 of the
Subordinated Indenture,  shall be payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June
30, September 30 and December 31 of each year,  commencing on March 31, 1996. If
any date on which Distributions are otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is
not a Business Day, then the payment of such  Distribution  shall be made on the
next  succeeding  day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other
payment in respect of any such delay)  except that,  if such  Business Day is in
the next succeeding calendar year, payment of such distribution shall be made on
the  immediately  preceding  Business Day, in each case, with the same force and
effect as if made on such date (each date on which  distributions are payable in
accordance with this Section 4.01(a) a "Distribution Date").

                  (b)  Distributions  payable on the Trust  Securities  shall be
fixed at a rate of  8.05%  per  annum of the  Liquidation  Amount  of the  Trust
Securities.  The amount of  Distributions  payable for any full quarterly period
shall be computed on the basis of twelve  30-day  months and a 360-day  year and
for any period  shorter than a full month,  on the basis of the actual number of
days  elapsed.  If the interest  payment  period for the  Debentures is extended
pursuant to Section 311 of the Subordinated Indenture, then Distributions on the
Preferred  Securities  will be deferred for the period equal to the extension of
the interest  payment  period for the Debentures and the rate per annum at which
Distributions on the Trust Securities accumulate shall be increased by an amount
such that the aggregate  amount of  Distributions  that  accumulate on all Trust
Securities  during any such  extended  interest  payment  period is equal to the
aggregate  amount  of  interest  (including,  to the  extent  permitted  by law,
interest  payable on unpaid  interest at the percentage rate per annum set forth
above,  compounded  quarterly)  that accrues  during any such extended  interest
payment period on the Debentures.  The amount of  Distributions  payable for any
period shall include the Additional Amounts, if any.

                  (c)  Distributions  on the Trust  Securities shall be made and
shall be deemed  payable on each  Distribution  Date only to the extent that the
Trust has  funds  available  in the  Payment  Account  for the  payment  of such
Distributions.

                  (d)  Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a
Distribution  Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the
Securities  Register for the Trust 

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

Securities  on the  relevant  record  date,  which shall be 15 days prior to the
relevant Distribution Date.

                  Section 4.02.  Redemption.

                  (a) On each Debenture Redemption Date and at the maturity date
for the  Debentures  (as defined in the  Subordinated  Indenture),  the Property
Trustee  will be  required to redeem a Like  Amount of Trust  Securities  at the
Redemption Price plus  accumulated and unpaid  Distributions to the date of such
payment.

                  (b)  Notice  of  redemption  shall be  given  by the  Property
Trustee by first-class mail,  postage prepaid,  mailed not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust  Securities to
be redeemed,  at such Holder's address appearing in the Security  Register.  All
notices of redemption or liquidation shall state:

                         (i)  the Redemption Date;

                        (ii)  the Redemption Price and the amount of accumulated
                  and unpaid Dividends to be paid on the Redemption Date;

                       (iii)  the CUSIP number;

                        (iv) if less than all the Outstanding  Trust  Securities
                  are  to  be  redeemed,   the   identification  and  the  total
                  Liquidation  Amount of the particular  Trust  Securities to be
                  redeemed; and

                         (v) that on the Redemption  Date the  Redemption  Price
                  plus accumulated and unpaid  Distributions to the date of such
                  payment  will  become  due and  payable  upon each such  Trust
                  Security to be redeemed and that  interest  thereon will cease
                  to accrue on and after said date.

                  (c) The Trust  Securities  redeemed  on each  Redemption  Date
shall  be  redeemed  at  the  Redemption   Price  plus  accumulated  and  unpaid
Distributions   to  the  date  of  such  payment  with  the  proceeds  from  the
contemporaneous  redemption of Debentures.  Redemptions of the Trust  Securities
shall be made and the Redemption Price plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions
to the date of such payment shall be deemed payable on each Redemption Date only
to the extent  that the Trust has funds  immediately  available  in the  Payment
Account for such payment.

                  (d) If the Property  Trustee  gives a notice of  redemption in
respect of any Preferred Securities,  then, by 12:00 noon, New York time, on the
Redemption  Date,  subject  to  Section  4.02(c),  the  Property  Trustee  shall
irrevocably  deposit with the Paying  Agent (or  Securities  Depository,  in the
event the Preferred  Securities are book-entry only) funds 

                                      -18-
<PAGE>
sufficient to pay the applicable  Redemption  Price plus  accumulated and unpaid
Distributions  to the date of such  payment  and  will  give  the  Paying  Agent
irrevocable  instructions  and  authority  to  pay  the  Redemption  Price  plus
accumulated and unpaid  Distributions to the date of such payment to the Holders
thereof   upon   surrender   of   their   Preferred   Securities   Certificates.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Distributions  payable  on  or  prior  to  the
redemption date for any Trust Securities  called for redemption shall be payable
to the  Holders  of such  Trust  Securities  as they  appear  on the  Securities
Register for the Trust  Securities on the relevant  record dates for the related
Distribution  Dates.  If notice of  redemption  shall  have been given and funds
deposited   as  required,   then  on  the   Redemption   Date,   all  rights  of
Securityholders  holding Trust  Securities so called for redemption  will cease,
except the right of such  Securityholders  to receive the Redemption  Price plus
accumulated and unpaid  Distributions  to the date of such payment,  but without
interest thereon, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the
event  that any  Redemption  Date is not a  Business  Day,  then  payment of the
Redemption Price payable on such date plus accumulated and unpaid  Distributions
to such date shall be made on the next  succeeding  day which is a Business  Day
(and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). In the
event  that  payment  of  the  Redemption  Price  plus  accumulated  and  unpaid
Distributions  in  respect of any Trust  Securities  called  for  redemption  is
improperly  withheld  or  refused  and not paid  either  by the  Trust or by the
Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will
continue  to accrue,  at the then  applicable  rate,  from the  Redemption  Date
originally  established by the Trust for such Trust  Securities to the date such
Redemption Price plus accumulated and unpaid  Distributions is actually paid, in
which case the actual  payment date will be deemed the date fixed for redemption
for purposes of calculating  the Redemption  Price plus  accumulated  and unpaid
Distributions to such date.

                  (e) Payment of the  Redemption  Price on the Trust  Securities
shall be made to the Holders  thereof as they appear on the Securities  Register
for the  Trust  Securities  on the  relevant  record  date,  which  shall be the
fifteenth day prior to the Redemption Date.

                  (f) If less than all the Outstanding  Trust  Securities are to
be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust
Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated 3% to the Common Securities and 97%
to the Preferred Securities.  The particular Preferred Securities to be redeemed
shall be  selected  not more than 60 days  prior to the  Redemption  Date by the
Property Trustee from the Outstanding Preferred Securities not previously called
for  redemption,  by such  method as the  Property  Trustee  shall deem fair and
appropriate and which may provide for the selection for a redemption of portions
(equal  to $25 or  integral  multiples  thereof)  of the  Liquidation  Amount of
Preferred  Securities of a  denomination  larger than $25. The Property  Trustee
shall  promptly  notify  the  Transfer  Agent and  Registrar  in  writing of the
Preferred  Securities  selected for redemption and, in the case of any Preferred
Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be
redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise
requires,  all  provisions  relating to the  redemption of Preferred  Securities
shall relate, in the case of any Preferred Securities redeemed or to be redeemed
only in part, to

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

the portion of the Liquidation Amount of Preferred  Securities which has been or
is to be redeemed.

                 Section 4.03.  Subordination of Common Securities.  (a) Payment
of  Distributions  (including  Additional  Amounts,  if applicable)  on, and the
Redemption  Price  plus  accumulated  and  unpaid  distributions  of,  the Trust
Securities,  as  applicable,  shall be made pro  rata  based on the  Liquidation
Amount of the Trust Securities;  provided,  however, that if on any Distribution
Date or Redemption  Date a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing,  no payment of any Distribution  (including  Additional  Amounts, if
applicable)  on, or  Redemption  Price of,  any  Common  Security,  and no other
payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common
Securities,  shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and
unpaid  Distributions  (including  Additional  Amounts,  if  applicable)  on all
Outstanding  Preferred Securities for all distribution periods terminating on or
prior  thereto,  or in  the  case  of  payment  of  the  Redemption  Price  plus
accumulated and unpaid  Distributions  the full amount of such Redemption  Price
plus  accumulated  and  unpaid   Distributions  on  all  Outstanding   Preferred
Securities,  shall have been made or  provided  for,  and all funds  immediately
available to the Property  Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full
in cash of all Distributions  (including  Additional Amounts, if applicable) on,
or Redemption  Price plus  accumulated and unpaid  Distributions  of,  Preferred
Securities then due and payable.

                  (b) In the case of the  occurrence  of any  Event  of  Default
resulting  from a Debenture  Event of Default,  the Holder of Common  Securities
will be deemed  to have  waived  any such  Event of  Default  under  this  Trust
Agreement  until the effect of all such  Events of Default  with  respect to the
Preferred Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated.  Until any
such Events of Default under this Trust  Agreement with respect to the Preferred
Securities  have been so cured,  waived or  otherwise  eliminated,  the Property
Trustee  shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the  Preferred  Securities
and not the  Holder  of the  Common  Securities,  and  only the  Holders  of the
Preferred  Securities will have the right to direct the Property  Trustee to act
on their behalf.

                 Section 4.04.  Payment  Procedures.  Payments in respect of the
Preferred  Securities shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Person
entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities  Register or, if
the Preferred Securities are held by a Securities Depository, such Distributions
shall be made to the  Securities  Depository,  which shall  credit the  relevant
Persons' accounts at such Securities  Depository on the applicable  distribution
dates. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner
as shall be mutually agreed between the  Administrative  Trustees and the Holder
of the Common Securities.

                 Section  4.05.  Tax Returns  and  Reports.  The  Administrative
Trustees shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Depositor's expense and
direction,  and  file  all  United  States  federal,  state  and  local  tax and
information  returns  and  reports  required to be filed by or in respect of the
Trust. In this regard,  the  Administrative  Trustees shall (a) 

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
prepare and file (or cause to be prepared or filed) the Internal Revenue Service
Form 1041 (or any successor  form)  required to be filed in respect of the Trust
in each  taxable  year of the Trust and (b)  prepare and furnish (or cause to be
prepared and  furnished) to each  Securityholder  the related  Internal  Revenue
Service  Form 1099,  or any  successor  form or the  information  required to be
provided on such form. The  Administrative  Trustees shall provide the Depositor
and the Property Trustee with a copy of all such returns,  reports and schedules
promptly after such filing or furnishing.  The Trustees shall comply with United
States  federal  withholding  and backup  withholding  tax laws and  information
reporting requirements with respect to any payments to Securityholders under the
Trust Securities.

                 Section 4.06.  Payments  under  Indenture.  Any amount  payable
hereunder to any Holder of Preferred  Securities  shall be reduced by the amount
of any  corresponding  payment  such Holder has  directly  received  pursuant to
Section  808 of  the  Subordinated  Indenture.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions
hereunder  to the  contrary,  Securityholders  acknowledge  that any  Holder  of
Preferred Securities that receives payment under Section 808 of the Subordinated
Indenture  may  receive  amounts  greater  than the  amount  such  Holder may be
entitled to receive pursuant to the other provisions of this Trust Agreement.

by the  contribution  by the  Depositor  pursuant to Section  2.03 and until the
issuance  of the  Trust  Securities,  and at any  time  during  which  no  Trust
Securities are outstanding,  the Depositor shall be the sole beneficial owner of
the Trust.

                 Section  5.02.  The Trust  Securities  Certificates.  The Trust
Securities  Certificates  shall be issued in  denominations  of $25  Liquidation
Amount and integral multiples  thereof.  Subject to Section 2.04 relating to the
original issuance of the Preferred Securities Certificate registered in the name
of  the  nominee  of  The  Depository   Trust  Company,   the  Trust  Securities
Certificates  shall be  executed  on behalf of the Trust by manual or  facsimile
signature of at least one  Administrative  Trustee and, if executed on behalf of
the Trust by  facsimile  signature,  countersigned  by a  Transfer  Agent or its

individuals who were, at the time when such signatures  shall have been affixed,
authorized  to sign on behalf of the Trust  and,  if  executed  on behalf of the
Trust by facsimile  signature,  countersigned  by a Transfer Agent or its agent,
shall be validly  issued and entitled to the  benefits of this Trust  Agreement,
notwithstanding  that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so
authorized  prior to the delivery of such Trust  Securities  Certificates or did
not  hold  such  offices  at the  date  of  delivery  of such  Trust  Securities
Certificates.  A transferee  of a Trust  Securities  Certificate  shall become a
Securityholder,  and  shall  be  entitled  to  the  rights  and  

                                      -21-

subject to the obligations of a Securityholder  hereunder, upon due registration
of such Trust  Securities  Certificate  in such  transferee's  name  pursuant to
Section 5.04 or 5.11.

                 Section  5.03.  Execution  and  Delivery  of  Trust  Securities
Certificates. On the Closing Date, the Administrative Trustees shall cause Trust
Securities  Certificates,  in an  aggregate  Liquidation  Amount as  provided in
Sections 2.04 and 2.05,  to be executed on behalf of the Trust,  and in the case
of Preferred  Securities  executed by facsimile  signature,  countersigned  by a
Transfer  Agent or its agent,  and delivered to or upon the written order of the
Depositor signed by its chairman of the board, any of its vice presidents or its
Treasurer,  without  further  corporate  action by the Depositor,  in authorized
denominations.  The Depositor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold each Transfer
Agent  harmless  against  any and all costs  and  liabilities  incurred  without
negligence arising out of or in connection with any such countersigning by it.

                 Section  5.04.   Registration   of  Transfer  and  Exchange  of
Preferred Securities Certificates. The Registrar shall keep or cause to be kept,
at its principal  corporate office, a Securities  Register in which,  subject to
such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Registrar shall provide for
the registration of Preferred Securities  Certificates and the Common Securities
Certificates  (subject  to  Section  5.10 in the case of the  Common  Securities
Certificates)   and   registration  of  transfers  and  exchanges  of  Preferred
Securities Certificates as herein provided.

                  Upon surrender for  registration  of transfer of any Preferred
Securities  Certificate at the office or agency  maintained  pursuant to Section
5.08, the Administrative  Trustees,  or any one of them, shall execute on behalf
of the Trust by manual or facsimile  signature and, if executed on behalf of the
Trust by facsimile signature, cause a Transfer Agent or its agent to countersign
and deliver,  in the name of the designated  transferee or  transferees,  one or
more new Preferred Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of a like
aggregate  Liquidation Amount. At the option of a Holder,  Preferred  Securities
Certificates  may be exchanged for other  Preferred  Securities  Certificates in
authorized  denominations of the same class and of a like aggregate  Liquidation
Amount upon surrender of the Preferred  Securities  Certificates to be exchanged
at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.08.

                  Every   Preferred   Securities    Certificate   presented   or
surrendered  for  registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a
written  instrument  of  transfer  in form  satisfactory  to the  Administrative
Trustees  and a Transfer  Agent  duly  executed  by the Holder or such  Holder's
attorney  duly  authorized in writing.  Each  Preferred  Securities  Certificate
surrendered  for  registration  of transfer or  exchange  shall be canceled  and
subsequently  disposed  of by the  Administrative  Trustees in  accordance  with
customary practice.  The Trust shall not be required to (i) issue,  register the
transfer of, or exchange any Preferred  Securities  during a period beginning at
the opening of  business 15 calendar  days before the day of mailing of a notice
of redemption of any Preferred  Securities  called for  redemption and ending at
the close of business on the day of such  mailing or (ii)  register the transfer
of 

                                      -22-

part,  except the  unredeemed  portion of any such  Preferred  Securities  being
redeemed in part.

                  No  service  charge  shall  be made  for any  registration  of
transfer or exchange of Preferred Securities Certificates,  but a Transfer Agent
may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental  charge
that may be imposed in  connection  with any  transfer or exchange of  Preferred
Securities Certificates.

                 Section  5.05.  Mutilated,  Destroyed,  Lost  or  Stolen  Trust
Securities Certificates. If (a) any mutilated Trust Securities Certificate shall
be  surrendered  to a Transfer  Agent,  or if a  Transfer  Agent  shall  receive
evidence  to its  satisfaction  of the  destruction,  loss or theft of any Trust
Securities  Certificate  and (b) there shall be delivered to the Transfer  Agent
and the Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by
them to save each of them and the  Depositor  harmless,  then in the  absence of
notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser,  the Administrative  Trustees,  or any one of them, on behalf of
the Trust,  shall execute by manual or facsimile  signature and, if execution on
behalf of the  Trust is by  facsimile  signature,  countersigned  by a  Transfer
Agent; and the Administrative Trustees, or any one of them, shall make available
for delivery, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,  destroyed, lost
or stolen Trust Securities  Certificate,  a new Trust Securities  Certificate of
like class,  tenor and denomination.  In connection with the issuance of any new
Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrative  Trustees or
the Transfer  Agent may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental  charge that may be imposed in connection  therewith.  Any
duplicate  Trust  Securities  Certificate  issued pursuant to this Section shall
constitute  conclusive  evidence of an  ownership  interest in the Trust,  as if
originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities
Certificate shall be found at any time.

                 Section  5.06.  Persons  Deemed  Securityholders.  Prior to due
presentation of a Trust Securities Certificate for registration of transfer, the
Trustees and the  Registrar  shall be entitled to treat the Person in whose name
any Trust Securities  Certificate shall be registered in the Securities Register
as the owner of such Trust  Securities  Certificate for the purpose of receiving
Distributions  and for all other purposes  whatsoever,  and neither the Trustees
nor the Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.

                 Section  5.07.  Access  to List of  Securityholders'  Names and
Addresses.  The  Administrative  Trustees shall furnish or cause to be furnished
(x) to the Depositor, within 15 days after receipt by any Administrative Trustee
of a request  therefor  from the  Depositor  in writing and (y) to the  Property
Trustee,  promptly  after  receipt  by any  Administrative  Trustee of a request
therefor  from the  Property  Trustee in writing in order to enable the Property
Trustee to discharge its obligations under this Trust Agreement, a list, in such
form as the Depositor or the Property  Trustee may  reasonably  require,  of the
names and addresses of the Securityholders as of the most recent record date. If
Holders of Trust Securities  Certificates  evidencing ownership at such time and
for the  previous  six  months  not 

                                      -23-

less than 25% of the outstanding  aggregate  Liquidation Amount apply in writing
to any Administrative  Trustee,  and such application states that the applicants
desire to communicate  with other  Securityholders  with respect to their rights
under this Trust Agreement or under the Trust  Securities  Certificates and such
application is accompanied by a copy of the  communication  that such applicants
propose  to  transmit,  then the  Administrative  Trustees  shall,  within  five
Business  Days after the receipt of such  application,  afford  such  applicants
access during normal business hours to the current list of Securityholders. Each
Holder, by receiving and holding a Trust Securities Certificate, shall be deemed
to have agreed not to hold either the Depositor or the  Administrative  Trustees
accountable by reason of the  disclosure of its name and address,  regardless of
the source from which such information was derived.

                 Section  5.08.  Maintenance  of Office or Agency.  The  Company
shall or shall cause the Transfer Agent to maintain in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Preferred
Securities  Certificates  may be  surrendered  for  registration  of transfer or
exchange  and where  notices and demands to or upon the Company or the  Transfer
Agent in respect of the Trust Securities Certificates may be served. The Company
initially  designates  The Bank of New  York at its  principal  corporate  trust
office for such purposes. The Company shall or shall cause the Transfer Agent to
give prompt  written notice to the  Depositor,  the Property  Trustee and to the
Securityholders of any change in any such office or agency.

                 Section 5.09.  Appointment  of Paying  Agent.  The Paying Agent
shall make distributions to  Securityholders  from the Payment Account and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Administrative  Trustees and the
Property  Trustee.  Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable  power to withdraw
funds from the  Payment  Account  for the  purpose  of making the  Distributions
referred  to  above.  The  Property  Trustee  shall be  entitled  to rely upon a
certificate of the Paying Agent stating in effect the amount of such funds so to
be withdrawn  and that same are to be applied by the Paying Agent in  accordance
with this  Section  5.09.  The  Administrative  Trustees  or any one of them may
revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if the  Administrative  Trustee or
any one of them  determines in its sole  discretion  that the Paying Agent shall
have  failed to  perform  its  obligations  under this  Trust  Agreement  in any
material  respect.  The  Paying  Agent may choose  any  co-paying  agent that is
acceptable to the  Administrative  Trustees and the Depositor.  The Paying Agent
shall be permitted to resign upon 30 days' written notice to the  Administrative
Trustees and the  Depositor.  In the event of the removal or  resignation of the
Paying Agent,  the  Administrative  Trustees  shall appoint a successor  that is
reasonably acceptable to the Property Trustee and the Depositor to act as Paying
Agent (which shall be a bank,  trust company or an Affiliate of the  Depositor).
The  Administrative  Trustees  shall cause such  successor  Paying  Agent or any
additional Paying Agent appointed by the Administrative  Trustees to execute and
deliver to the Trustees an  instrument in which such  successor  Paying Agent or
additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustees that as Paying Agent, such
successor  Paying Agent or  additional  Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any,
held by it for  payment to the  Securityholders  in trust for the benefit of the

                                      -24-
<PAGE>
Securityholders  entitled  thereto  until  such  sums  shall  be  paid  to  such
Securityholders.  The  Paying  Agent  shall  return all  unclaimed  funds to the
Property  Trustee and upon  resignation or removal of a Paying Agent such Paying
Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee. The
provisions  of  Sections  8.01,  8.03 and 8.06 shall  apply to the Paying  Agent
appointed  hereunder,  and the Paying  Agent shall be bound by the  requirements
with  respect  to  paying  agents of  securities  issued  pursuant  to the Trust
Indenture  Act. Any reference in this Trust  Agreement to the Paying Agent shall
include any co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise.

                 Section 5.10.  Ownership of Common Securities by Depositor.  On
the  Closing  Date and on each other date  provided  for in  Section  2.05,  the
Depositor shall acquire, and thereafter retain,  beneficial and record ownership
of the Common Securities.  Any attempted transfer of the Common Securities shall
be  void.  The  Administrative  Trustees  shall  cause  each  Common  Securities
Certificate   issued  to  the  Depositor  to  contain  a  legend  stating  "THIS
CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE".  Common Securities  Certificates  representing
the  Common  Securities  shall  be  issued  to the  Depositor  in the  form of a
typewritten or definitive Common Securities Certificate.

                 Section 5.11.  Definitive  Preferred  Securities  Certificates.
Upon initial  issuance of the  Preferred  Securities  the  Definitive  Preferred
Securities Certificates shall be typewritten,  printed, lithographed or engraved
or may be  produced  in any other  manner  as is  reasonably  acceptable  to the
Administrative   Trustees,   as  evidenced  by  the  execution  thereof  by  the
Administrative Trustees, or any one of them. The Administrative Trustees, or any
one of them,  shall  execute  on behalf  of the  Trust by  manual  or  facsimile
signature,  and, if executed by facsimile on behalf of the Trust,  countersigned
by  the  Transfer  Agent  or  its  agent  the  Definitive  Preferred  Securities
Certificates  initially in accordance  with the  instructions  of the Depositor.
Neither  the  Transfer  Agent nor any of the  Administrative  Trustees  shall be
liable for any delay in delivery of such  instructions and may conclusively rely
on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions.

                 Section 5.12.  Book-Entry System.  Some or all of the Preferred
Securities  may be  registered  in the name of the  Securities  Depository  or a
nominee therefor, and held in the custody of the Securities Depository.  In such
event,  a single  certificate  will be issued and  delivered  to the  Securities
Depository  for such  Preferred  Securities,  in which  case the  Owners of such
Preferred  Securities will not receive  physical  delivery of  certificates  for
Preferred  Securities.  Except as provided  herein,  all transfers of beneficial
ownership  interests in such  Preferred  Securities  will be made by  book-entry
only,  and  no  investor  or  other  party  purchasing,   selling  or  otherwise
transferring beneficial ownership of the Preferred Securities will receive, hold
or deliver any certificate for Preferred Securities. The Depositor, the Trustees
and the Paying Agent will recognize the Securities  Depository or its nominee as
the Holder of  Preferred  Securities  for all  purposes,  including  notices and
voting.

                  The Administrative  Trustees,  at the direction and expense of
the  Depositor,  may from time to time  appoint  a  Securities  Depository  or a
successor thereto and enter into a 

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

letter of representations or other agreement with such Securities  Depository to
establish  procedures with respect to the Preferred  Securities.  Any Securities
Depository shall be a Clearing Agency.

                  The Depositor and the Trustees  covenant and agree to meet the
requirements  of a  Securities  Depository  for the  Preferred  Securities  with
respect  to   required   notices   and  other   provisions   of  the  letter  of
representations or agreement executed with respect to such Preferred Securities.

                  Whenever the beneficial  ownership of any Preferred Securities
is determined through the books of a Securities Depository,  the requirements in
this Trust  Agreement of holding,  delivering  or  transferring  such  Preferred
Securities shall be deemed modified with respect to such Preferred Securities to
meet the  requirements  of the Securities  Depository with respect to actions of
the  Trustees,  the  Depositor  and the  Paying  Agent.  Any  provisions  hereof
permitting or requiring delivery of such Preferred  Securities shall, while such
Preferred Securities are in a book-entry system, be satisfied by the notation on
the books of the Securities Depository in accordance with applicable state law.

                 Section 5.13. Rights of Securityholders. The legal title to the
Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as
such) in accordance  with Section 2.09, and the  Securityholders  shall not have
any right or title  therein other than an undivided  beneficial  interest in the
assets of the Trust  conferred by their Trust  Securities and they shall have no
right to call for any  partition or division of  property,  profits or rights of
the Trust  except as described  below.  The Trust  Securities  shall be personal
property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust
Agreement.  The Preferred  Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights
and when issued and delivered to Securityholders against payment of the purchase
price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable interests in the Trust.


                                 ARTICLE VI.

                    Acts of Securityholders; Meetings; Voting

                 Section 6.01.  Limitations on Voting Rights.

                  (a) Except as provided in this Section  6.01, in Section 10.03
and as otherwise  required by law, no Holder of Preferred  Securities shall have
any  right  to vote  or in any  manner  otherwise  control  the  administration,
operation and management of the Trust or the  obligations of the parties hereto,
nor shall  anything  herein set forth,  or  contained  in the terms of the Trust
Securities  Certificates,  be construed so as to constitute the  Securityholders
from time to time as  partners  or members of an  association.  If the  Property
Trustee  fails  to  enforce  its  rights  under  the  Debentures  or this  Trust
Agreement,  a Holder of Preferred  Securities  may institute a legal  proceeding
directly  against the Depositor to enforce the 

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

Property  Trustee's rights under the Debentures or this Trust Agreement,  to the
fullest extent permitted by law, without first  instituting any legal proceeding
against the Property Trustee or any other person. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a Holder of  Preferred  Securities  may  directly  institute  a  proceeding  for
enforcement  of payment to such Holder  directly of  principal of or interest on
the  Debentures  having a principal  amount equal to the  aggregate  liquidation
preference amount of the Preferred Securities of such Holder on or after the due
dates specified in the Debentures.

                  (b) So  long  as  any  Debentures  are  held  by the  Property
Trustee,  the  Trustees  shall  not (i)  direct  the time,  method  and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee,  or
executing any trust or power conferred on the Debenture  Trustee with respect to
such Debentures, (ii) waive any past default which is waivable under Section 813
of the  Subordinated  Indenture,  (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a
declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable or
(iv) consent to any amendment,  modification or termination of the  Subordinated
Indenture or the Debentures,  where such consent shall be required,  without, in
each case,  obtaining  the prior  approval of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% of
the  aggregate  Liquidation  Amount  of the  Outstanding  Preferred  Securities;
provided,  however, that where a consent under the Subordinated  Indenture would
require the  consent of each  holder of  Debentures  affected  thereby,  no such
consent shall be given by any Trustee  without the prior written consent of each
holder of  Preferred  Securities.  The  Trustees  shall not  revoke  any  action
previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Preferred Securities,  except
pursuant to a subsequent vote of the Preferred Securities.  The Property Trustee
shall notify all Holders of the  Preferred  Securities  of any notice of default
received from the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures.  In addition
to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Preferred Securities,
prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Property Trustee shall, at the
expense of the  Depositor,  obtain an Opinion  of  Counsel  experienced  in such
matters to the effect that the Trust will be classified as a "grantor trust" and
not as an association  taxable as a corporation for United States federal income
tax purposes on account of such action.

                  (c) If any proposed  amendment to the Trust Agreement provides
for,  or the  Trustees  otherwise  propose to effect,  (i) any action that would
materially  adversely  affect the powers,  preferences  or special rights of the
Preferred  Securities,  whether by way of  amendment  to the Trust  Agreement or
otherwise,  or (ii) the  dissolution,  winding-up or  termination  of the Trust,
other than  pursuant to the terms of this Trust  Agreement,  then the Holders of
Outstanding  Preferred  Securities  as a class will be  entitled to vote on such
amendment  or proposal  and such  amendment  or proposal  shall not be effective
except with the approval of the Holders of at least 66 2/3 in Liquidation Amount
of the Outstanding  Preferred  Securities.  No amendment to this Trust Agreement
may be made if, as a result of such amendment, the Trust would not be classified
as a "grantor  trust" but as an association  taxable as a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes.

                 Section 6.02. Notice of Meetings. Notice of all meetings of the
Holders of  Preferred  Securities,  stating  the time,  place and purpose of the
meeting, shall be given by the Administrative Trustees pursuant to Section 10.08
to each Holder of a Preferred  Security,  at his registered address, at least 15
days and not more than 90 days  before the  meeting.  At any such  meeting,  any
business properly before the meeting may be so considered  whether or not stated
in the notice of the  meeting.  Any  adjourned  meeting may be held as adjourned
without further notice.

                 Section 6.03. Meetings of Holders of Preferred  Securities.  No
annual meeting of  Securityholders  is required to be held.  The  Administrative
Trustees, however, shall call a meeting of Securityholders to vote on any matter
upon the written request of the Holders of 25% of the then Outstanding Preferred
Securities (based upon their aggregate  Liquidation Amount) and may, at any time
in their discretion,  call a meeting of Holders of Preferred  Securities to vote
on any matters as to which the Holders of Preferred  Securities  are entitled to
vote.

                  Holders of 50% of the then  Outstanding  Preferred  Securities
(based upon their aggregate Liquidation Amount),  present in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Securityholders.

                  If a quorum is present at a meeting,  an  affirmative  vote by
the Holders of Preferred Securities present, in person or by proxy, holding more
than the  lesser  of (x) 66 2/3% of the then  Outstanding  Preferred  Securities
(based  upon their  aggregate  Liquidation  Amount)  held by the Holders of then
Outstanding Preferred Securities present,  either in person or by proxy, at such
meeting and (y) 50% of the Outstanding  Preferred  Securities  (based upon their
aggregate   Liquidation   Amount)   shall   constitute   the   action   of   the
Securityholders,  unless  this  Trust  Agreement  requires  a greater  number of
affirmative votes.

                 Section 6.04. Voting Rights.  Securityholders shall be entitled
to one vote  for  each $25 of  Liquidation  Amount  represented  by their  Trust
Securities  in  respect  of any  matter  as to which  such  Securityholders  are
entitled to vote.

                 Section 6.05. Proxies,  etc. At any meeting of Securityholders,
any Securityholder  entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no
proxy  shall be voted at any  meeting  unless it shall have been  placed on file
with the  Administrative  Trustees,  or with such other  officer or agent of the
Trust as the  Administrative  Trustees may direct, for verification prior to the
time at which such vote shall be taken. Only  Securityholders of record shall be
entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any
one of them may vote at any  meeting  in person or by proxy in  respect  of such
Trust Securities,  but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting
in  person or by proxy,  and such  joint  owners  or their  proxies  so  present
disagree  as to any vote to be cast,  such vote shall not be received in respect
of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a
Securityholder  shall  be  deemed  valid  unless  

                                      -28-
<PAGE>
challenged  at or prior to its  exercise,  or, if earlier,  until eleven  months
after  it is  sent  and the  burden  of  proving  invalidity  shall  rest on the
challenger.

                 Section 6.06.  Securityholder  Action by Written  Consent.  Any
action which may be taken by Securityholders at a meeting may be taken without a
meeting if Securityholders holding more than a majority of all Outstanding Trust
Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion
thereof as shall be required by any express  provision of this Trust  Agreement)
shall consent to the action in writing (based upon their  aggregate  Liquidation
Amount).

                 Section 6.07.  Record Date for Voting and Other  Purposes.  For
the purposes of determining  the  Securityholders  who are entitled to notice of
and to vote at any  meeting  or by written  consent,  or to  participate  in any
Distribution  on the Trust  Securities  in respect of which a record date is not
otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement,  or for the purpose of any other
action, the  Administrative  Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more
than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of  Securityholders or the payment
of  Distribution  or other action,  as the case may be, as a record date for the
determination  of the  identity  of  the  Securityholders  of  record  for  such
purposes.

                 Section 6.08.  Acts of  Securityholders.  Any request,  demand,
authorization,  direction,  notice,  consent, waiver or other action provided or
permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by  Securityholders
may be embodied in and  evidenced by one or more  instruments  of  substantially
similar  tenor  signed by such  Securityholders  in  person or by an agent  duly
appointed in writing;  and, except as otherwise  expressly provided herein, such
action shall become  effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered
to the Administrative  Trustees.  Such instrument or instruments (and the action
embodied therein and evidenced  thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the
"Act" of the  Securityholders  signing such instrument or instruments.  Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall
be  sufficient  for any purpose of this Trust  Agreement and (subject to Section
8.01)  conclusive  in favor of the Trustees,  if made in the manner  provided in
this Section.

                  The fact and date of the  execution  by any Person of any such
instrument  or  writing  may be proved  by the  affidavit  of a witness  of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer  authorized by
law to take  acknowledgements  of deeds,  certifying that the individual signing
such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such
execution  is by a  signer  acting  in a  capacity  other  than  his  individual
capacity,  such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute  sufficient proof
of his authority.  The fact and date of the execution of any such  instrument or
writing,  or the authority of the Person  executing the same, may also be proved
in any other manner which any Trustee deems sufficient.

                  The ownership of Preferred  Securities  shall be proved by the
Securities Register.

                                      -29-
<PAGE>
                  Any  request,  demand,   authorization,   direction,   notice,
consent,  waiver or other Act of the  Securityholder of any Trust Security shall
bind  every  future   Securityholder   of  the  same  Trust   Security  and  the
Securityholder  of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer
thereof or in exchange  therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done,
omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustees or the Trust in reliance thereon,
whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.

                  Without  limiting the  foregoing,  a  Securityholder  entitled
hereunder  to take any action  hereunder  with  regard to any  particular  Trust
Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the  Liquidation  Amount of
such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do
so  pursuant  to  such  appointment  with  regard  to all or any  part  of  such
Liquidation Amount.

                  If  any   dispute   shall   arise   between   or   among   the
Securityholders   and  the   Administrative   Trustees   with   respect  to  the
authenticity,  validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization,
direction,  consent, waiver or other Act of such Securityholder or Trustee under
this Article VI, then the  determination  of such matter by the Property Trustee
shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.

                 Section 6.09.  Inspection  of Records.  Subject to Section 5.07
concerning access to the list of Securityholders,  upon reasonable notice to the
Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee, the other records of the Trust
shall be open to inspection by Securityholders  during normal business hours for
any  purpose  reasonably  related  to  such   Securityholder's   interest  as  a
Securityholder.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                                  The Trustees

                 Section 8.01.  Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

                  (a) The duties and  responsibilities  of the Trustees shall be
as provided by this Trust  Agreement  and, in the case of the Property  Trustee,
the Trust Indenture Act, and no implied  covenants or obligations  shall be read
into this Trust  Agreement  against  any of the  Trustees.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  no  provision  of this  Trust  Agreement  shall  require  any of the
Trustees  to  expend  or risk its own funds or  otherwise  incur  any  financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder,  or in the exercise
of any of its  rights  or  powers,  if it  shall  have  reasonable  grounds  for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate  indemnity  against such risk
or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Trust Agreement to the contrary,  the duties and responsibilities of the
Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement shall be subject to the protections,
exculpations and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under
the provisions of the Trust  Indenture Act and, to the extent  applicable,  Rule
3A-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or any successor rule
thereunder.  Whether or not therein  expressly so provided,  every  provision of
this Trust  Agreement  relating to the conduct or affecting  the liability of or
affording  protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section.

                  (b) All  payments  made by the  Property  Trustee  or a Paying
Agent in respect of the Trust  Securities shall be made only from the income and
proceeds  from the Trust  Property  and only to the extent  that there  shall be
sufficient  income or proceeds  from the Trust  Property to enable the  Property
Trustee or Paying Agent to make  payments in  accordance  with the terms hereof.
Each Securityholder,  by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will
look  solely to the income and  proceeds  from the Trust  Property to the extent
available for  distribution  to it as herein  provided and that the Trustees are
not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust
Security  or for any other  liability  in  respect of any Trust  Security.  This
Section 8.01(b) does not limit the liability of the Trustees expressly set forth
elsewhere in this Trust  Agreement or, in the case of the Property  Trustee,  in
the Trust Indenture Act.

                  (c) All duties and  responsibilities  of the Property  Trustee
contained in this Trust Agreement are subject to the following:

                         (i) the  Property  Trustee's  sole duty with respect to
                  the custody,  safe keeping and  physical  preservation  of the
                  Trust  Property  shall  be to deal  with  such  property  in a
                  similar  manner as the  Property  Trustee  deals with  similar
                  property for its own account,  subject to the  protections and
                  limitations  on  liability  afforded to the  Property  Trustee
                  under this Trust  Agreement,  the Trust

                  Indenture Act and, to the extent applicable,  Rule 3a-7 under
                  the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

                        (ii)  the  Property   Trustee  shall  have  no  duty  or
                  liability  for or  with  respect  to the  value,  genuineness,
                  existence or  sufficiency of the Trust Property or the payment
                  of any taxes or  assessments  levied  thereon or in connection
                  therewith;

                       (iii) the  Property  Trustee  shall not be liable for any
                  interest  on  any  money  received  by it  except  as  it  may
                  otherwise agree with the Depositor. Money held by the Property
                  Trustee  need not be  segregated  from other  funds held by it
                  except in relation to the Payment  Account  established by the
                  Property  Trustee  pursuant to this Trust Agreement and except
                  to the extent otherwise required by law; and

                        (iv) the Property  Trustee shall not be responsible  for
                  monitoring  the compliance by the  Administrative  Trustees or
                  the Depositor  with their  respective  duties under this Trust
                  Agreement,  nor shall the  Property  Trustee be liable for the
                  default or  misconduct of the  Administrative  Trustees or the
                  Depositor.

                 Section  8.02.  Notice of Defaults.  Within five  Business Days
after the  occurrence  of any  Event of  Default,  the  Property  Trustee  shall
transmit,  in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.08,  notice of
any  default  known  to the  Property  Trustee  to the  Securityholders  and the
Depositor,  unless such default shall have been cured or waived. For the purpose
of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or
lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default.

                 Section 8.03.  Certain Rights of Property  Trustee.  Subject to
the provisions of Section 8.01 and except as provided by law:

                         (i)  the  Property   Trustee  may  rely  and  shall  be
                  protected  in acting or  refraining  from acting in good faith
                  upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate,  written
                  representation  of a  Holder  or  transferee,  certificate  of
                  auditors  or any  other  certificate,  statement,  instrument,
                  opinion, report, notice, request,  direction,  consent, order,
                  appraisal,   bond,   debenture,   note,   other   evidence  of
                  indebtedness or other paper or document reasonably believed by
                  it to be genuine and to have been signed or  presented  by the
                  proper party or parties;

                        (ii) if (A) in  performing  its duties  under this Trust
                  Agreement the Property  Trustee is required to decide  between
                  alternative  courses of action or (B) in construing any of the
                  provisions in this Trust Agreement the Property  Trustee finds
                  the same ambiguous or inconsistent  with any other  provisions

                                      -33-
<PAGE>
                  contained  herein or (C) the Property Trustee is unsure of the
                  application  of any provision of this Trust  Agreement,  then,
                  except  as  to  any   matter   as  to  which   the   Preferred
                  Securityholders  are  entitled to vote under the terms of this
                  Trust  Agreement,  the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice
                  to  the  Depositor  requesting  written  instructions  of  the
                  Depositor as to the course of action to be taken. The Property
                  Trustee  shall take such  action,  or refrain from taking such
                  action, as the Property Trustee shall be instructed in writing
                  to  take,  or  to  refrain  from  taking,  by  the  Depositor;
                  provided,  however,  that if the  Property  Trustee  does  not
                  receive such instructions of the Depositor within ten Business
                  Days after it has delivered  such notice,  or such  reasonably
                  shorter  period of time set forth in such notice (which to the
                  extent  practicable shall not be less than two Business Days),
                  it may,  but shall be under no duty to,  take or refrain  from
                  taking such action not inconsistent  with this Trust Agreement
                  as it shall deem  advisable  and in the best  interests of the
                  Securityholders,  in which event the  Property  Trustee  shall
                  have no liability except for its own bad faith,  negligence or
                  willful misconduct;

                       (iii)  whenever  in  the  administration  of  this  Trust
                  Agreement the Property  Trustee shall deem it desirable that a
                  matter be proved or established prior to taking,  suffering or
                  omitting any action  hereunder,  the Property  Trustee (unless
                  other evidence be herein specifically  prescribed) may, in the
                  absence  of bad  faith on its part,  request  and rely upon an
                  Officers'  Certificate  which,  upon receipt of such  request,
                  shall  be  promptly   delivered   by  the   Depositor  or  the
                  Administrative Trustees;

                        (iv) the  Property  Trustee may consult  with counsel of
                  its  selection  and the written  advice of such counsel or any
                  Opinion of Counsel  shall be full and  complete  authorization
                  and  protection  in respect of any action  taken,  suffered or
                  omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

                         (v) the Property  Trustee  shall be under no obligation
                  to exercise  any of the rights or powers  vested in it by this
                  Trust  Agreement  at the  request or  direction  of any of the
                  Securityholders pursuant to this Trust Agreement,  unless such
                  Securityholders  shall have  offered to the  Property  Trustee
                  reasonable  security or indemnity against the costs,  expenses
                  (including   reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  expenses)  and
                  liabilities  which might be incurred by it in  complying  with
                  such request or direction;

                        (vi) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any
                  investigation   into  the  facts  or  matters  stated  in  any
                  resolution,   certificate,   statement,  instrument,  opinion,
                  report, notice, request, direction,  consent, order, approval,
                  bond,  debenture,  note or other evidence of  indebtedness  or
                  other  paper  or  document  reasonably  believed  by  it to be
                  genuine,  unless  requested in writing to do so by one or more
                  Securityholders,  but the Property Trustee, in 

                                      -34-
<PAGE>
                  its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation
                  into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the 
                  Property  Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry
                  or investigation, it shall  be  entitled to examine the books,
                  records  and premises of the Depositor personally or by agent
                  or attorney;

                       (vii) the Property  Trustee may execute any of the trusts
                  or powers  hereunder  or perform any duties  hereunder  either
                  directly  or by or through  its agents or  attorneys,  and the
                  Property  Trustee shall not be responsible  for any misconduct
                  or negligence  on the part of any agent or attorney  appointed
                  with  due care by it  hereunder,  provided  that the  Property
                  Trustee  shall  be  responsible  for  its  own  negligence  or
                  recklessness  with  respect  to  selection  of  any  agent  or
                  attorney appointed by it hereunder;

                      (viii) the  Property  Trustee  shall not be liable for any
                  action taken,  suffered,  or omitted to be taken by it in good
                  faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within
                  the  discretion or rights or powers  conferred upon it by this
                  Trust Agreement;

                        (ix) the  Property  Trustee  shall not be  charged  with
                  knowledge  of any default or Event of Default  with respect to
                  the Trust Securities  unless either (1) a Responsible  Officer
                  of the  Property  Trustee  shall have actual  knowledge of the
                  default  or Event of  Default  or (2)  written  notice of such
                  default  or Event of  Default  shall  have  been  given to the
                  Property Trustee by the Depositor, the Administrative Trustees
                  or by any Holder of the Trust Securities;

                         (x) no  provision  of this  Trust  Agreement  shall  be
                  deemed  to  impose  any  duty or  obligation  on the  Property
                  Trustee  to  perform  any act or acts or  exercise  any right,
                  power,  duty or  obligation  conferred or imposed on it in any
                  jurisdiction  in which it shall be  illegal,  or in which  the
                  Property  Trustee  shall  be  unqualified  or  incompetent  in
                  accordance  with  applicable  law,  to perform any such act or
                  acts or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation;
                  and  no  permissive  or   discretionary   power  or  authority
                  available to the Property  Trustee  shall be construed to be a
                  duty;

                        (xi) no provision of this Trust  Agreement shall require
                  the  Property  Trustee  to  expend  or risk  its own  funds or
                  otherwise   incur   personal   financial   liability   in  the
                  performance  of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
                  its  rights or  powers,  if the  Property  Trustee  shall have
                  reasonable  grounds for  believing  that the repayment of such
                  funds or liability is not  reasonably  assured to it under the
                  terms of this Trust  Agreement or adequate  indemnity  against
                  such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it;

                       (xii) the Property  Trustee  shall have no duty to see to
                  any  recording,  filing  or  registration  of  any  instrument
                  (including any financing or continuation  

                                      -35-

                  statement or any tax or securities) (or any  rerecording,  
                  refiling or registration thereof);

                      (xiii) the  Property  Trustee  shall have the right at any
                  time to seek  instructions  concerning the  administration  of
                  this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction;
                  and

                       (xiv)  whenever  in  the  administration  of  this  Trust
                  Agreement  the  Property  Trustee  shall deem it  desirable to
                  receive  instructions  with respect to enforcing any remedy or
                  right or  taking  any  other  action  hereunder  the  Property
                  Trustee (i) may request  instructions  from the Holders of the
                  Trust Securities,  which instructions may only be given by the
                  Holders of the same  proportion of  Liquidation  Amount of the
                  Trust  Securities  as would be entitled to direct the Property
                  Trustee under the terms of this Trust  Agreement in respect of
                  such  remedies,  rights  or  actions,  (ii) may  refrain  from
                  enforcing  such  remedy or right or taking  such other  action
                  until  such  instructions  are  received,  and (iii)  shall be
                  protected in acting in accordance with such instructions.

                  Section  8.04.  Not  Responsible  for  Recitals or Issuance of
Securities.   The  recitals   contained  herein  and  in  the  Trust  Securities
Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Trust, and the Trustees do
not  assume any  responsibility  for their  correctness.  The  Trustees  make no
representations as to the value or condition of the property of the Trust or any
part  thereof  or as to the title of the  Trust  thereto  or as to the  security
afforded  thereby  or  hereby,  or as to  the  validity  or  genuineness  of any
securities at any time pledged and deposited with any Trustees hereunder, nor as
to the validity or sufficiency of this Trust Agreement or the Trust  Securities.
The Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Trust of
the proceeds of the Trust Securities in accordance with Section 2.05.

                  Section 8.05. May Hold  Securities.  Except as provided in the
definition  of the term  "Outstanding"  in Article  I, any  Trustee or any other
agent of any Trustee or the Trust, in its individual or any other capacity,  may
become the owner or pledgee of Trust  Securities and may otherwise deal with the
Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not a Trustee or such other
agent.

                  Section 8.06. Compensation; Fees; Indemnity.

                  The Depositor agrees

                  (1) to pay  to the  Trustees  from  time  to  time  reasonable
         compensation for all services rendered by the Trustees hereunder (which
         compensation  shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to
         the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

                  (2)  except  as  otherwise   expressly   provided  herein,  to
         reimburse  the  Trustees  upon  request  for all  reasonable  expenses,
         disbursements and advances  reasonably incurred or made by the Trustees
         in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the
         reasonable  compensation  and the  expenses  and  disbursements  of its
         agents and counsel),  except any such expense,  disbursement or advance
         as may be attributable to its negligence (gross negligence, in the case
         of any Administrative Trustee), bad faith or willful misconduct; and

                  (3) to  indemnify  each  Trustee for, and to hold each Trustee
         harmless  against,  any and all  loss,  damage,  claims,  liability  or
         expense incurred without negligence (gross  negligence,  in the case of
         any  Administrative  Trustee),  bad faith or willful  misconduct on its
         part,   arising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  the  acceptance  or
         administration of this Trust Agreement,  including the reasonable costs
         and  expenses of  defending  itself  against any claim or  liability in
         connection  with the  exercise or  performance  of any of its powers or
         duties hereunder.

                  As security  for the  performance  of the  obligations  of the
Depositor  under this Section,  each of the Trustees  shall have a lien prior to
the Trust  Securities  upon all  property  and funds held or  collected  by such
Trustee as such,  except funds held in trust for the payment of Distributions on
the Trust Securities.

                  The  provisions of this Section shall survive the  termination
of this Trust Agreement.

                  Section 8.07.  Certain  Trustees  Required;  Eligibility.  (a)
There shall at all times be a Property  Trustee  hereunder  with  respect to the

capital  and  surplus  of at least  $50,000,000.  If any such  Person  publishes
reports of condition at least annually,  pursuant to law or to the  requirements
of its  supervising  or  examining  authority,  then  for the  purposes  of this
Section,  the combined  capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be
its  combined  capital  and  surplus as set forth in its most  recent  report of
condition so published.  If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the
Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of
this  Section,  it shall  resign  immediately  in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article VIII.

                  (b)  There  shall at all  times be one or more  Administrative

         21 years of age or a legal  entity  that shall act  through one or more
         persons authorized to bind such entity.

                  (c)  There  shall at all  times  be a  Delaware  Trustee  with
         respect to the Trust  Securities.  The Delaware Trustee shall either be
         (i) a natural  person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of
         the State of Delaware or (ii) a legal entity with its  principal  place
         of  business  in  the  State  of  Delaware  that  otherwise  meets the

                                      -37-
<PAGE>
         requirements of applicable  Delaware law and that shall act through
         one or more persons authorized to bind such entity.

                  Section 8.08. Conflicting Interests.

                  If the  Property  Trustee has or shall  acquire a  conflicting
interest  within the meaning of the Trust  Indenture  Act, the Property  Trustee
shall either eliminate such interest or resign,  to the extent and in the manner
provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust  Indenture Act and this
Trust Agreement. The Subordinated Indenture and the Guarantee Agreement shall be
deemed to be specifically  described in this Trust Agreement for the purposes of
clause  (i) of the  first  proviso  contained  in  Section  310(b)  of the Trust
Indenture Act.

                  Section  8.09.   Co-Trustees  and  Separate  Trustee.

                  Unless a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing,  at any  time or  times,  for  the  purpose  of  meeting  the  legal
requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part
of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Depositor and the Property
Trustee  shall  have  power to  appoint,  and upon the  written  request  of the
Property  Trustee,  the Depositor  shall for such purpose join with the Property
Trustee in the  execution,  delivery,  and  performance of all  instruments  and
agreements  necessary or proper to appoint,  one or more Persons approved by the
Property Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee,
of all or any part of such Trust Property,  or to act as separate trustee of any
such  property,  in  either  case with such  powers  as may be  provided  in the
instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity
aforesaid,  any property,  title,  right or power deemed necessary or desirable,
subject to the other provisions of this Section.  If the Depositor does not join
in such  appointment  within 15 days after the  receipt by it of a request so to
do, or in case an Event of Default under the Subordinated Indenture has occurred
and is  continuing,  the  Property  Trustee  alone shall have power to make such
appointment.

                  Should any written  instrument  from the Depositor be required
by any co-trustee or separate  trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to
such co-trustee or separate trustee such property,  title,  right, or power, any
and all such  instruments  shall,  on request,  be executed,  acknowledged,  and
delivered by the Depositor.

                  Every  co-trustee  or separate  trustee  shall,  to the extent
permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following
terms, namely:

                  (1) The Trust  Securities  shall be executed and delivered and
         all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the
         custody of  securities,  cash and other  personal  property held by, or
         required to be deposited or pledged with,  the Trustees  designated for
         such purpose hereunder, shall be exercised, solely by such Trustees.

                                      -38-

                  (2)  The  rights,   powers,  duties,  and  obligations  hereby
         conferred  or  imposed  upon the  Property  Trustee  in  respect of any
         property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon
         and  exercised or performed by the Property  Trustee or by the Property
         Trustee and such co-trustee or separate  trustee  jointly,  as shall be
         provided  in the  instrument  appointing  such  co-trustee  or separate
         trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in
         which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall
         be  incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such
         rights,   powers,  duties,  and  obligations  shall  be  exercised  and
         performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee.

                  (3) The  Property  Trustee at any time,  by an  instrument  in
         writing executed by it, with the written  concurrence of the Depositor,
         may accept the  resignation  of or remove any  co-trustee  or  separate
         trustee  appointed  under this Section  8.09,  and, in case an Event of
         Default   under  the   Subordinated   Indenture  has  occurred  and  is
         continuing,  the  Property  Trustee  shall  have  power to  accept  the
         resignation  of, or remove,  any such  co-trustee  or separate  trustee
         without the  concurrence of the Depositor.  Upon the written request of
         the  Property  Trustee,  the  Depositor  shall  join with the  Property
         Trustee in the execution,  delivery, and performance of all instruments
         and agreements  necessary or proper to effectuate  such  resignation or
         removal.  A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned
         or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section.

                  (4) No  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee  hereunder  shall be
         personally  liable by reason of any act or omission of the Trustee,  or
         any other such trustee hereunder.

                  (5)  The Property Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any
         act of a  co-trustee or separate trustee.

                  (6) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall
         be deemed to have been  delivered to each such  co-trustee and separate
         trustee.

                  Section  8.10.   Resignation   and  Removal;   Appointment  of
Successor.  No  resignation  or removal of any  Trustee (as the case may be, the
"Relevant  Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee pursuant
to this Article shall become  effective  until the  acceptance of appointment by
the successor Relevant Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of
Section 8.11.

                  The Relevant  Trustee may resign at any time by giving written
notice  thereof to the  Securityholders.  If the  instrument  of acceptance by a
successor  Relevant  Trustee  required  by  Section  8.11  shall  not have  been
delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice
of  resignation,  the  resigning  Relevant  Trustee  may  petition  any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

                  Unless a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Relevant Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Common
Securityholder.  If a  Debenture  Event of Default  shall have  occurred  and be
continuing,  the  Relevant  Trustee  may be  removed  at such time by Act of the
Securityholders  of a  majority  of  the  aggregate  Liquidation  Amount  of the
Outstanding  Preferred  Securities,  delivered to the  Relevant  Trustee (in its
individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust).

                  If the Relevant  Trustee  shall  resign,  be removed or become
incapable of continuing  to act as Relevant  Trustee at a time when no Debenture
Event  of  Default   shall  have   occurred  and  be   continuing,   the  Common
Securityholder,  by Act of the Common  Securityholder  delivered to the retiring
Relevant  Trustee,  shall  promptly  appoint a  successor  Relevant  Trustee  or
Trustees,  and the retiring  Relevant  Trustee shall comply with the  applicable
requirements of Section 8.11. If the Relevant  Trustee shall resign,  be removed
or become  incapable of continuing to act as the Relevant Trustee at a time when
a  Debenture  Event of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be  continuing,  the
Preferred Securityholders, by Act of the Preferred Securityholders of a majority
in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding  Preferred  Securities delivered to the
retiring Relevant Trustee,  shall promptly appoint a successor  Relevant Trustee
or  Trustees,  and  the  Relevant  Trustee  shall  comply  with  the  applicable
requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor  Relevant  Trustee shall have been
so appointed by the Common Securityholders or the Preferred  Securityholders and
accepted  appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Securityholder
who has been a Securityholder  for at least six months may, on behalf of himself
and all others similarly situated,  petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.

                  The  retiring  Relevant  Trustee  shall  give  notice  of each
resignation and each removal of the Relevant  Trustee and each  appointment of a
successor Trustee to all Securityholders in the manner provided in Section 10.08
and shall give notice to the  Depositor.  Each notice shall include the name and
address of the  successor  Relevant  Trustee  and,  in the case of the  Property
Trustee, the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

                  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any other  provision of this
Trust Agreement,  in the event any Administrative  Trustee or a Delaware Trustee
who is a natural  person  dies or  becomes  incompetent  or  incapacitated,  the
vacancy  created by such death,  incompetence or incapacity may be filled by (i)
the unanimous act of remaining Administrative Trustees if there are at least two
of them or (ii)  otherwise  by the  Depositor  (with the  successor in each case
being  an   individual   who   satisfies  the   eligibility   requirements   for
Administrative  Trustees or Delaware  Trustee,  as the case may be, set forth in
Section  8.07).  Additionally,   notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or  any  other
provision  of this  Trust  Agreement,  in the  event  the  Depositor  reasonably
believes  that any  Administrative  Trustee  who is a natural  person has become
incompetent  or  incapacitated,  the  Depositor,  by  notice  to  the  remaining
Trustees,  may terminate the status of such Person as an Administrative  Trustee
(in which  case the  vacancy so created  will be filled in  accordance  with the
preceding sentence).

                  Section 8.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.  In case
of the  appointment  hereunder  of a successor  Relevant  Trustee,  the retiring
Relevant  Trustee  and each  successor  Trustee  shall  execute  and  deliver an
amendment  hereto  wherein each  successor  Relevant  Trustee  shall accept such
appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or
desirable  to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each  successor  Relevant
Trustee  all the  rights,  powers,  trusts and duties of the  retiring  Relevant
Trustee with respect to the Trust  Securities and the Trust and (2) shall add to
or change any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall be necessary to
provide for or facilitate  the  administration  of the trusts  hereunder by more
than one Relevant  Trustee,  it being  understood that nothing herein or in such
amendment shall constitute such Relevant Trustees  co-trustees of the same trust
and that  each  such  Relevant  Trustee  shall be  trustee  of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder  administered by
any other such  Relevant  Trustee and upon the  execution  and  delivery of such
amendment  the  resignation  or removal of the retiring  Relevant  Trustee shall
become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant
Trustee,  without any further act, deed or conveyance,  shall become vested with
all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but,
on request of the Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant
Trustee shall duly assign,  transfer and deliver to such  successor  Trustee all
Trust Property,  all proceeds  thereof and money held by such retiring  Relevant
Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust.

                  Upon  request  of any such  successor  Relevant  Trustee,  the
retiring  Relevant  Trustee shall execute any and all instruments for more fully
and certainly  vesting in and confirming to such successor  Relevant Trustee all
such  rights,  powers and trusts  referred  to in the first or second  preceding
paragraph, as the case may be.

                  No successor  Relevant  Trustee  shall accept its  appointment
unless at the time of such acceptance such successor  Relevant  Trustee shall be
qualified and eligible under this Article VIII.

                  Section 8.12. Merger, Conversion,  Consolidation or Succession
to Business.  Any Person into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee
or any Administrative Trustee or any Trustee that is not a natural person may be
merged  or  converted  or  with  which  it may be  consolidated,  or any  Person
resulting from any merger,  conversion or  consolidation  to which such Relevant
Trustee shall be a party, or any Person  succeeding to all or substantially  all
the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of
such  Relevant  Trustee  hereunder,  provided  such  Person  shall be  otherwise
qualified and eligible under this Article VIII,  without the execution or filing
of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.

                  Section  8.13.   Preferential  Collection  of  Claims  Against
Depositor  or  Trust.  If and when the  Property  Trustee  shall be or  become a
creditor of the Depositor or the Trust (or any other obligor upon the Debentures
or  the  Trust  Securities),  the  Property  

                                      -41-
<PAGE>
Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust  Indenture Act regarding
the  collection  of claims  against  the  Depositor  or Trust (or any such other
obligor).

                  Section 8.14.  Reports by Property  Trustee.  (a) the Property
Trustee shall transmit to  Securityholders  such reports concerning the Property
Trustee and its actions under this Trust  Agreement as may be required  pursuant
to the Trust  Indenture  Act at the times and in the  manner  provided  pursuant
thereto. Such of those reports as are required to be transmitted by the Property
Trustee  pursuant  to  Section  313(a)  of the Trust  Indenture  Act shall be so
transmitted within 60 days after July 31 of each year, commencing July 31, 1996.

                  (b) A copy of each  such  report  shall,  at the  time of such
transmission  to  Holders,  be filed by the  Property  Trustee  with each  stock
exchange upon which the Trust  Securities  are listed,  with the  Commission and
with the  Depositor.  The  Depositor  will notify the Property  Trustee when any
Trust Securities are listed on any stock exchange.

                  Section 8.15.  Reports to the Property Trustee.  The Depositor
and the  Administrative  Trustees  on behalf of the Trust  shall  provide to the
Property Trustee such documents,  reports and information as required by Section
314 (if any) and the compliance certificate required by Section 314 of the Trust
Indenture  Act in the form,  in the manner and at the times  required by Section
314 of the Trust Indenture Act.

                  Section   8.16.   Evidence  of  Compliance   With   Conditions
Precedent.  Each of the Depositor and the  Administrative  Trustees on behalf of
the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such evidence of compliance with
any  conditions  precedent,  if  any,  provided  for  in  this  Trust  Agreement
(including  any  covenants   compliance  with  which   constitutes  a  condition
precedent)  that relate to any of the matters set forth in Section 314(c) of the
Trust  Indenture  Act.  Any  certificate  or opinion  required to be given by an
officer pursuant to Section 314(c)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act may be given in
the form of an Officers' Certificate.

                  Section 8.17. Number of Trustees.

                  (a) The  number  of  Trustees  shall  be five,  provided  that
Depositor,  by  written  instrument  may  increase  or  decrease  the  number of
Administrative Trustees.

                  (b) If a Trustee  ceases to hold office for any reason and the
number of Administrative Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 8.17(a), or
if the number of Trustees is increased  pursuant to Section  8.17(a),  a vacancy
shall occur. The vacancy shall be filled with a Trustee  appointed in accordance
with Section 8.10.

                  (c) The death, resignation,  retirement,  removal, bankruptcy,
incompetence  or incapacity to perform the duties of a Trustee shall not operate
to annul the Trust. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Administrative  Trustees
shall  occur,   until  such  vacancy  is  filled  by  the   appointment   of  an
Administrative  Trustee in  accordance  with Section  8.10,  the  

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

Administrative   Trustees   in  office,   regardless   of  their   number   (and
notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this  Agreement),  shall  have all the
powers granted to the Administrative Trustees and shall discharge all the duties
imposed upon the Administrative Trustees by this Trust Agreement.

                  Section 8.18. Delegation of Power.

                  (a) Any  Administrative  Trustee  may,  by power  of  attorney
consistent with  applicable  law,  delegate to any other natural person over the
age  of 21  his  or her  power  for  the  purpose  of  executing  any  documents
contemplated  in  Section  2.07(a),  including  any  registration  statement  or
amendment  thereto filed with the Commission,  or making any other  governmental
filing; and

                  (b) the  Administrative  Trustees shall have power to delegate
from  time to time to such of their  number  the  doing of such  things  and the
execution  of such  instruments  either in the name of the Trust or the names of
the Administrative Trustees or otherwise as the Administrative Trustees may deem
expedient,  to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or
contrary to the provisions of the Trust, as set forth herein.

                  Section 8.19. Fiduciary Duty.

                  (a) To the extent that,  at law or in equity,  an  Indemnified
Person has duties (including  fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto
to the Trust or to any other Covered Person, an Indemnified  Person acting under
this Trust  Agreement  shall not be liable to the Trust or to any other  Covered
Person for its good faith  reliance on the  provisions of this Trust  Agreement.
The  provisions  of this Trust  Agreement,  to the extent that they restrict the
duties and liabilities of an Indemnified  Person otherwise existing at law or in
equity  (other than the duties  imposed on the Property  Trustee under the Trust
Indenture  Act),  are agreed by the parties  hereto to replace such other duties
and liabilities of such Indemnified Person;

                  (b) Unless otherwise  expressly provided herein and subject to
the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act:

                         (i)  whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises
between an Indemnified Person and any Covered Person; or

                        (ii)  whenever   this  Trust   Agreement  or  any  other
                  agreement  contemplated  herein or  therein  provides  that an
                  Indemnified  Person shall act in a manner that is, or provides
                  terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Trust or any Holder
                  of Trust Securities, the Indemnified Person shall resolve such
                  conflict of interest,  take such action or provide such terms,
                  considering  in each case the relative  interest of each party
                  (including  its own  interest)  to such  conflict,  agreement,
                  transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating
                  to  

                                      -43-
<PAGE>
                  such  interests,   any  customary  or  accepted   industry
                  practices,  and any applicable  generally accepted  accounting
                  practices  or  principles.  In the absence of bad faith by the
                  Indemnified  Person,  the resolution,  action or term so made,
                  taken  or  provided  by  the  Indemnified   Person  shall  not
                  constitute  a breach  of this  Trust  Agreement  or any  other
                  agreement  contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of
                  the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or otherwise; and

                  (c) Unless otherwise  expressly provided herein and subject to
the provisions of the Trust  Indenture Act,  whenever in this Trust Agreement an
Indemnified Person is permitted or required to make a decision

                         (i) in its  "discretion"  or under a grant  of  similar
                  authority,   the  Indemnified  Person  shall  be  entitled  to
                  consider such interests and factors as it reasonably  desires,
                  including  its  own  interests,  and  shall  have  no  duty or
                  obligation  to give any  consideration  to any  interest of or
                  factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or

                        (ii)  in its  "good  faith"  or  under  another  express
                  standard,  the Indemnified Person shall act under such express
                  standard  and shall not be subject  to any other or  different
                  standard imposed by this Trust Agreement or by applicable law.


                                   ARTICLE IX.

the Trust shall terminate and the Trustees shall take such action as is required
by Section 9.04.

                  receive  a  Liquidation  Distribution,  as the  Administrative
                  Trustees or the Property Trustee shall deem appropriate.

                  (b) In order to effect any liquidation of the Trust hereunder,
and  any  resulting  distribution  of the  Debentures  to  Securityholders,  the
Property  Trustee  shall  establish a record date for such  distribution  (which
shall be not more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself
acting as  exchange  agent or through  the  appointment  of a separate  exchange
agent,  shall establish such  procedures as it shall deem  appropriate to effect
the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding  Trust Securities
Certificates.

                  (c) After any Liquidation  Date, (i) the Trust Securities will
no longer be deemed to be  Outstanding,  (ii)  certificates  representing a Like
Amount of Debentures will be 

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such Trust
Securities  Certificates  to the  Administrative  Trustees  or their  agent  for
exchange,  (iii)  any  Trust  Securities  Certificates  not so  surrendered  for
exchange  will be deemed to  represent  a Like  Amount of  Debentures,  accruing
interest at the rate provided for in the Debentures  from the last  Distribution
Date on which a  Distribution  was made on such  Trust  Certificates  until such
Trust  Securities   Certificates  are  so  surrendered  (and  until  such  Trust
Securities Certificates are so surrendered, no payments or interest or principal
will be made to Holders of Trust  Securities  Certificates  with respect to such
Debentures) and (iv) all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities will
cease,  except  the right of such  Securityholders  to receive  Debentures  upon
surrender of Trust Securities Certificates.

                  (d) If at  any  time,  a  Special  Event  shall  occur  and be
continuing,  the Depositor  has the right to (i) redeem the  Debentures in whole
but not in part and therefore cause a mandatory  redemption of all the Preferred
Securities at the  Redemption  Price within 90 days  following the occurrence of
such Special Event, or (ii) cause the termination of the Trust.  Further,  if at
any time,  the Trust is not or will not be taxed as a  grantor  trust  under the
United  States  federal  income tax law, but a Tax Event has not  occurred,  the
Depositor may elect  termination of the Trust. In the event the Depositor elects
under  the  provisions  of this  section  for the  Trust to be  terminated,  the
Administrative  Trustees shall,  terminate the Trust and, after  satisfaction of
creditors of the Trust, if any, as provided by applicable law, cause  Debentures
held by the Property  Trustee  having a Like Amount of the Preferred  Securities
and the Common  Securities  to be  distributed  to the Holders of the  Preferred
Securities and the Common  Securities on a pro rata basis in liquidation of such
Holders'  interests in the Trust (in the case of such an election  following the
occurrence of a Special  Event) within 90 days  following the occurrence of such
Special Event.  The Common  Securities will be redeemed on a pro rata basis with
the  Preferred  Securities,  except  that if a  Debenture  Event of Default  has
occurred and is continuing,  the Preferred  Securities will have a priority over
the Common  Securities  with  respect to  payment  of the  Redemption  Price and
accumulated and unpaid Distributions to the date of such payment.

                  (e) In the event that, notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Section  9.04,  whether  because of an order for  termination  entered by a
court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise,  distribution of the Debentures in
the manner  provided  herein is  determined  by the  Property  Trustee not to be
practical,  the Trust  Property  shall be  liquidated,  and the  Trust  shall be
dissolved, wound-up or terminated, by the Property Trustee in such manner as the
Property  Trustee  determines.  In such event,  on the date of the  dissolution,
winding-up or other termination of the Trust,  Securityholders  will be entitled
to  receive  out of the  assets  of the  Trust  available  for  distribution  to
Securityholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust, if
any, as provided by applicable  law, an amount equal to the  Liquidation  Amount
per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date
of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If, upon any such
dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid
only in part because the Trust has insufficient  assets available to pay in full
the aggregate  Liquidation  Distribution,  then,  subject to the next succeeding
sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

on  the  Trust  Securities  shall  be  paid  on a pro  rata  basis  (based  upon
Liquidation  Amounts).  The  Holder of Common  Securities  will be  entitled  to
receive  Liquidation  Distributions  upon any such  dissolution,  winding-up  or
termination  pro rata  (determined  as  aforesaid)  with  Holders  of  Preferred
Securities,  except  that,  if a Debenture  Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing or if a Debenture  Event of Default has not occurred solely by reason
of a requirement  that time lapse or notice be given,  the Preferred  Securities
shall have a priority over the Common Securities.

                                   ARTICLE X.

                            Miscellaneous Provisions

                  Section  10.01.  Guarantee by the Depositor and  Assumption of
Obligations.   Subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  hereof,  the  Depositor
irrevocably and  unconditionally  guarantees to each Person to whom the Trust is
now or hereafter becomes indebted or liable (the "Beneficiaries"), and agrees to
assume  liability  for,  the  full  payment,  when  and as  due,  of any and all
Obligations  (as  hereinafter  defined) to such  Beneficiaries.  As used herein,
"Obligations"  means any  indebtedness,  expenses or  liabilities  of the Trust,
other than obligations of the Trust to pay to Holders or other similar interests
in the Trust the amounts due such Holders pursuant to the terms of the Preferred
Securities or such other similar  interests,  as the case may be. This guarantee
and assumption is intended to be for the benefit,  of, and to be enforceable by,
all such  Beneficiaries,  whether or not such Beneficiaries have received notice
hereof.

                  Section 10.02.  Limitation of Rights of  Securityholders.  The
death or incapacity  of any person having an interest,  beneficial or otherwise,
in a Trust  Security shall not operate to terminate  this Trust  Agreement,  nor
entitle the legal  representatives or heirs of such person or any Securityholder
for such person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding
in any court for a  partition  or  winding up of the  arrangements  contemplated
hereby,  nor otherwise  affect the rights,  obligations  and  liabilities of the
parties hereto or any of them.

                  Section 10.03. Amendment.

                  (a) This Trust  Agreement  may be amended from time to time by
the Trust (on  approval of a majority  of the  Administrative  Trustees  and the
Depositor,  without  the  consent  of  any  Securityholders),  (i) to  cure  any
ambiguity,  correct or supplement  any provision  herein or therein which may be
inconsistent  with any other provision  herein or therein,  or to make any other
provisions  with  respect  to  matters  or  questions  arising  under this Trust
Agreement,  which shall not be  inconsistent  with the other  provisions of this
Trust  Agreement or (ii) to modify,  eliminate or add to any  provisions of this
Trust  Agreement  to such extent as shall be  necessary to ensure that the Trust
will not be classified  for United States federal income tax purposes other than
as a "grantor  trust" and not as an association  taxable as a 

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

corporation at any time that any Trust  Securities are  outstanding or to ensure
the  Trust's  exemption  from the status of an  "investment  company"  under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;  provided,  however, that, except in
the case of clause (ii), such action shall not adversely  affect in any material
respect the interests of any Securityholder  and, in the case of clause (i), any
amendments of this Trust Agreement shall become effective when notice thereof is
given to the Securityholders.

                  (b) Except as provided in Sections  6.01(c) and 10.03(c),  any
provision of this Trust Agreement may be amended by the Administrative  Trustees
and  the  Depositor  with  (i)  the  consent  of  Holders  of  Trust  Securities
representing  not less than a majority (based upon  Liquidation  Amounts) of the
Outstanding  Trust  Securities and (ii) receipt by the Trustees of an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such  amendment or the exercise of any power  granted
to the Trustees in accordance  with such  amendment  will not affect the Trust's
status as a  grantor  trust for  federal  income  tax  purposes  or the  Trust's
exemption  from status of an "investment  company" under the Investment  Company
Act of 1940, as amended.

                  (c) In addition to and  notwithstanding any other provision in
this Trust Agreement,  without the consent of each affected Securityholder (such
consent  being  obtained in  accordance  with Section 6.03 or 6.06),  this Trust
Agreement  may  not be  amended  to (i)  change  the  amount  or  timing  of any
Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of
any Distribution  required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a
specified date or (ii) restrict the right of a Securityholder  to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date.

                  (d)   Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of  this  Trust
Agreement, no Trustee shall enter into or consent to any amendment to this Trust
Agreement  which  would  cause  the  Trust to fail or cease to  qualify  for the
exemption  from status of an "investment  company" under the Investment  Company
Act of 1940, as amended, afforded by Rule 3a-5 thereunder.

                  (e)  Notwithstanding  anything in this Trust  Agreement to the
contrary,  without the consent of the  Depositor  and the  Trustees,  this Trust
Agreement may not be amended in a manner which imposes any additional obligation
on the Depositor or any Trustee.

                  (f) In the event that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is
made, the Administrative Trustees shall promptly provide to the Depositor a copy
of such amendment.

                  (g) The Property  Trustee is entitled to receive an Opinion of
Counsel as  conclusive  evidence  that any  amendment  to this  Trust  Agreement
executed  pursuant to this Section  10.03 is  authorized  or  permitted  by, and
conforms to, the terms of this Section  10.03,  has been duly  authorized by and
lawfully  executed and delivered on behalf of the other requisite  parties,  and
that it is proper for the Property  Trustee under the provisions of this Section
10.03 to join in the execution thereof.

remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  Section 10.09. Agreement Not to Petition. Each of the Trustees
and the Depositor agrees for the benefit of the  Securityholders  that, until at
least one year and one day after the  Trust has been  terminated  in  accordance

required or deemed provision shall control.

                  (d) The  application of the Trust  Indenture Act to this Trust

AGREEMENT OF THE TRUST, SUCH SECURITYHOLDER AND SUCH OTHERS THAT THOSE TERMS AND

proposed action  (including any covenants  compliance  with which  constitutes a

as to which the  furnishing of such  documents is  specifically  required by any
provision of this Indenture relating to such particular  application or request,

               (a) a statement  that each Person  signing  such  certificate  or

SECTION 103. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.

               In any case where  several  matters are  required to be certified
by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified  Person, it is not necessary that
all such  matters be  certified  by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
Person,  or that they be so certified or covered by only one  document,  but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion  with respect to some matters and one
or more other such Persons as to other matters,  and any such Person may certify
or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

               Any  certificate  or opinion of an officer of the  Company may be
based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of,
or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or  representations
with respect to the matters upon which such Officer's Certificate or opinion are
based are  erroneous.  Any such  certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based,
insofar as it relates to factual  matters,  upon a certificate or opinion of, or
representations  by, an officer or  officers  of the  Company  stating  that the
information  with respect to such factual  matters is in the  possession  of the
Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should
know,  that the certificate or opinion or  representations  with respect to such
matters are erroneous.

               Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications,  requests, consents,  certificates,  statements, opinions or other
instruments  under this Indenture,  they may, but need not, be consolidated  and
form one instrument.

               Whenever,  subsequent  to the receipt by the Trustee of any Board
Resolution,  Officer's  Certificate,  Opinion of Counsel  or other  document  or
instrument,  a clerical,  typographical  or other  inadvertent or  unintentional
error or omission shall be discovered  therein, a new document or instrument may
be  substituted  therefor in corrected form with the same force and effect as if
originally filed in the corrected form and, irrespective of the date or dates of
the actual  execution  and/or  delivery  thereof,  such  substitute  document or
instrument shall be deemed to have been executed and/or delivered as of the date
or dates  required  with respect to the document or  instrument  for which it is
substituted. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding,  if any
such corrective  document or instrument  indicates that action has been taken by
or at the  request  of the  Company  which  could  not have  been  taken had the
original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action
so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be
and remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that such action was a
result of willful

<PAGE>
                                       -9-

misconduct or bad faith.  Without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  
any  Securities  issued under the  authority of such  defective document  or  
instrument  shall  nevertheless  be the valid  obligations  of the Company 
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture  equally and ratably with all
other Outstanding Securities, except as aforesaid.

SECTION 104. Acts of Holders.

               (a)  Any  request,  demand,  authorization,   direction,  notice,
      consent, election, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be
      made, given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or
      more instruments of substantially  similar tenor signed by such Holders in
      person or by an agent duly appointed in writing or, alternatively,  may be
      embodied  in and  evidenced  by the  record  of  Holders  voting  in favor
      thereof,  either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any
      meeting of Holders duly called and held in accordance  with the provisions
      of Article  Thirteen,  or a combination of such  instruments  and any such
      record.  Except as herein otherwise expressly provided,  such action shall
      become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are
      delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby  expressly  required,  to
      the Company.  Such  instrument or instruments and any such record (and the
      action  embodied  therein  and  evidenced  thereby)  are herein  sometimes
      referred  to as the  "Act"  of the  Holders  signing  such  instrument  or
      instruments  and so voting at any such meeting.  Proof of execution of any
      such  instrument  or of a writing  appointing  any such  agent,  or of the
      holding by any Person of a Security,  shall be sufficient  for any purpose
      of this Indenture and (subject to Section 901)  conclusive in favor of the
      Trustee and the Company,  if made in the manner  provided in this Section.
      The  record of any  meeting  of  Holders  shall be  proved  in the  manner
      provided in Section 1306.

               (b) The fact and date of the  execution by any Person of any such
      instrument  or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
      execution  or  by a  certificate  of a  notary  public  or  other  officer
      authorized by law to take  acknowledgments  of deeds,  certifying that the
      individual  signing such  instrument  or writing  acknowledged  to him the
      execution  thereof or may be proved in any other  manner which the Trustee
      and the  Company  deem  sufficient.  Where such  execution  is by a signer
      acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity,  such certificate
      or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.

               (c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Securities held by
      any  Person,  and the date of  holding  the  same,  shall be proved by the
      Security Register.

               (d)  Any  request,  demand,  authorization,   direction,  notice,
      consent, election, waiver or other Act of a Holder shall bind every future
      Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every  Security  issued upon
      the  registration of transfer  thereof or in exchange  therefor or in lieu
      thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the
      Trustee or the Company in  reliance  thereon,  whether or not  notation of
      such action is made upon such Security.

<PAGE>
                                       -10-

               (e)  Until  such  time as  written  instruments  shall  have been
      delivered  to the Trustee  with  respect to the  requisite  percentage  of
      principal  amount  of  Securities  for  the  action  contemplated  by such
      instruments, any such instrument executed and delivered by or on behalf of
      a Holder may be revoked with respect to any or all of such  Securities  by
      written  notice by such  Holder or any  subsequent  Holder,  proven in the
      manner in which such instrument was proven.

               (f) Securities of any series  authenticated  and delivered  after
      any Act of Holders  may,  and shall if  required  by the  Trustee,  bear a
      notation in form  approved  by the Trustee as to any action  taken by such
      Act of Holders.  If the Company shall so determine,  new Securities of any
      series so modified  as to  conform,  in the opinion of the Trustee and the
      Company,  to such action may be prepared  and  executed by the Company and
      authenticated  and  delivered by the Trustee in exchange  for  Outstanding
      Securities of such series.

               (g) If the  Company  shall  solicit  from  Holders  any  request,
      demand,  authorization,  direction,  notice, consent, waiver or other Act,
      the  Company  may,  at its  option,  fix in advance a record  date for the
      determination   of  Holders   entitled  to  give  such  request,   demand,
      authorization,  direction,  notice,  consent, waiver or other Act, but the
      Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed,
      such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
      other Act may be given  before or after  such  record  date,  but only the
      Holders of record at the close of  business  on the  record  date shall be
      deemed to be Holders for the purposes of  determining  whether  Holders of
      the requisite proportion of the Outstanding  Securities have authorized or
      agreed or consented to such  request,  demand,  authorization,  direction,
      notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding
      Securities shall be computed as of the record date.

been made, given,  furnished and filed if personally  delivered,  on the date of

SECTION 106.  Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver.

               Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,   where  this
Indenture  provides  for notice to Holders of any event,  such  notice  shall be
sufficiently  given,  and shall be deemed  given,  to Holders if in writing  and
mailed,  first-class  postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at
the address of such  Holder as it appears in the  Security  Register,  not later
than the latest date,  if any, and not earlier than the earliest  date,  if any,
prescribed for the giving of such notice.

               In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by
reason  of any other  cause it shall be  impracticable  to give  such  notice to
Holders by mail,  then such  notification  as shall be made with the approval of
the  Trustee  shall  constitute  a  sufficient  notification  for every  purpose
hereunder.  In any case where  notice to Holders is given by mail,  neither  the
failure to mail such  notice,  nor any  defect in any  notice so mailed,  to any
particular  Holder shall affect the  sufficiency  of such notice with respect to
other Holders.

               Any notice required by this Indenture may be waived in writing by
the Person  entitled to receive  such notice,  either  before or after the event
otherwise to be specified  therein,  and such waiver shall be the  equivalent of
such notice.  Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee,  but
such filing  shall not be a condition  precedent  to the  validity of any action
taken in reliance upon such waiver.

SECTION 107.  Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

               If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts
with another provision hereof which is required or deemed to be included in this
Indenture  by, or is otherwise  governed by, any of the  provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act, such other provision shall control;  and if any provision  hereof
otherwise  conflicts with the Trust Indenture Act, the Trust Indenture Act shall
control.

SECTION 108.  Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

               The Article and Section  headings in this Indenture and the Table
of  Contents  are for  convenience  only and shall not affect  the  construction
hereof.

SECTION 109.  Successors and Assigns.

               All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company and
Trustee shall bind their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed
or not.

SECTION 110.  Separability Clause.

               In case any provision in this Indenture or the  Securities  shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,  the validity, legality and enforceability
of the  remaining  provisions  shall  not in any  way be  affected  or  impaired
thereby.

SECTION 111.  Benefits of Indenture.

               Nothing in this Indenture or the Securities,  express or implied,
shall  give to any  Person,  other than the  parties  hereto,  their  successors
hereunder,  the Holders  and, so long as the notice  described  in Section  1513
hereof has not been given,  the holders of Senior  Indebtedness,  any benefit or
any legal or equitable  right,  remedy or claim under this Indenture;  provided,
however, if the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights with respect to the
Securities or the related Trust Agreement,  a holder of Preferred Securities may
institute  a legal  proceeding  directly  against  the  Company to  enforce  the
Property  Trustee's  rights  with  respect  to  the  Securities  or  such  Trust
Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without first instituting any
legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other person or entity.

SECTION 112.  Governing Law.

               This  Indenture  and the  Securities  shall  be  governed  by and
construed in  accordance  with the laws of the State of New York,  except to the
extent that the law of any other jurisdiction shall be mandatorily applicable.

SECTION 113.  Legal Holidays.

               In any case where any Interest  Payment Date,  Redemption Date or
Stated  Maturity  of any  Security  shall not be a Business  Day at any Place of
Payment,  then  (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the
Securities  other than a provision in Securities of any series,  or in the Board
Resolution  or  Officer's   Certificate  which  establishes  the  terms  of  the
Securities of such series,  which specifically  states that such provision shall
apply in lieu of this Section) payment of interest or principal and premium,  if
any, need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date,  but may be made on
the next succeeding  Business Day at such Place of Payment,  except that if such
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made
on the immediately  preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and
effect,  and in the same  amount,  as if made on the  Interest  Payment  Date or
Redemption  Date,  or at the Stated  Maturity,  as the case may be, and, if such
payment is made or duly  provided for on such  Business  Day, no interest  shall
accrue on the amount so  payable  for the  period  from and after such  Interest
Payment Date,  Redemption Date or Stated  Maturity,  as the case may be, to such
Business Day.

SECTION 302.  Denominations.

               Unless  otherwise  provided as  contemplated  by Section 301 with

SECTION 303.  Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.

               Unless  otherwise  provided as  contemplated  by Section 301 with
respect to any series of Securities,  the Securities shall be executed on behalf
of the Company by an Authorized  Officer and may have the corporate  seal of the
Company affixed thereto or reproduced  thereon  attested by any other Authorized
Officer or by the  Secretary  or an  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Company.  The
signature  of any or all of these  officers on the  Securities  may be manual or
facsimile.

               Securities   bearing  the  manual  or  facsimile   signatures  of
individuals  who  were  at the  time of  execution  Authorized  Officers  or the
Secretary  or an  Assistant  Secretary  of the Company  shall bind the  Company,
notwithstanding  that such  individuals  or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the  authentication  and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

               The  Trustee  shall  authenticate  and  deliver  Securities  of a
series,  for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance with
the Company Order referred to below, upon receipt by the Trustee of:

               (a) the instrument or instruments  establishing the form or forms
      and terms of such series, as provided in Sections 201 and 301;

               (b) a Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery of
      such Securities and, to the extent that the terms of such Securities shall
      not have been  established  in an  indenture  supplemental  hereto or in a
      Board  Resolution,   or  in  an  Officer's   Certificate   pursuant  to  a
      supplemental  indenture  or  Board  Resolution,  all  as  contemplated  by
      Sections 201 and 301, establishing such terms;

               (c) the  Securities  of such  series,  executed  on behalf of the
      Company by an Authorized Officer;

               (d) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:

                     (i) the form or forms of such  Securities  have  been  duly
                  authorized  by  the  Company  and  have  been  established  in
                  conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

<PAGE>
                                       -19-

                     (ii) the terms of such Securities have been duly authorized
                  by the Company and have been  established  in conformity  with
                  the provisions of this Indenture; and

                     (iii) such Securities,  when authenticated and delivered by
                  the  Trustee  and issued and  delivered  by the Company in the
                  manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion
                  of Counsel,  will have been duly issued  under this  Indenture
                  and will constitute  valid and legally binding  obligations of
                  the  Company,  entitled  to  the  benefits  provided  by  this
                  Indenture,  and  enforceable  in accordance  with their terms,
                  subject,  as to enforcement,  to laws relating to or affecting
                  generally the  enforcement  of creditors'  rights,  including,
                  without  limitation,  bankruptcy  and  insolvency  laws and to
                  general  principles  of equity  (regardless  of  whether  such
                  enforceability  is  considered in a proceeding in equity or at
                  law).

               If the form or terms of the  Securities  of any series  have been
established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or an Officer's  Certificate as
permitted  by  Sections  201 or  301,  the  Trustee  shall  not be  required  to
authenticate such Securities if the issuance of such Securities pursuant to this
Indenture will materially or adversely  affect the Trustee's own rights,  duties
or immunities  under the  Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner
which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to any series of  Securities,  each Security  shall be dated the date of
its authentication.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect  to any series of  Securities,  no  Security  shall be  entitled  to any
benefit under this  Indenture or be valid or obligatory  for any purpose  unless
there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication  substantially in
the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating  Agent
by manual signature,  and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive
evidence, and the only evidence,  that such Security has been duly authenticated
and  delivered  hereunder  and is  entitled to the  benefits of this  Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and
delivered  hereunder to the  Company,  or any Person  acting on its behalf,  but
shall never have been  issued and sold by the  Company,  and the  Company  shall
deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309
together  with a written  statement  (which need not comply with Section 102 and
need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has
never been issued and sold by the Company,  for all  purposes of this  Indenture
such  Security  shall be deemed never to have been  authenticated  and delivered
hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits hereof.

SECTION 304.  Temporary Securities.

               Pending the  preparation of definitive  Securities of any series,
the Company may execute,  and upon Company Order the Trustee shall  authenticate
and deliver, temporary

<PAGE>
                                       -20-

Securities  which  are  printed,  lithographed,   typewritten,  mimeographed  or
otherwise produced, in any authorized  denomination,  substantially of the tenor
of the  definitive  Securities  in lieu of which  they  are  issued,  with  such
appropriate  insertions,  omissions,  substitutions  and other variations as the
officers  executing  such  Securities  may  determine,  as  evidenced  by  their
execution of such Securities;  provided, however, that temporary Securities need
not recite specific redemption, sinking fund, conversion or exchange provisions.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities of any series,  after the  preparation  of definitive
Securities  of such series,  the  temporary  Securities  of such series shall be
exchangeable, without charge to the Holder thereof, for definitive Securities of
such series upon surrender of such temporary  Securities at the office or agency
of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such
Securities.  Upon such surrender of temporary Securities for such exchange,  the
Company shall,  except as aforesaid,  execute and the Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver in exchange  therefor  definitive  Securities of the same series, of
authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.

               Until  exchanged in full as hereinabove  provided,  the temporary
Securities  of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this  Indenture as  definitive  Securities  of the same series and of like
tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder.

SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.

               The  Company  shall  cause to be kept in each  office  designated
pursuant to Section  602,  with  respect to the  Securities  of each  series,  a
register (all registers kept in accordance with this Section being  collectively
referred to as the  "Security  Register") in which,  subject to such  reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe,  the Company shall provide for the registration
of  Securities  of such series and the  registration  of transfer  thereof.  The
Company  shall  designate  one Person to maintain the Security  Register for the
Securities of each series on a consolidated  basis,  and such Person is referred
to herein,  with respect to such series, as the "Security  Registrar."  Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may designate one or more of
its offices as an office in which a register  with respect to the  Securities of
one or more series shall be maintained, and the Company may designate itself the
Security  Registrar  with  respect to one or more of such  series.  The Security
Register  shall be open for  inspection  by the  Trustee  and the Company at all
reasonable times.

               Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities of any series,  upon  surrender for  registration  of
transfer  of any  Security of such series at the office or agency of the Company
maintained  pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such  series,  the
Company shall execute,  and the Trustee shall  authenticate and deliver,  in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees,  one or more new Securities of
the same series,  of  authorized  denominations  and of like tenor and aggregate
principal amount.

<PAGE>
                                       -21-

               Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities  of any  series,  any  Security of such series may be
exchanged  at the option of the Holder,  for one or more new  Securities  of the
same  series,  of  authorized  denominations  and of like  tenor  and  aggregate
principal  amount,  upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such
office or agency.  Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange,  the
Company shall  execute,  and the Trustee  shall  authenticate  and deliver,  the
Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

               All  Securities  delivered upon any  registration  of transfer or
exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the
same debt,  and  entitled  to the same  benefits  under this  Indenture,  as the
Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

               Every  Security  presented or  surrendered  for  registration  of
transfer or for exchange  shall (if so required by the  Company,  the Trustee or
the Security  Registrar) be duly endorsed or shall be  accompanied  by a written
instrument of transfer in form  satisfactory to the Company,  the Trustee or the
Security  Registrar,  as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to  Securities  of any series,  no service  charge shall be made for any
registration of transfer or exchange of Securities,  but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge that
may be imposed in connection  with any  registration  of transfer or exchange of
Securities,  other  than  exchanges  pursuant  to Section  304,  406 or 1206 not
involving any transfer.

               The  Company  shall not be  required to execute or to provide for
the  registration of transfer of or the exchange of (a) Securities of any series
during a period of 15 days immediately  preceding the date of the mailing of any
notice  of  redemption  of such  Securities  called  for  redemption  or (b) any
Security so selected for  redemption in whole or in part,  except the unredeemed
portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.

               If any  mutilated  Security is  surrendered  to the Trustee,  the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a new  Security  of the same  series,  and of like tenor and  principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

               If there  shall be  delivered  to the Company and the Trustee (a)
evidence to their satisfaction of the ownership of and the destruction,  loss or
theft of any  Security and (b) such  security or indemnity as may be  reasonably
required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them  harmless,
then,  in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security
is held by a Person  purporting  to be the owner of such  Security,  the Company
shall execute and the Trustee  shall  authenticate  and deliver,  in lieu of any
such

<PAGE>
                                       -22-

destroyed,  lost or stolen Security,  a new Security of the same series,  and of
like  tenor and  principal  amount and  bearing a number  not  contemporaneously
outstanding.

               Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  case  any  such  mutilated,
destroyed,  lost or stolen  Security  has  become or is about to become  due and
payable,  the Company in its discretion may,  instead of issuing a new Security,
pay such Security.

               Upon the issuance of any new  Security  under this  Section,  the
Company may require  the payment of a sum  sufficient  to cover any tax or other
governmental  charge  that may be  imposed  in  relation  thereto  and any other
reasonable  expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
therewith.

               Every new Security of any series issued  pursuant to this Section
in lieu of any destroyed,  lost or stolen Security shall  constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Company,  whether or not the destroyed,
lost or stolen  Security  shall be at any time  enforceable by anyone other than
the Holder of such new Security,  and any such new Security shall be entitled to
all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately  with any and all
other Securities of such series duly issued hereunder.

               The  provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall  preclude
(to the  extent  lawful)  all other  rights  and  remedies  with  respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

SECTION 307.  Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities  of any  series,  interest on any  Security  which is
payable,  and is punctually  paid or duly provided for, on any Interest  Payment
Date  shall be paid to the Person in whose  name that  Security  (or one or more
Predecessor  Securities)  is  registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest.

               Subject to Section  311,  any  interest  on any  Security  of any
series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any
Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease
to be payable  to the Holder on the  related  Regular  Record  Date by virtue of
having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company,
at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:

               (a) The  Company  may  elect  to make  payment  of any  Defaulted
      Interest to the Persons in whose names the  Securities  of such series (or
      their  respective  Predecessor  Securities) are registered at the close of
      business on a date (herein called a "Special Record Date") for the payment
      of such Defaulted Interest,  which shall be fixed in the following manner.
      The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted
      Interest  proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date
      of the proposed  payment,  and at the same time the Company  shall deposit
      with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed
      to be paid in

<PAGE>
                                       -23- 

      respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory
      to the  Trustee for such  deposit on or prior to the date of the  proposed
      payment,  such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of
      the  Persons  entitled  to  such  Defaulted  Interest  as in  this  clause
      provided.  Thereupon the Trustee  shall fix a Special  Record Date for the
      payment of such  Defaulted  Interest  which shall be not more than 15 days
      and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the  proposed  payment  and
      not less than 10 days after the  receipt  by the  Trustee of the notice of
      the proposed  payment.  The Trustee shall  promptly  notify the Company of
      such  Special  Record  Date  and,  in the name and at the  expense  of the
      Company,  shall  promptly  cause  notice of the  proposed  payment of such
      Defaulted  Interest  and the Special  Record  Date  therefor to be mailed,
      first-class  postage prepaid,  to each Holder of Securities of such series
      at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register,  not
      less  than 10 days  prior  to such  Special  Record  Date.  Notice  of the
      proposed  payment of such  Defaulted  Interest and the Special Record Date
      therefor having been so mailed,  such Defaulted  Interest shall be paid to
      the  Persons  in whose  names  the  Securities  of such  series  (or their
      respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business
      on such Special Record Date.

               (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
      Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent  with
      the  requirements of any securities  exchange on which such Securities may
      be listed,  and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange,  if,
      after notice  given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed  payment
      pursuant  to  this  clause,   such  manner  of  payment  shall  be  deemed
      practicable by the Trustee.

               Subject to the  foregoing  provisions of this Section and Section
305, each Security  delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer
of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to
interest  accrued and unpaid,  and to accrue,  which were  carried by such other
Security.

SECTION 308.  Persons Deemed Owners.

               Prior  to due  presentment  of a  Security  for  registration  of
transfer,  the Company,  the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name such  Security is  registered as the absolute
owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving  payment of principal of and
premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such
Security and for all other purposes whatsoever,  whether or not such Security be
overdue,  and neither the  Company,  the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or
the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 309.  Cancellation by Security Registrar.

               All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption,  registration
of transfer or  exchange  shall,  if  surrendered  to any Person  other than the
Security  Registrar,  be  delivered  to  the  Security  Registrar  and,  if  not
theretofore canceled, shall be promptly canceled by the

<PAGE>
                                       -24-

Security  Registrar.  The Company may at any time  deliver to the  Security
Registrar for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered
hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner  whatsoever or which
the Company  shall not have issued and sold,  and all  Securities  so  delivered
shall be promptly  canceled by the Security  Registrar.  No Securities  shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities  canceled as provided
in this Section,  except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.  All canceled
Securities  held by the Security  Registrar  shall be disposed of in  accordance
with a Company Order  delivered to the Security  Registrar and the Trustee,  and
the Security  Registrar  shall promptly  deliver a certificate of disposition to
the Trustee and the Company unless, by a Company Order, similarly delivered, the
Company  shall direct that  canceled  Securities be returned to it. The Security
Registrar shall promptly  deliver  evidence of any cancellation of a Security in
accordance with this Section 309 to the Trustee and the Company.

SECTION 310.  Computation of Interest.

               Except as otherwise  specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities  of any series,  interest on the  Securities  of each series shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year  consisting  of twelve 30-day months and
for any period  shorter than a full month,  on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed in such period.

SECTION 311.  Extension of Interest Payment.

               The  Company  shall  have the right at any  time,  so long as the
Company is not in default in the payment of interest  on the  Securities  of any
series hereunder, to extend interest payment periods on all Securities of one or
more series, if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such
Securities  and upon such terms as may be specified as  contemplated  by Section
301 with respect to such Securities.

SECTION 312. Additional Interest.

               So long as any Preferred  Securities remain  outstanding,  if the
Trust which  issued such  Preferred  Securities  shall be required to pay,  with
respect to its income  derived from the interest  payments on the  Securities of
any series, any amounts for or on account of any taxes,  duties,  assessments or
governmental  charges of whatever  nature imposed by the United  States,  or any
other taxing authority, then, in any such case, the Company will pay as interest
on such  series  such  additional  interest  ("Additional  Interest")  as may be
necessary  in order that the net  amounts  received  and  retained by such Trust
after the payment of such taxes,  duties,  assessments or  governmental  charges
shall  result in such  Trust's  having  such  funds as it would  have had in the
absence of the  payment  of such  taxes,  duties,  assessments  or  governmental
charges.

                                  ARTICLE FOUR

                            Redemption of Securities

SECTION 401.  Applicability of Article.

               Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated
Maturity  shall be  redeemable  in  accordance  with their  terms and (except as
otherwise  specified  as  contemplated  by Section  301 for  Securities  of such
series) in accordance with this Article.

SECTION 402.  Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

               The  election  of the Company to redeem any  Securities  shall be
evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate.  The Company shall,
at least 45 days prior to the  Redemption  Date fixed by the  Company  (unless a
shorter  notice shall be  satisfactory  to the  Trustee),  notify the Trustee in
writing of such Redemption  Date and of the principal  amount of such Securities
to be redeemed.  In the case of any  redemption of  Securities  (a) prior to the
expiration of any restriction on such  redemption  provided in the terms of such
Securities or elsewhere in this  Indenture or (b) pursuant to an election of the
Company  which  is  subject  to a  condition  specified  in the  terms  of  such
Securities,  the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate
evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.

SECTION 403.  Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.

               If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed,
the  particular  Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from
the Outstanding  Securities of such series not previously called for redemption,
by such  method  as shall be  provided  for any  particular  series,  or, in the
absence of any such provision, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate  and which may provide for the selection for  redemption of portions
(equal to the minimum  authorized  denomination for Securities of such series or
any integral  multiple  thereof) of the  principal  amount of Securities of such
series of a denomination  larger than the minimum  authorized  denomination  for
Securities  of such  series;  provided,  however,  that if, as  indicated  in an
Officer's  Certificate,  the Company  shall have  offered to purchase all or any
principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding of any series, and less than
all of such  Securities as to which such offer was made shall have been tendered
to the Company for such purchase,  the Trustee, if so directed by Company Order,
shall select for redemption all or any principal amount of such Securities which
have not been so tendered.

               The Trustee  shall  promptly  notify the Company and the Security
Registrar in writing of the Securities  selected for redemption and, in the case
of any Securities  selected to be redeemed in part, the principal amount thereof
to be redeemed.

               For all purposes of this Indenture,  unless the context otherwise
requires,  all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate,
in the case of any Securities
<PAGE>
                                       -26-

redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal  amount
of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.

SECTION 404.  Notice of Redemption.

               Notice of  redemption  shall be given in the manner  provided  in
Section 106 to the Holders of the Securities to be redeemed not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.

               All notices of redemption shall state:

               (a) the Redemption Date,

               (b) the Redemption Price,

               (c) if less  than  all the  Securities  of any  series  are to be
      redeemed,  the identification of the particular  Securities to be redeemed
      and the portion of the principal  amount of any Security to be redeemed in
      part,

               (d) that on the Redemption  Date the Redemption  Price,  together
      with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, will become due and
      payable upon each such  Security to be redeemed and, if  applicable,  that
      interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,

               (e)  the  place  or  places  where  such  Securities  are  to  be
      surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued  interest,  if
      any,  unless it shall have been specified as  contemplated  by Section 301
      with respect to such Securities that such surrender shall not be required,

               (f) that the  redemption  is for a sinking or other fund, if such
      is the case, and

               (g) such other  matters as the Company  shall deem  desirable  or
      appropriate.

               Unless  otherwise  specified  with respect to any  Securities  in
accordance  with  Section  301,  with  respect  to any notice of  redemption  of
Securities  at the  election  of the  Company,  unless,  upon the giving of such
notice,  such  Securities  shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance  with
Section 701,  such notice may state that such  redemption  shall be  conditional
upon the receipt by the Paying Agent or Agents for such Securities,  on or prior
to the date fixed for such redemption,  of money sufficient to pay the principal
of and premium,  if any, and interest,  if any, on such  Securities  and that if
such money shall not have been so received  such notice  shall be of no force or
effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such  Securities.  In the
event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is
not so received,  the redemption  shall not be made and within a reasonable time
thereafter  notice  shall be  given,  in the  manner  in  which  the  notice  of
redemption  was given,  that such money was not so received and such  redemption
was not

<PAGE>
                                       -27-

required to be made, and the Paying Agent or Agents for the Securities otherwise
to have been redeemed shall promptly  return to the Holders  thereof any of such
Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.

               Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election
of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of a condition for redemption
as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Security  Registrar  in the name and at the  expense of the  Company.  Notice of
mandatory  redemption of Securities shall be given by the Security  Registrar in
the name and at the expense of the Company.

SECTION 405.  Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

               Notice of  redemption  having  been given as  aforesaid,  and the
conditions,  if any,  set  forth  in such  notice  having  been  satisfied,  the
Securities or portions  thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date,
become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein  specified,  and from and
after such date (unless,  in the case of an unconditional  notice of redemption,
the Company  shall  default in the payment of the  Redemption  Price and accrued
interest,  if any) such  Securities or portions  thereof,  if  interest-bearing,
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption
in accordance  with such notice,  such Security or portion thereof shall be paid
by the Company at the Redemption Price,  together with accrued interest, if any,
to the Redemption  Date;  provided,  however,  that no such surrender shall be a
condition to such payment if so  specified as  contemplated  by Section 301 with
respect to such  Security;  and  provided,  further,  that  except as  otherwise
specified  as  contemplated  by Section 301 with respect to such  Security,  any
installment of interest on any Security the Stated Maturity of which installment
is on or prior to the  Redemption  Date  shall be  payable to the Holder of such
Security, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close
of business on the related  Regular  Record Date  according to the terms of such
Security and subject to the provisions of Section 307.

SECTION 406.  Securities Redeemed in Part.

               Upon the  surrender of any Security  which is to be redeemed only
in part at a Place of Payment  therefor  (with, if the Company or the Trustee so
requires,  due  endorsement  by, or a written  instrument  of  transfer  in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof
or his attorney duly authorized in writing),  the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall  authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security,  without
service  charge,  a new  Security  or  Securities  of the  same  series,  of any
authorized  denomination  requested  by such  Holder  and of like  tenor  and in
aggregate  principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed  portion
of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

                                  ARTICLE FIVE

                                  Sinking Funds

SECTION 501. Applicability of Article.

               The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking
fund for the  retirement of the  Securities  of any series,  except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

               The minimum  amount of any sinking fund  payment  provided for by
the terms of  Securities  of any series is herein  referred  to as a  "mandatory
sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided
for by the  terms of  Securities  of any  series  is  herein  referred  to as an
"optional  sinking fund payment".  If provided for by the terms of Securities of
any  series,  the cash  amount of any  sinking  fund  payment  may be subject to
reduction as provided in Section 502. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied
to the redemption of Securities of the series in respect of which it was made as
provided for by the terms of such Securities.

SECTION 502.  Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.

               The Company (a) may deliver to the Trustee Outstanding Securities
(other  than any  previously  called for  redemption)  of a series in respect of
which a  mandatory  sinking  fund  payment  is to be made and (b) may apply as a
credit Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election
of the  Company  pursuant  to the  terms  of  such  Securities  or  through  the
application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of
such Securities or Outstanding Securities purchased by the Company, in each case
in satisfaction  of all or any part of such mandatory  sinking fund payment with
respect to the Securities of such series; provided,  however, that no Securities
shall be applied in  satisfaction  of a mandatory  sinking  fund payment if such
Securities shall have been previously so applied. Securities so applied shall be
received and credited  for such purpose by the Trustee at the  Redemption  Price
specified in such  Securities  for redemption  through  operation of the sinking
fund and the amount of such  mandatory  sinking  fund  payment  shall be reduced
accordingly.

SECTION 503.  Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.

               Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for
the  Securities  of any  series,  the  Company  shall  deliver to the Trustee an
Officer's Certificate specifying:

               (a) the  amount of the next  succeeding  mandatory  sinking  fund
      payment for such series;

               (b) the amount,  if any, of the optional  sinking fund payment to
      be made together with such mandatory sinking fund payment;

<PAGE>
                                       -29-

               (c) the aggregate sinking fund payment;

               (d) the portion,  if any, of such aggregate  sinking fund payment
      which is to be satisfied by the payment of cash;

               (e) the portion,  if any, of such aggregate  sinking fund payment
      which is to be satisfied by delivering  and  crediting  Securities of such
      series  pursuant  to Section 502 and stating the basis for such credit and
      that such Securities have not previously been so credited, and the Company
      shall also deliver to the Trustee any  Securities to be so  delivered.  If
      the  Company  shall  not  deliver  such  Officer's  Certificate,  the next
      succeeding  sinking fund payment for such series shall be made entirely in
      cash in the amount of the mandatory sinking fund payment. Not less than 30
      days before each such sinking  fund payment date the Trustee  shall select
      the  Securities  to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the
      manner specified in Section 403 and cause notice of the redemption thereof
      to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner
      provided  in  Section  404.  Such  notice  having  been  duly  given,  the
      redemption  of such  Securities  shall be made  upon the  terms and in the
      manner stated in Sections 405 and 406.


                                   ARTICLE SIX

                                    Covenants

SECTION 601.  Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.

               The Company shall pay the  principal of and premium,  if any, and
interest,  if any  (including  Additional  Interest),  on the Securities of each
series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.

SECTION 602.  Maintenance of Office or Agency.

               The  Company  shall  maintain  in each Place of  Payment  for the
Securities of each series an office or agency where  payment of such  Securities
shall be made, where the registration of transfer or exchange of such Securities
may be effected and where  notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect
of such  Securities  and this  Indenture  may be served.  The Company shall give
prompt  written  notice to the  Trustee of the  location,  and any change in the
location,  of each such office or agency and prompt notice to the Holders of any
such change in the manner  specified  in Section 106. If at any time the Company
shall  fail to  maintain  any such  required  office  or agency  in  respect  of
Securities of any series,  or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address
thereof,  payment of such Securities shall be made,  registration of transfer or
exchange  thereof may be effected and notices and demands in respect thereof may
be served at the Corporate  Trust Office of the Trustee,  and the Company hereby
appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes in any such event.

                                       -30-

               The  Company  may also  from time to time  designate  one or more
other offices or agencies with respect to the  Securities of one or more series,
for any or all of the foregoing  purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations;   provided,   however,   that,   unless  otherwise   specified  as
contemplated  by Section 301 with respect to the  Securities of such series,  no
such  designation  or rescission  shall in any manner relieve the Company of its
obligation  to maintain  an office or agency for such  purposes in each Place of
Payment for such Securities in accordance with the requirements set forth above.
The Company shall give prompt written  notice to the Trustee,  and prompt notice
to the Holders in the manner  specified in Section 106, of any such  designation
or  rescission  and of any change in the  location  of any such other  office or
agency.

               Anything  herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,  any office or
agency  required by this Section may be  maintained at an office of the Company,
in which event the Company  shall  perform all functions to be performed at such
office or agency.

SECTION 603.  Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.

               If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with
respect to the Securities of any series, it shall, on or before each due date of
the  principal of and  premium,  if any,  and  interest,  if any, on any of such
Securities,  segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto a sum  sufficient  to pay the  principal  and  premium  or  interest  so
becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein  provided.  The Company  shall  promptly  notify the Trustee of any
failure by the Company  (or any other  obligor on such  Securities)  to make any
payment of  principal  of or  premium,  if any,  or  interest,  if any,  on such
Securities.

               Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for the
Securities of any series,  it shall, on or before each due date of the principal
of and premium, if any, and interest,  if any, on such Securities,  deposit with
such Paying Agents sums  sufficient  (without  duplication) to pay the principal
and premium or interest  so becoming  due,  such sum to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Persons  entitled to such  principal,  premium or  interest,  and
(unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company shall promptly  notify the
Trustee of any failure by it so to act.

               The Company  shall cause each Paying Agent for the  Securities of
any series, other than the Company or the Trustee, to execute and deliver to the
Trustee an  instrument  in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee,
subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent shall:

               (a) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the  principal of
      and premium, if any, or interest,  if any, on such Securities in trust for
      the benefit of the Persons  entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
      to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

<PAGE>
                                       -31-

               (b) give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or any
      other obligor upon such Securities) to make any payment of principal of or
      premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Securities; and

               (c) at any time during the continuance of any such default,  upon
      the written request of the Trustee,  forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums
      so held in trust by such  Paying  Agent and  furnish to the  Trustee  such
      information  as it  possesses  regarding  the names and  addresses  of the
      Persons entitled to such sums.

               The Company may at any time pay, or by Company  Order  direct any
Paying  Agent to pay,  to the  Trustee  all sums held in trust by the Company or
such Paying  Agent,  such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as
those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent and, if
so stated in a Company Order  delivered to the Trustee,  in accordance  with the
provisions of Article  Seven;  and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Trustee,  such Paying Agent shall be released  from all further  liability  with
respect to such money.

               Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then
held by the Company,  in trust for the payment of the  principal of and premium,
if any, or interest,  if any, on any Security and  remaining  unclaimed  for two
years after such  principal and premium,  if any, or interest has become due and
payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or, if then held by the
Company,  shall be  discharged  from  such  trust;  and,  upon such  payment  or
discharge,  the Holder of such Security shall, as an unsecured  general creditor
and not as a Holder of an  Outstanding  Security,  look only to the  Company for
payment of the amount so due and payable and remaining unpaid, and all liability
of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with  respect to such trust  money,  and all
liability of the Company as trustee thereof,  shall thereupon  cease;  provided,
however,  that the Trustee or such Paying Agent,  before being  required to make
any such payment to the Company,  may at the expense of the Company  cause to be
mailed,  on one  occasion  only,  notice to such Holder that such money  remains
unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than
30 days from the date of such mailing,  any unclaimed balance of such money then
remaining will be paid to the Company.

SECTION 604.  Corporate Existence.

               Subject to the rights of the Company  under Article  Eleven,  the
Company  shall do or cause to be done all things  necessary to preserve and keep
in full force and effect its corporate existence.

SECTION 605.  Maintenance of Properties.

               The Company  shall cause (or,  with respect to property  owned in
common with others,  make reasonable effort to cause) all its properties used or
useful  in the  conduct  of its  business  to be  maintained  and  kept  in good
condition,  repair  and  working  order and shall  cause  (or,  with  respect to
property owned in common with others, make reasonable effort to

<PAGE>
                                       -32-

cause) to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and
improvements  thereof,  all as, in the judgment of the Company, may be necessary
so  that  the  business  carried  on in  connection  therewith  may be  properly
conducted;  provided,  however,  that nothing in this Section  shall prevent the
Company from discontinuing,  or causing the discontinuance of, the operation and
maintenance of any of its properties if such  discontinuance is, in the judgment
of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business.

SECTION 606.  Annual Officer's Certificate as to Compliance.

               Not later than  September 15 in each year,  commencing  September
15, 1996,  the Company  shall  deliver to the Trustee an  Officer's  Certificate
which need not comply with  Section  102,  executed by the  principal  executive
officer,  the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer of
the Company, as to such officer's knowledge of the Company's compliance with all
conditions and covenants under this Indenture,  such compliance to be determined
without  regard to any  period of grace or  requirement  of  notice  under  this
Indenture.

SECTION 607.  Waiver of Certain Covenants.

               The  Company may omit in any  particular  instance to comply with
any term,  provision or condition set forth in (a) Section 602 or any additional
covenant or restriction  specified with respect to the Securities of any series,
as  contemplated  by Section  301,  if before the time for such  compliance  the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate  principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities  of all series with respect to which  compliance  with Section 602 or
such  additional  covenant or  restriction  is to be omitted,  considered as one
class,  shall,  by Act of such  Holders,  either waive such  compliance  in such
instance or generally waive  compliance  with such term,  provision or condition
and (b)  Section  604,  605 or  Article  Eleven  if  before  the  time  for such
compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal  amount of Securities
Outstanding  under this Indenture  shall,  by Act of such Holders,  either waive
such compliance in such instance or generally  waive  compliance with such term,
provision  or  condition;  but, in the case of (a) or (b), no such waiver  shall
extend to or affect such term,  provision or  condition  except to the extent so
expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations
of the  Company  and the  duties of the  Trustee  in  respect  of any such term,
provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however,
so long as a Trust  holds  Securities  of any  series,  such Trust may not waive
compliance  or waive any default in  compliance by the Company with any covenant
or other term  contained  in this  Indenture  or the  Securities  of such series
without  the  approval  of the  holders  of at  least a  majority  in  aggregate
liquidation  preference of the outstanding  Preferred  Securities issued by such
Trust affected,  obtained as provided in the Trust Agreement  pertaining to such
Trust.

SECTION 608.  Restriction on Payment of Dividends.

               So  long  as  any  Preferred  Securities  of  any  series  remain
outstanding,  the Company  shall not declare or pay any  dividend on, or redeem,
purchase, acquire or make a

<PAGE>
                                       -33-

liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock, or make
any guarantee  payments with respect to the foregoing (other than payments under
the Guarantee  relating to such  Preferred  Securities)  if at such time (a) the
Company  shall be in default  with  respect to its payment or other  obligations
under the Guarantee relating to such Preferred Securities,  (b) there shall have
occurred and be continuing a payment default (whether before or after expiration
of any  period of grace) or an Event of  Default  hereunder  or (c) the  Company
shall have elected to extend any interest  payment period as provided in Section
311, and any such period, or any extension thereof, shall be continuing.

SECTION 609.  Maintenance of Trust Existence.

               So long as Preferred Securities of any series remain outstanding,
the Company shall (i) maintain direct or indirect  ownership of all interests in
the Trust which  issued such  Preferred  Securities,  other than such  Preferred
Securities,  (ii) not  voluntarily  (to the extent  permitted by law)  dissolve,
liquidate or wind up such Trust, except in connection with a distribution of the
Securities to the holders of the Preferred  Securities  in  liquidation  of such
Trust,   (iii)  remain  the  sole  Depositor  under  the  Trust  Agreement  (the
"Depositor")  of such Trust and timely  perform in all material  respects all of
its duties as Depositor of such Trust, and (iv) use reasonable  efforts to cause
such Trust to remain a business trust and otherwise  continue to be treated as a
grantor  trust for  Federal  income tax  purposes  provided  that any  permitted
successor  to the Company  under this  Indenture  may  succeed to the  Company's
duties as  Depositor of such Trust;  and  provided  further that the Company may
permit such Trust to consolidate or merge with or into another business trust or
other permitted successor under the Trust Agreement  pertaining to such Trust so
long as the Company  agrees to comply with this Section 609 with respect to such
successor business trust or other permitted successor.

SECTION 610.  Rights of Holders of Preferred Securities.

               The Company agrees that, for so long as any Preferred  Securities
remain  outstanding,  its obligations  under this Indenture will also be for the
benefit  of the  holders  from  time to time of  Preferred  Securities,  and the
Company  acknowledges  and agrees that if the Property  Trustee fails to enforce
its rights with respect to the  Securities  or the related  Trust  Agreement,  a
holder of Preferred Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against
the  Company  to enforce  the  Property  Trustee's  rights  with  respect to the
Securities  or such Trust  Agreement,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by law,
without first  instituting any legal proceeding  against the Property Trustee or
any other person or entity.

                           Satisfaction and Discharge

SECTION 701.  Defeasance.

               Any  Security  or  Securities,  or any  portion of the  principal
amount  thereof,  shall be deemed to have  been  paid for all  purposes  of this
Indenture,  and the entire  indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof shall
be  deemed to have been  satisfied  and  discharged,  if there  shall  have been
irrevocably  deposited  with the  Trustee or any Paying  Agent  (other  than the
Company), in trust:

               (a) money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or

               (b) in the case of a deposit  made prior to the  Maturity of such
      Securities or portions thereof,  Government  Obligations,  which shall not
      contain  provisions  permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof
      at the option of the issuer thereof,  the principal of and the interest on
      which when due, without any regard to reinvestment  thereof,  will provide
      moneys which,  together with the money, if any,  deposited with or held by
      the Trustee or such Paying Agent, shall be sufficient, or

               (c) a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient,

to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest,  if any, due
and to  become  due on such  Securities  or  portions  thereof  on or  prior  to
Maturity;  provided,  however,  that in the case of the provision for payment or
redemption  of less than all the  Securities of any series,  such  Securities or
portions thereof shall have been selected by the Trustee as provided herein and,
in the case of a  redemption,  the  notice  requisite  to the  validity  of such
redemption shall have been given or irrevocable  authority shall have been given
by  the  Company  to  the  Trustee  to  give  such  notice,  under  arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided,  further, that the Company shall have
delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent:

                     (x) if such  deposit  shall  have  been  made  prior to the
                  Maturity of such Securities,  a Company Order stating that the
                  money and Government  Obligations deposited in accordance with
                  this  Section  shall be held in trust,  as provided in Section
                  703; and

                     (y) if Government Obligations shall have been deposited, an
                  Opinion  of  Counsel   that  the   obligations   so  deposited
                  constitute   Government   Obligations   and  do  not   contain
                  provisions  permitting the  redemption or other  prepayment at
                  the  option  of  the  issuer  thereof,  and an  opinion  of an
                  independent   public   accountant  of  nationally   recognized
                  standing,  selected  by the  Company,  to the effect  that the
                  requirements   set  forth  in  clause   (b)  above  have  been
                  satisfied; and

<PAGE>
                                       -35-

                     (z) if such  deposit  shall  have  been  made  prior to the
                  Maturity of such Securities,  an Officer's Certificate stating
                  the Company's  intention that, upon delivery of such Officer's
                  Certificate, its indebtedness in respect of such Securities or
                  portions  thereof will have been  satisfied and  discharged as
                  contemplated in this Section.

               Upon the deposit of money or Government Obligations,  or both, in
accordance  with this Section,  together with the documents  required by clauses
(x), (y) and (z) above,  the Trustee shall,  upon receipt of a Company  Request,
acknowledge in writing that the Security or Securities or portions  thereof with
respect  to which  such  deposit  was made are  deemed to have been paid for all
purposes of this  Indenture and that the entire  indebtedness  of the Company in
respect  thereof has been  satisfied  and  discharged  as  contemplated  in this
Section.  In the event  that all of the  conditions  set forth in the  preceding
paragraph  shall have been  satisfied in respect of any  Securities  or portions
thereof  except that,  for any reason,  the Officer's  Certificate  specified in
clause (z) shall not have been delivered,  such  Securities or portions  thereof
shall  nevertheless  be  deemed  to have  been  paid  for all  purposes  of this
Indenture,  and the  Holders  of  such  Securities  or  portions  thereof  shall
nevertheless  be no longer  entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or of any
of the  covenants  of the  Company  under  Article  Six  (except  the  covenants
contained  in Sections  602 and 603) or any other  covenants  made in respect of
such  Securities  or portions  thereof as  contemplated  by Section 301, but the
indebtedness  of the Company in respect of such  Securities or portions  thereof
shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged  prior to Maturity for
any other purpose,  and the Holders of such Securities or portions thereof shall
continue to be  entitled to look to the Company for payment of the  indebtedness
represented thereby; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall acknowledge in
writing that such  Securities  or portions  thereof are deemed to have been paid
for all purposes of this Indenture.

               If payment at Stated  Maturity of less than all of the Securities
of any series is to be provided  for in the manner and with the effect  provided
in this  Section,  the  Security  Registrar  shall  select such  Securities,  or
portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 403 for
selection for redemption of less than all the Securities of a series.

               In the event that  Securities  which shall be deemed to have been
paid for  purposes of this  Indenture,  and, if such is the case,  in respect of
which the Company's  indebtedness shall have been satisfied and discharged,  all
as provided in this Section do not mature and are not to be redeemed  within the
60 day period  commencing  with the date of the deposit of moneys or  Government
Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a
notice,  in the same  manner  as a notice of  redemption  with  respect  to such
Securities,  to the Holders of such  Securities  to the effect that such deposit
has been made and the effect thereof.

               Notwithstanding  that any Securities shall be deemed to have been
paid for  purposes of this  Indenture,  as  aforesaid,  the  obligations  of the
Company and the Trustee in respect of such  Securities  under Sections 304, 305,
306,  404,  503 (as to notice of  redemption),  602,  603,  907 and 915 and this
Article Seven shall survive.

               The Company  shall pay,  and shall  indemnify  the Trustee or any
Paying  Agent with which  Government  Obligations  shall have been  deposited as
provided in this Section  against,  any tax,  fee or other charge  imposed on or
assessed  against  such  Government  Obligations  or the  principal  or interest
received in respect of such Government Obligations,  including,  but not limited
to, any such tax payable by any entity  deemed,  for tax purposes,  to have been
created as a result of such deposit.

               Anything herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,  (a) if, at any
time after a  Security  would be deemed to have been paid for  purposes  of this
Indenture,  and,  if such is the case,  the  Company's  indebtedness  in respect
thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied or  discharged,  pursuant to this
Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any
Paying  Agent,  as the case may be,  shall be  required  to return  the money or
Government Obligations,  or combination thereof,  deposited with it as aforesaid
to the  Company  or its  representative  under any  applicable  Federal or State
bankruptcy,  insolvency or other similar law, such Security  shall  thereupon be
deemed retroactively not to have been paid and any satisfaction and discharge of
the Company's  indebtedness in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not
to have been effected,  and such Security shall be deemed to remain  Outstanding
and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's  indebtedness in respect
of any  Security  shall be subject to the  provisions  of the last  paragraph of
Section 603.

SECTION 702.  Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.

               This Indenture  shall upon Company Request cease to be of further
effect  (except as  hereinafter  expressly  provided),  and the Trustee,  at the
expense  of  the  Company,   shall  execute  proper  instruments   acknowledging
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when

               (a) no Securities remain Outstanding hereunder; and

               (b) the  Company  has paid or caused  to be paid all  other  sums
      payable hereunder by the Company;

provided,  however,  that if, in accordance  with the last  paragraph of Section
701,  any  Security,  previously  deemed to have been paid for  purposes of this
Indenture,  shall  be  deemed  retroactively  not to  have  been so  paid,  this
Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and
discharged,  as  aforesaid,  and to remain in full  force  and  effect,  and the
Company  shall  execute  and  deliver  such  instruments  as the  Trustee  shall
reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same.

               Notwithstanding  the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture
as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee under Sections 304,
305, 306, 404, 503 (as to notice of redemption),  602, 603, 907 and 915 and this
Article Seven shall survive.

paragraph  of Section 701 maturing at such times and in such amounts as shall be
sufficient to pay when due the  principal of and premium,  if any, and interest,
if any,  due and to become due on such  Securities  or  portions  thereof on and
prior to the Maturity thereof,  and interest earned from such reinvestment shall
be paid over to the Company as  received,  free and clear of any trust,  lien or
pledge  under this  Indenture  except the lien  provided  by  Section  907;  and
provided,  further,  that,  so long as  there  shall  not have  occurred  and be
continuing an Event of Default,  any moneys held in accordance with this Section
on the Maturity of all such  Securities in excess of the amount  required to pay

Securities  shall be paid over to the Company free and clear of any trust,  lien
or pledge  under this  Indenture  except the lien  provided by Section  907; and
provided,  further,  that if an Event of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing, moneys to be paid over to the Company pursuant to this Section shall
be held until such Event of Default shall have been waived or cured.

      provisions of Article Fifteen  hereof);  provided,  however,  that a valid
      extension of the interest payment period by the

       Company as contemplated in Section 311 of this  Indenture  shall  not  
       constitute  a  failure  to pay interest for this purpose; or

      this Indenture  solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities
      other  than  such  series)  for a period of 60 days  after  there has been
      given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee,  or

      Securities of such series not less than the principal amount of Securities
      the Holders of which gave such notice,  as the case may be, shall agree in
      writing to an extension of such period prior to its expiration;  provided,
      however,  that  the  Trustee,  or the  Trustee  and  the  Holders  of such
      principal  amount of Securities of such series,  as the case may be, shall
      be deemed to have  agreed to an  extension  of such  period if  corrective
      action  is  initiated  by the  Company  within  such  period  and is being
      diligently pursued; or

               (d) the entry by a court having  jurisdiction  in the premises of

      of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law,
      or  appointing  a  custodian,  receiver,  liquidator,  assignee,  trustee,
      sequestrator  or  other  similar  official  for  the  Company  or for  any
      substantial  part  of  its  property,   or  ordering  the  winding  up  or
      liquidation of its affairs, and any such decree or order for relief or any
      such other decree or order shall have remained  unstayed and in effect for
      a period of 90 consecutive days; or

               (e)  the  commencement  by the  Company  of a  voluntary  case or
      proceeding under any applicable  Federal or State bankruptcy,  insolvency,
      reorganization  or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to
      be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent,  or the consent by it to the entry
      of a decree or order for  relief in  respect  of the  Company in a case or
      proceeding under any applicable  Federal or State bankruptcy,  insolvency,

                                       -39-

      filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking  reorganization or
      relief under any applicable  Federal or State law, or the consent by it to

      by a custodian, receiver,  liquidator,  assignee, trustee, sequestrator or
      similar  official  of  the  Company  or of  any  substantial  part  of its
      property,  or  the  making  by it of an  assignment  for  the  benefit  of
      creditors,  or the  admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its
      debts generally as they become due, or the authorization of such action by
      the Board of Directors; or

               (f)  any  other  Event  of  Default  specified  with  respect  to
      Securities of such series.

SECTION 802.  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.

               If an Event of Default due to the default in payment of principal
of, or  interest  on,  any  series of  Securities  or due to the  default in the
performance  or  breach  of any  other  covenant  or  warranty  of  the  Company
applicable  to  the  Securities  of  such  series  but  not  applicable  to  all
outstanding Securities shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee
or the Holders of not less than 33% in  principal  amount of the  Securities  of
such series may then declare the principal of all  Securities of such series and
interest  accrued thereon to be due and payable  immediately  (provided that the
payment of principal and interest on such Securities  shall remain  subordinated
to the extent provided in Article Fifteen hereof). If an Event of Default due to
default in the  performance  of any other of the covenants or agreements  herein
applicable to all  Outstanding  Securities  or an Event of Default  specified in
Section 801(d) or (e) shall have occurred and be continuing,  either the Trustee
or the Holders of not less than 33% in principal  amount of all Securities  then
Outstanding  (considered as one class), and not the Holders of the Securities of
any one of such series, may declare the principal of all Securities and interest
accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately  (provided that the payment of
principal  and  interest on such  Securities  shall remain  subordinated  to the
extent provided in the Indenture).

               At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect
to Securities of any series shall have been made and before a judgment or decree
for  payment  of the money  due  shall  have been  obtained  by the  Trustee  as
hereinafter in this Article provided, the Event or Events of Default giving rise
to such  declaration of  acceleration  shall,  without further act, be deemed to
have been waived,  and such  declaration  and its  consequences  shall,  without
further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if

               (a) the Company  shall have paid or deposited  with the Trustee a
      sum sufficient to pay

                     (1) all overdue interest on all Securities of such series;

                     (2) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Securities
                  of such series  which have become due  otherwise  than by such
                  declaration of

<PAGE>
                                       -40- 

                   acceleration  and interest thereon at the rate or rates 
                   prescribed  therefor in such Securities;

                     (3) to the extent that payment of such  interest is lawful,
                  interest upon overdue  interest,  if any, at the rate or rates
                  prescribed therefor in such Securities;

                     (4) all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907;

               and

               (b) any  other  Event  or  Events  of  Default  with  respect  to
      Securities of such series,  other than the  nonpayment of the principal of
      Securities  of such  series  which  shall  have  become due solely by such
      declaration of  acceleration,  shall have been cured or waived as provided
      in Section 813.

No such  rescission  shall affect any subsequent  Event of Default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

SECTION 803.  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by 
              Trustee.

               If an Event of Default  described in clause (a) or (b) of Section
801 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the
Trustee,  pay to it, for the  benefit of the  Holders of the  Securities  of the
series  with  respect to which such Event of Default  shall have  occurred,  the
whole amount then due and payable on such  Securities for principal and premium,
if any, and interest,  if any, and, to the extent permitted by law,  interest on
premium, if any, and on any overdue principal and interest, at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Securities,  and, in addition thereto,  such further
amount as shall be  sufficient  to cover any amounts  due to the  Trustee  under
Section 907.

               If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such
demand,  the Trustee,  in its own name and as trustee of an express  trust,  may
institute  a  judicial  proceeding  for the  collection  of the  sums so due and
unpaid,  may  prosecute  such  proceeding  to judgment  or final  decree and may
enforce the same against the Company or any other  obligor upon such  Securities
and collect the moneys  adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided
by law out of the  property  of the  Company  or any  other  obligor  upon  such
Securities, wherever situated.

               If an Event of Default with respect to  Securities  of any series
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed
to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of
such series by such appropriate  judicial  proceedings as the Trustee shall deem
most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,  whether for the specific
enforcement  of any  covenant or  agreement  in this  Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

SECTION 804.  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

               In  case  of  the  pendency  of  any  receivership,   insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial  proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities  or the  property  of the  Company or of such other  obligor or their
creditors,  the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
shall  then be due  and  payable  as  therein  expressed  or by  declaration  or
otherwise and  irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on
the Company for the payment of overdue  principal or interest) shall be entitled
and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

               (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of  principal,
      premium, if any, and interest,  if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the
      Securities  and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary
      or  advisable  in order to have the claims of the Trustee  (including  any
      claim for amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907) and of the Holders
      allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

               (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other  property  payable
      or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian,  receiver,  assignee,  trustee,  liquidator,  sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial  proceeding is hereby  authorized by
each  Holder to make such  payments  to the  Trustee  and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to
pay to the Trustee any amounts due it under Section 907.

               Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee
to  authorize  or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan
of  reorganization,   arrangement,   adjustment  or  composition  affecting  the
Securities  or the rights of any Holder  thereof or to authorize  the Trustee to
vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 805.  Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.

               All  rights of action  and claims  under  this  Indenture  or the
Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee  without the possession
of any of the  Securities or the production  thereof in any proceeding  relating
thereto,  and any such proceeding  instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in
its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,
after  provision  for the  payment  of the  reasonable  compensation,  expenses,
disbursements  and advances of the Trustee,  its agents and counsel,  be for the
ratable  benefit of the  Holders in  respect  of which  such  judgment  has been
recovered.

SECTION 806.  Application of Money Collected.

               Subject to the provisions of Article Fifteen, any money collected
by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order,
at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee  and, in case of the  distribution  of
such money on account of principal or premium, if any, or interest, if any, upon
presentation  of the  Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which
such money shall have been collected and the notation  thereon of the payment if
only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

               First:  To the  payment  of all  amounts  due the  Trustee  under
Section 907;

               Second:  To the payment of the  amounts  then due and unpaid upon
the  Securities for principal of and premium,  if any, and interest,  if any, in
respect of which or for the  benefit  of which  such  money has been  collected,
ratably,  without  preference or priority of any kind,  according to the amounts
due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest,
if any, respectively; and

               Third: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or
to  whomsoever  may be  lawfully  entitled  to receive the same or as a court of
competent jurisdiction may direct.

SECTION 807.  Limitation on Suits.

               No Holder  shall  have any  right to  institute  any  proceeding,
judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of
a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

               (a) such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the
      Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of
      such series;

               (b)  the  Holders  of not  less  than  a  majority  in  aggregate
      principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of
      which  an  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and  be  continuing,
      considered as one class, shall have made written request to the Trustee to
      institute  proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name
      as Trustee hereunder;

               (c) such  Holder or  Holders  shall have  offered to the  Trustee
      reasonable  indemnity  against the costs,  expenses and  liabilities to be
      incurred in compliance with such request;

               (d) the  Trustee  for 60 days after its  receipt of such  notice,
      request and offer of  indemnity  shall have failed to  institute  any such
      proceeding; and

               (e) no direction  inconsistent  with such written  request  shall
      have been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of
      a majority in aggregate
<PAGE>
                                       -43-

      principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of
      which  an  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and  be  continuing,
      considered as one class;

it being  understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner  whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this  Indenture to affect,  disturb or  prejudice  the rights of any other of
such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain  priority or preference  over any
other of such  Holders or to enforce any right under this  Indenture,  except in
the manner herein  provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such
Holders.

SECTION 808.  Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal,
              Premium and Interest.

               Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder
of any Security shall have the right,  which is absolute and  unconditional,  to
receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section
307 and 311)  interest,  if any,  on such  Security  on the Stated  Maturity  or
Maturities  expressed in such  Security (or, in the case of  redemption,  on the
Redemption  Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment,
and such rights shall not be impaired  without the consent of such  Holder.  Any
holder of related  Preferred  Securities  shall have the right to institute suit
for  the  enforcement  of any  such  payment  to such  holder  with  respect  to
Securities relating to such Preferred Securities having a principal amount equal
to  the  aggregate  liquidation  preference  amount  of  the  related  Preferred
Securities held by such holder.

SECTION 809.  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

               If the Trustee or any Holder has  instituted  any  proceeding  to
enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding  shall have
been  discontinued  or abandoned for any reason,  or shall have been  determined
adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject
to any  determination  in such  proceeding,  the  Company,  and Trustee and such
Holder shall be restored  severally and  respectively to their former  positions
hereunder and  thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and such Holder
shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

SECTION 810.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

               Except as  otherwise  provided in the last  paragraph  of Section
306, no right or remedy herein  conferred  upon or reserved to the Trustee or to
the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy,  and every
right and remedy shall,  to the extent  permitted by law, be  cumulative  and in
addition to every other right and remedy  given  hereunder  or now or  hereafter
existing at law or in equity or  otherwise.  The  assertion or employment of any
right or remedy  hereunder,  or  otherwise,  shall not  prevent  the  concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

<PAGE>
                                       -44-

SECTION 811.  Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

               No delay or  omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise
any right or remedy  accruing  upon any Event of Default  shall  impair any such
right or  remedy  or  constitute  a waiver of any such  Event of  Default  or an
acquiescence therein.  Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to
the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised  from time to time,  and as often
as may be deemed  expedient,  by the Trustee or by the Holders,  as the case may
be.

SECTION 812.  Control by Holders of Securities.

               If an Event of Default  shall have  occurred and be continuing in
respect of a series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding  Securities of such series shall have the right to direct the
time,  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee,  or exercising  any trust or power  conferred on the Trustee,  with
respect to the Securities of such series; provided, however, that if an Event of
Default  shall have  occurred  and be  continuing  with respect to more than one
series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Outstanding  Securities of all such series,  considered as one class,  shall
have the right to make such direction,  and not the Holders of the Securities of
any one of such series; and provided,  further, that such direction shall not be
in conflict with any rule of law or with this  Indenture.  Before  proceeding to
exercise any right or power  hereunder at the  direction  of such  Holders,  the
Trustee  shall be entitled to receive from such Holders  reasonable  security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by
it in compliance with any such direction.

SECTION 813.  Waiver of Past Defaults.

               The  Holders of not less than a majority in  principal  amount of
the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the
Securities of such series waive any past default  hereunder with respect to such
series and its consequences, except a default

               (a) in the payment of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any, or
      interest, if any, on any Security of such series, or

               (b) in respect of a covenant  or  provision  hereof  which  under
      Section  1202  cannot be  modified  or amended  without the consent of the
      Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected;

provided,  however,  that so long as a Trust holds the Securities of any series,
such  Trust may not waive any past  default  without  the  consent of at least a
majority  in  aggregate  liquidation  preference  of the  outstanding  Preferred
Securities  issued by such Trust  affected,  obtained  as  provided in the Trust
Agreement pertaining to such Trust.

<PAGE>
                                       -45-

               Upon any such waiver,  such default shall cease to exist, and any
and all Events of Default arising  therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured,
for every  purpose of this  Indenture;  but no such waiver  shall  extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 814.  Undertaking for Costs.

               The  Company  and the  Trustee  agree,  and  each  Holder  by his
acceptance  thereof  shall be deemed to have  agreed,  that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this  Indenture,  or in any suit  against  the  Trustee  for any  action  taken,
suffered or omitted by it as Trustee,  the filing by any party  litigant in such
suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in
its discretion assess reasonable costs,  including  reasonable  attorneys' fees,
against  any party  litigant  in such suit,  having due regard to the merits and
good  faith of the  claims or  defenses  made by such  party  litigant;  but the
provisions  of this  Section  shall  not  apply  to any suit  instituted  by the
Company,  to any suit  instituted by the Trustee,  to any suit instituted by any
Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of which
such suit may be brought,  considered as one class, or to any suit instituted by
any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if
any, or  interest,  if any, on any  Security on or after the Stated  Maturity or
Maturities  expressed in such  Security  (or, in the case of  redemption,  on or
after the Redemption Date).

SECTION 815.  Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

               The Company  covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so)
that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner  whatsoever
claim or take the benefit or advantage  of, any stay or  extension  law wherever
enacted,  now or at any time hereafter in force,  which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law

SECTION 901.  Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

               (a) The  Trustee  shall have and be subject to all the duties and
      responsibilities  specified  with respect to an  indenture  trustee in the
      Trust Indenture Act and no implied  covenants or obligations shall be read
      into this Indenture against the Trustee.

                                       -46-

               (b) No provision of this  Indenture  shall require the Trustee to
      expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
      the performance of any of its duties hereunder,  or in the exercise of any
      of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing
      that  repayment of such funds or adequate  indemnity  against such risk or
      liability is not reasonably assured to it.

               (c)  Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Indenture to the
      contrary,  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of the  Trustee  under this
      Indenture  shall  be  subject  to  the   protections,   exculpations   and
      limitations  on liability  afforded to the Trustee under the provisions of
      the Trust Indenture Act.

               (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision
      of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
      affording  protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of
      this Section.

SECTION 902.  Notice of Defaults.

               The  Trustee  shall give  notice of any  default  hereunder  with
respect to the  Securities  of any series to the Holders of  Securities  of such
series in the manner and to the extent  required to do so by the Trust Indenture
Act,  unless such default  shall have been cured or waived;  provided,  however,
that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 801(c), no
such  notice  to  Holders  shall be given  until  at  least  45 days  after  the
occurrence  thereof.  For the purpose of this Section,  the term "default" means
any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become,  an
Event of Default.

SECTION 903.  Certain Rights of Trustee.

               Subject to the  provisions  of Section 901 and to the  applicable
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act:

               (a) the  Trustee  may rely and  shall be  protected  in acting or
      refraining  from  acting in good faith upon any  resolution,  certificate,
      statement,   instrument,  opinion,  report,  notice,  request,  direction,
      consent,  order, bond, debenture,  note, other evidence of indebtedness or
      other  paper or  document  reasonably  believed by it to be genuine and to
      have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

               (b) any  request or  direction  of the Company  mentioned  herein
      shall be sufficiently  evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, or
      as otherwise expressly provided herein, and any resolution of the Board of
      Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;

               (c) whenever in the  administration of this Indenture the Trustee
      shall deem it desirable  that a matter be proved or  established  prior to
      taking,  suffering or omitting any action  hereunder,  the Trustee (unless
      other evidence be herein specifically

<PAGE>
                                       -47-

      prescribed)  may,  in the  absence of bad faith on its part,  rely upon an
      Officer's Certificate;

               (d) the Trustee may consult with  counsel and the written  advice
      of such  counsel  or any  Opinion of  Counsel  shall be full and  complete

               (e) the Trustee  shall be under no  obligation to exercise any of
      the  rights or powers  vested in it by this  Indenture  at the  request or
      direction  of any Holder  pursuant to this  Indenture,  unless such Holder
      shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against
      the costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  which  might be  incurred by it in
      compliance with such request or direction;

               (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into
      the facts or matters  stated in any  resolution,  certificate,  statement,
      instrument,  opinion, report, notice, request, direction,  consent, order,
      bond,  debenture,  note,  other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or
      document,  but the  Trustee,  in its  discretion,  may make  such  further
      inquiry  or  investigation  into such  facts or matters as it may see fit,
      and,  if the  Trustee  shall  determine  to make such  further  inquiry or
      investigation,  it shall  (subject to applicable  legal  requirements)  be
      entitled to examine,  during normal business hours, the books, records and
      premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;

               (g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder
      or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
      attorneys and the Trustee shall not be  responsible  for any misconduct or
      negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by
      it hereunder; and

               (h) the  Trustee  shall  not be  charged  with  knowledge  of any
      default  or Event of  Default,  as the case may be,  with  respect  to the
      Securities  of any series for which it is acting as Trustee  unless either
      (1) a Responsible  Officer of the Trustee  shall have actual  knowledge of
      the default or Event of Default, as the case may be, or (2) written notice
      of such  default or Event of Default,  as the case may be, shall have been
      given to the Trustee by the Company,  any other obligor on such Securities
      or by any Holder of such Securities.

SECTION 904.  Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.

               The recitals  contained herein and in the Securities  (except the
Trustee's  certificates of  authentication)  shall be taken as the statements of
the  Company,  and  neither the Trustee  nor any  Authenticating  Agent  assumes
responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to
the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities.  Neither the
Trustee  nor  any  Authenticating  Agent  shall  be  accountable  for the use or
application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.

                                       -48-

SECTION 905.  May Hold Securities.

               Each of the Trustee, any Authenticating  Agent, any Paying Agent,
any Security  Registrar or any other agent of the Company,  in its individual or
any other capacity,  may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and,  subject
to Sections  908 and 913,  may  otherwise  deal with the  Company  with the same
rights it would have if it were not the Trustee,  Authenticating  Agent,  Paying
Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.

SECTION 906. Money Held in Trust.

               Money  held  by  the  Trustee  in  trust  hereunder  need  not be
segregated  from other funds,  except to the extent required by law. The Trustee
shall be under no liability  for interest on any money  received by it hereunder
except as expressly  provided herein or otherwise  agreed with, and for the sole
benefit of, the Company.

SECTION 907.  Compensation and Reimbursement.

               The Company shall

               (a) pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable  compensation
      for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be
      limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee
      of an express trust);

               (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein,  reimburse the
      Trustee upon its request for all reasonable  expenses,  disbursements  and
      advances reasonably incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any
      provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the
      expenses  and  disbursements  of its  agents and  counsel),  except to the
      extent that any such expense,  disbursement or advance may be attributable
      to the Trustee's negligence, wilful misconduct or bad faith; and

               (c)  indemnify  the Trustee  for,  and hold it harmless  from and
      against,  any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred by it arising
      out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust
      or trusts hereunder or the performance of its duties hereunder,  including
      the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or
      liability in  connection  with the exercise or  performance  of any of its
      powers or duties hereunder,  except to the extent any such loss, liability
      or expense may be attributable to its negligence, wilful misconduct or bad
      faith.

               As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company
under this Section,  the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities  upon
all  property  and funds  held or  collected  by the  Trustee as such other than
property and funds held in trust under Section 703 (except as otherwise provided
in Section  703).  "Trustee"  for  purposes of this  Section  shall  include any
predecessor Trustee; provided, however, that the negligence, wilful

<PAGE>
                                       -49-

misconduct or bad faith of any Trustee  hereunder shall not affect the rights of
any other Trustee hereunder.

               In addition to the rights provided to the Trustee pursuant to the
provisions of the immediately  preceding paragraph of this Section 907, when the
Trustee  incurs  expenses  or renders  services in  connection  with an Event of
Default specified in Section 801(d) or Section 801(e),  the expenses  (including
the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the
services  are  intended  to  constitute  expenses  of  administration  under any
applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.

SECTION 908.  Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.

               If the  Trustee  shall have or acquire any  conflicting  interest
within the meaning of the Trust  Indenture  Act, it shall either  eliminate such
conflicting interest or resign to the extent, in the manner and with the effect,
and  subject to the  conditions,  provided in the Trust  Indenture  Act and this
Indenture.  For purposes of Section  310(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act and to
the extent permitted thereby, the Trustee, in its capacity as trustee in respect
of the  Securities  of any  series,  shall not be  deemed to have a  conflicting
interest  arising from its capacity as trustee in respect of the  Securities  of
any other series. The Trust Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement  pertaining to
each Trust shall be deemed to be  specifically  described in this  Indenture for
the purposes of clause (i) of the first proviso  contained in Section  310(b) of
the Trust Indenture Act.

SECTION 909.  Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

               There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be

               (a) a corporation  organized and doing business under the laws of
      the United  States,  any State or  Territory  thereof or the  District  of
      Columbia,  authorized under such laws to exercise  corporate trust powers,
      having a combined capital and surplus of at least  $50,000,000 and subject
      to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, or

               (b) if and to the extent  permitted  by the  Commission  by rule,
      regulation  or order  upon  application,  a  corporation  or other  Person
      organized  and doing  business  under  the laws of a  foreign  government,
      authorized  under such laws to exercise  corporate trust powers,  having a
      combined  capital  and  surplus  of at  least  $50,000,000  or the  Dollar
      equivalent of the applicable  foreign  currency and subject to supervision
      or  examination  by authority of such  foreign  government  or a political
      subdivision thereof substantially equivalent to supervision or examination
      applicable to United States institutional trustees,

and, in either case,  qualified  and  eligible  under this Article and the Trust
Indenture  Act. If such  corporation  publishes  reports of  condition  at least
annually,  pursuant  to  law or to  the  requirements  of  such  supervising  or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section,

<PAGE>
                                       -50-  

the combined capital and surplus of such  corporation  shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition
so  published.  If at any  time  the  Trustee  shall  cease  to be  eligible  in
accordance with the provisions of this Section,  it shall resign  immediately in
the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

SECTION 910.  Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

               (a) No  resignation  or removal of the Trustee and no appointment
      of a successor  Trustee  pursuant to this Article  shall become  effective
      until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance
      with the applicable requirements of Section 911.

               (b) The  Trustee  may  resign  at any time  with  respect  to the
      Securities of one or more series by giving  written  notice thereof to the
      Company.  If the instrument of acceptance by a successor  Trustee required
      by Section 911 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days
      after the giving of such notice of resignation,  the resigning Trustee may
      petition  any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the  appointment  of a
      successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

               (c) The  Trustee  may be removed at any time with  respect to the
      Securities  of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal
      amount of the  Outstanding  Securities  of such  series  delivered  to the
      Trustee  and to the  Company;  provided  that  so  long  as any  Preferred
      Securities  remain  outstanding,  the Trust which  issued  such  Preferred
      Securities  shall not execute  any Act to remove the  Trustee  without the
      consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate  liquidation  preference
      of  Preferred  Securities  issued by such Trust  outstanding,  obtained as
      provided in the Trust Agreement pertaining to such Trust.

               (d) If at any time:

                     (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 908 after
                  written  request  therefor by the Company or by any Holder who
                  has been a bona fide Holder for at least six months, or

                     (2) the Trustee  shall cease to be eligible  under  Section
                  909 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by
                  the Company or by any such Holder, or

                     (3) the Trustee  shall become  incapable of acting or shall
                  be  adjudged  a bankrupt  or  insolvent  or a receiver  of the
                  Trustee or of its  property  shall be  appointed or any public
                  officer  shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its
                  property  or  affairs  for  the  purpose  of   rehabilitation,
                  conservation or liquidation,

then,  in any such case,  (x) the Company by a Board  Resolution  may remove the
Trustee with respect to all Securities or (y) subject to Section 814, any Holder
who has been a bona fide

<PAGE>
                                       -51-

Holder  for at least  six  months  may,  on  behalf of  himself  and all  others
similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal
of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor
Trustee or Trustees.

               (e) If the Trustee shall resign,  be removed or become  incapable
      of acting,  or if a vacancy  shall  occur in the office of Trustee for any
      cause (other than as  contemplated in clause (y) in subsection (d) of this
      Section),  with  respect  to the  Securities  of one or more  series,  the
      Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee
      or Trustees  with  respect to the  Securities  of that or those series (it
      being  understood  that any such  successor  Trustee may be appointed with
      respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at
      any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of
      any particular  series) and shall comply with the applicable  requirements
      of Section 911.  If,  within one year after such  resignation,  removal or
      incapability,  or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with
      respect to the  Securities  of any series shall be appointed by Act of the
      Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
      such  series  delivered  to the  Company  and the  retiring  Trustee,  the
      successor  Trustee so appointed  shall,  forthwith  upon its acceptance of
      such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section
      911,  become the successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
      series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the
      Company.  If no successor  Trustee with respect to the  Securities  of any
      series  shall have been so  appointed  by the  Company or the  Holders and
      accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 911, any Holder who
      has been a bona fide  Holder of a Security of such series for at least six
      months  may,  on behalf  of  itself  and all  others  similarly  situated,
      petition  any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the  appointment  of a
      successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

               (f) So long as no event  which  is,  or after  notice or lapse of
      time, or both,  would become,  an Event of Default shall have occurred and
      be  continuing,  and except with respect to a Trustee  appointed by Act of
      the  Holders  of  a  majority  in  principal  amount  of  the  Outstanding
      Securities  pursuant to  subsection  (e) of this  Section,  if the Company
      shall have  delivered to the Trustee (i) a Board  Resolution  appointing a
      successor Trustee,  effective as of a date specified therein,  and (ii) an
      instrument of acceptance of such  appointment,  effective as of such date,
      by such  successor  Trustee in  accordance  with  Section 911, the Trustee
      shall be deemed to have resigned as contemplated in subsection (b) of this
      Section,  the successor  Trustee shall be deemed to have been appointed by
      the  Company   pursuant  to  subsection  (e)  of  this  Section  and  such
      appointment  shall be deemed  to have been  accepted  as  contemplated  in
      Section 911, all as of such date, and all other provisions of this Section
      and Section 911 shall be applicable to such  resignation,  appointment and
      acceptance except to the extent inconsistent with this subsection (f).

               (g) The Company  shall give notice of each  resignation  and each
      removal of the Trustee  with respect to the  Securities  of any series and
      each appointment of a successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities of
      any series by mailing  written notice of such event by  first-class  mail,
      postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of such

<PAGE>
                                       -52-

      series as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register.  Each
      notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the
      Securities of such series and the address of its corporate trust office.

SECTION 911.  Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

               (a) In case of the appointment  hereunder of a successor  Trustee
      with respect to the Securities of all series, every such successor Trustee
      so appointed shall execute,  acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to
      the  retiring  Trustee  an  instrument  accepting  such  appointment,  and
      thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring  Trustee shall become
      effective  and such  successor  Trustee,  without any further act, deed or
      conveyance,  shall become vested with all the rights,  powers,  trusts and
      duties of the retiring Trustee;  but, on the request of the Company or the
      successor  Trustee,  such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of all sums
      owed  to it,  execute  and  deliver  an  instrument  transferring  to such
      successor  Trustee  all the  rights,  powers  and  trusts of the  retiring
      Trustee and shall duly  assign,  transfer  and  deliver to such  successor
      Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

               (b) In case of the appointment  hereunder of a successor  Trustee
      with respect to the  Securities  of one or more (but not all) series,  the
      Company,  the retiring Trustee and each successor  Trustee with respect to
      the  Securities  of one or  more  series  shall  execute  and  deliver  an
      indenture  supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept
      such  appointment  and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be
      necessary  or  desirable  to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each
      successor  Trustee  all the  rights,  powers,  trusts  and  duties  of the
      retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to
      which  the  appointment  of such  successor  Trustee  relates,  (2) if the
      retiring  Trustee is not retiring  with respect to all  Securities,  shall
      contain  such  provisions  as shall be deemed  necessary  or  desirable to
      confirm  that all the rights,  powers,  trusts and duties of the  retiring
      Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which
      the retiring  Trustee is not retiring  shall  continue to be vested in the
      retiring  Trustee and (3) shall add to or change any of the  provisions of
      this  Indenture  as shall be necessary  to provide for or  facilitate  the
      administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee,  it being
      understood  that nothing herein or in such  supplemental  indenture  shall
      constitute such Trustees  co-trustees of the same trust and that each such
      Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart
      from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee;
      and upon the  execution  and delivery of such  supplemental  indenture the
      resignation or removal of the retiring  Trustee shall become  effective to
      the extent provided therein and each such successor  Trustee,  without any
      further act, deed or conveyance,  shall become vested with all the rights,
      powers,  trusts and duties of the  retiring  Trustee  with  respect to the
      Securities  of that or those  series  to  which  the  appointment  of such
      successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor
      Trustee, such retiring Trustee, upon payment of all sums owed to it, shall
      duly assign,  transfer and deliver to such successor  Trustee all property
      and money held by such  retiring  Trustee  hereunder  with  respect to the
      Securities  of that or those  series  to  which  the  appointment  of such
      successor Trustee relates.

<PAGE>
                                       -53-

               (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
      execute any instruments  which fully vest in and confirm to such successor
      Trustee all such rights,  powers and trusts  referred to in subsection (a)
      or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

               (d) No successor  Trustee shall accept its appointment  unless at
      the time of such acceptance such successor  Trustee shall be qualified and
      eligible under this Article.

SECTION 912. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.

               Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted
or with which it may be  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting  from any
merger,  conversion or  consolidation  to which the Trustee shall be a party, or
any  corporation  succeeding to all or  substantially  all the  corporate  trust
business  of the  Trustee,  shall be the  successor  of the  Trustee  hereunder,
provided such corporation  shall be otherwise  qualified and eligible under this
Article,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of any of the  parties  hereto.  In case any  Securities  shall  have  been
authenticated,  but not delivered,  by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger,  conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such  authentication  and deliver the Securities so authenticated  with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

SECTION 913.  Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

               If the  Trustee  shall be or become a creditor  of the Company or
any other obligor upon the  Securities  (other than by reason of a  relationship
described in Section  311(b) of the Trust  Indenture  Act), the Trustee shall be
subject  to any  and  all  applicable  provisions  of the  Trust  Indenture  Act
regarding the  collection of claims  against the Company or such other  obligor.
For purposes of Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act:

               (a) the term "cash  transaction"  means any  transaction in which
      full payment for goods or securities  sold is made within seven days after
      delivery  of the goods or  securities  in  currency  or in checks or other
      orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand;

               (b) the term  "self-liquidating  paper" means any draft,  bill of
      exchange,  acceptance or obligation  which is made,  drawn,  negotiated or
      incurred  by the  Company  for the  purpose  of  financing  the  purchase,
      processing,  manufacturing,  shipment,  storage or sale of goods, wares or
      merchandise  and  which is  secured  by  documents  evidencing  title  to,
      possession  of, or a lien upon,  the goods,  wares or  merchandise  or the
      receivables  or  proceeds  arising  from the sale of the  goods,  wares or
      merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is
      received by the Trustee  simultaneously  with the creation of the creditor
      relationship with the

<PAGE>
                                       -54-

      Company  arising  from  the  making, drawing,  negotiating or incurring
      of the draft,  bill of  exchange, acceptance or obligation.

SECTION 914. Co-trustees and Separate Trustees.

               At any time or  times,  for the  purpose  of  meeting  the  legal
requirements of any applicable  jurisdiction,  the Company and the Trustee shall
have power to appoint,  and,  upon the written  request of the Trustee or of the
Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Securities then  Outstanding,
the Company  shall for such purpose join with the Trustee in the  execution  and
delivery of all instruments and agreements  necessary or proper to appoint,  one
or more Persons  approved by the Trustee  either to act as  co-trustee,  jointly
with the Trustee, or to act as separate trustee, in either case with such powers
as may be provided in the instrument of appointment,  and to vest in such Person
or Persons,  in the capacity  aforesaid,  any  property,  title,  right or power
deemed necessary or desirable,  subject to the other provisions of this Section.
If the  Company  does not join in such  appointment  within  15 days  after  the
receipt  by it of a  request  so to do,  or if an Event of  Default  shall  have
occurred  and be  continuing,  the  Trustee  alone shall have power to make such
appointment.

               Should any written  instrument or instruments from the Company be
required  by any  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee so  appointed  to more fully
confirm to such co-trustee or separate  trustee such property,  title,  right or
power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged
and delivered by the Company.

               Every  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee  shall,  to  the  extent
permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following
conditions:

               (a) the Securities shall be authenticated and delivered,  and all
      rights, powers, duties and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody
      of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be
      deposited  or pledged  with,  the Trustee  hereunder,  shall be  exercised
      solely, by the Trustee;

               (b) the rights,  powers,  duties and obligations hereby conferred
      or imposed  upon the  Trustee in respect of any  property  covered by such
      appointment  shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed
      either by the Trustee or by the Trustee  and such  co-trustee  or separate
      trustee  jointly,  as shall be provided in the instrument  appointing such
      co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of
      any  jurisdiction  in which any  particular  act is to be  performed,  the
      Trustee shall be  incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which
      event such rights,  powers,  duties and obligations shall be exercised and
      performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee;

               (c) the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed
      by it, with the concurrence of the Company,  may accept the resignation of
      or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section,
      and, if an Event of Default  shall have  occurred and be  continuing,  the
      Trustee shall have power to accept the

<PAGE>
                                       -55-

      resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without
      the  concurrence of the Company.  Upon the written request of the Trustee,
      the Company  shall join with the Trustee in the  execution and delivery of
      all  instruments  and  agreements  necessary or proper to effectuate  such
      resignation or removal.  A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee
      so  resigned or removed may be  appointed  in the manner  provided in this
      Section;

               (d)  no  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee   hereunder  shall  be
      personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Trustee,  or any
      other such trustee hereunder; and

               (e) any Act of Holders  delivered to the Trustee  shall be deemed
      to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.

SECTION 915. Appointment of Authenticating Agent

               The Trustee may  appoint an  Authenticating  Agent or Agents with
respect to the  Securities  of one or more series,  which shall be authorized to
act on behalf of the Trustee to  authenticate  Securities  of such series issued
upon original  issuance and upon exchange,  registration  of transfer or partial
redemption  thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so  authenticated
shall be  entitled  to the  benefits  of this  Indenture  and shall be valid and
obligatory  for all  purposes  as if  authenticated  by the  Trustee  hereunder.
Wherever  reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery
of  Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's  certificate  of  authentication,
such reference shall be deemed to include  authentication and delivery on behalf
of the Trustee by an  Authenticating  Agent and a certificate of  authentication
executed  on  behalf  of  the   Trustee  by  an   Authenticating   Agent.   Each
Authenticating  Agent shall be  acceptable to the Company and shall at all times
be a  corporation  organized  and doing  business  under the laws of the  United
States,  any State or territory thereof or the District of Columbia,  authorized
under such laws to act as  Authenticating  Agent,  having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than  $50,000,000  and subject to supervision or examination
by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of
condition  at least  annually,  pursuant to law or to the  requirements  of said
supervising or examining  authority,  then for the purposes of this Section, the
combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating  Agent shall be deemed to be
its  combined  capital  and  surplus as set forth in its most  recent  report of
condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section,  such Authenticating
Agent shall resign  immediately  in the manner and with the effect  specified in
this Section.

               Any corporation into which an Authenticating  Agent may be merged
or converted or with which it may be consolidated,  or any corporation resulting
from any merger,  conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party,  or any  corporation  succeeding  to the  corporate  agency or
corporate  trust business of an  Authenticating  Agent,  shall continue to be an
Authenticating  Agent,  provided such  corporation  shall be otherwise  eligible
under this Section,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

<PAGE>
                                       -56-

               An Authenticating  Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice  thereof to the Trustee and to the  Company.  The Trustee may at any time
terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof
to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation  or  upon  such  a  termination,   or  in  case  at  any  time  such
Authenticating  Agent  shall  cease  to  be  eligible  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of this Section,  the Trustee may appoint a successor  Authenticating
Agent which shall be  acceptable to the Company.  Any  successor  Authenticating
Agent upon acceptance of its appointment  hereunder shall become vested with all
the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder,  with like effect as
if originally  named as an  Authenticating  Agent.  No successor  Authenticating
Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

               The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating  Agent from time
to time  reasonable  compensation  for its services under this Section,  and the
Trustee  shall be entitled to be  reimbursed  for such  payments,  in accordance
with, and subject to the provisions of Section 907.

               The  provisions  of Sections 308, 904 and 905 shall be applicable
to each Authenticating Agent.

               If an  appointment  with respect to the Securities of one or more
series shall be made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may
have   endorsed   thereon,   in  addition  to  the  Trustee's   certificate   of
authentication,  an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the
following form:


               This is one of the  Securities of the series  designated  therein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.


                                            ------------------------
                                            As Trustee

                                                Agent

                                            By
                                              ----------------------
                                              Authorized Signatory


               If all of the Securities of a series may not be originally issued
at  one  time,   and  if  the  Trustee  does  not  have  an  office  capable  of
authenticating  Securities upon original  issuance located in a Place of Payment
where the Company wishes to have  Securities of such series  authenticated  upon
original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which
writing  need not comply  with  Section  102 and need not be  accompanied  by an
Opinion of  Counsel),  shall  appoint,  in  accordance  with this Section and in
accordance  with such  procedures  as shall be  acceptable  to the  Trustee,  an
Authenticating Agent having an

<PAGE>
                                       -57-

office in a Place of Payment  designated  by the  Company  with  respect to such
series of Securities.

      enforcement  of any such  payment on or after the Stated  Maturity  of any
      Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date),
      without, in any such case, the consent of the Holder of such Security, or

               (b) reduce the percentage in principal  amount of the Outstanding
      Securities of any series (or, if applicable,  in liquidation preference of
      any series of Preferred  Securities),  the consent of the Holders of which
      is required  for any such  supplemental  indenture,  or the consent of the
      Holders  of  which is  required  for any  waiver  of  compliance  with any
      provision  of  this  Indenture  or  of  any  default   hereunder  and  its
      consequences,  or reduce the  requirements  of Section  1304 for quorum or
      voting,  without,  in any such case,  the  consent of the  Holders of each
      Outstanding Security of such series, or

               (c) modify any of the provisions of this Section,  Section 607 or
      Section  813 with  respect  to the  Securities  of any  series,  except to
      increase the  percentages in principal  amount referred to in this Section
      or such  other  Sections  or to  provide  that  other  provisions  of this
      Indenture  cannot be modified or waived  without the consent of the Holder
      of each Outstanding  Security affected thereby;  provided,  however,  that
      this clause  shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with
      respect to changes in the  references  to "the  Trustee"  and  concomitant
      changes in this Section,  or the deletion of this  proviso,  in accordance
      with the requirements of Sections 911(b) and 1201(h).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as any of the Preferred Securities remain
outstanding,  the Trustee may not consent to a supplemental indenture under this
Section  1202  without  the  prior  consent,  obtained  as  provided  in a Trust
Agreement pertaining to a Trust which issued such Preferred  Securities,  of the
holders of not less than a majority in aggregate  liquidation  preference of all
Preferred Securities issued by such Trust affected, considered as one class, or,
in the case of changes  described  in clauses  (a),  (b) and (c) above,  100% in
aggregate   liquidation   preference  of  all  such  Preferred  Securities  then
outstanding  which  would  be  affected  thereby,  considered  as one  class.  A
supplemental  indenture  which  changes  or  eliminates  any  covenant  or other
provision of this  Indenture  which has expressly  been included  solely for the
benefit of one or more  particular  series of Securities,  or which modifies the
rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant
or other

<PAGE>
                                       -62-

provision,  shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the
Holders of Securities of any other series.

               It shall  not be  necessary  for any Act of  Holders  under  this
Section to approve the particular form of any proposed  supplemental  indenture,
but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall  approve the substance  thereof.  A
waiver by a Holder of such Holder's right to consent under this Section shall be
deemed to be a consent of such Holder.

SECTION 1203. Execution of Supplemental Indentures.

               In executing,  or accepting the additional trusts created by, any
supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of
the trusts created by this Indenture,  the Trustee shall be entitled to receive,
and  (subject  to Section  901) shall be fully  protected  in relying  upon,  an
Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental  indenture is
authorized  or  permitted by this  Indenture.  The Trustee may, but shall not be
obligated  to,  enter into any such  supplemental  indenture  which  affects the
Trustee's own rights, duties,  immunities or liabilities under this Indenture or
otherwise.

SECTION 1204. Effect of Supplemental Indentures.

               Upon the  execution  of any  supplemental  indenture  under  this
Article,  this  Indenture  shall be modified in accordance  therewith,  and such
supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and
every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered
hereunder shall be bound thereby.  Any supplemental  indenture permitted by this
Article may restate this Indenture in its entirety,  and, upon the execution and
delivery  thereof,  any such  restatement  shall  supersede  this  Indenture  as
theretofore in effect for all purposes.

SECTION 1205. Conformity With Trust Indenture Act.

               Every  supplemental  indenture  executed pursuant to this Article
shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.

SECTION 1206. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.

               Securities of any series  authenticated  and delivered  after the
execution of any supplemental  indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall
if required by the Trustee,  bear a notation in form  approved by the Trustee as
to any matter provided for in such supplemental  indenture. If the Company shall
so determine,  new  Securities  of any series so modified as to conform,  in the
opinion of the Trustee and the Company,  to any such supplemental  indenture may
be prepared and executed by the Company and  authenticated  and delivered by the
Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.

<PAGE>
                                       -63-

SECTION 1207. Modification Without Supplemental Indenture

               If the terms of any  particular  series of Securities  shall have
been  established  in  a  Board  Resolution  or  an  Officer's   Certificate  as
contemplated  by  Section  301,  and not in an  indenture  supplemental  hereto,
additions to, changes in or the elimination of any of such terms may be effected
by means of a supplemental  Board  Resolution or Officer's  Certificate,  as the
case may be, delivered to, and accepted by, the Trustee; provided, however, that
such  supplemental  Board  Resolution  or  Officer's  Certificate  shall  not be
accepted by the Trustee or  otherwise  be effective  unless all  conditions  set
forth  in this  Indenture  which  would  be  required  to be  satisfied  if such
additions,  changes or elimination  were  contained in a supplemental  indenture
shall have been  appropriately  satisfied.  Upon the  acceptance  thereof by the
Trustee,  any such supplemental Board Resolution or Officer's  Certificate shall
be deemed to be a  "supplemental  indenture"  for  purposes of Section  1204 and
1206.

             Meetings of Holders; Action Without Meeting

               A meeting of Holders of Securities of one or more, or all, series
may be called  at any time and from time to time  pursuant  to this  Article  to

      Manhattan,  The City of New York, as the Trustee shall determine, or, with

      given,  in the manner  provided in Section  106, not less than 21 nor more
      than 180 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting.

               (b) If the Trustee shall have been requested to call a meeting of
      the Holders of Securities of one or more, or all, series by the Company or
      by the Holders of 33% in aggregate principal amount of all of such series,
      considered  as one class,  for any purpose  specified in Section  1301, by
      written request setting forth in reasonable  detail the action proposed to
      be taken at the meeting,  and the Trustee  shall not have given the notice
      of such meeting  within 21 days after receipt of such request or shall not
      thereafter  proceed to cause the  meeting to be held as  provided  herein,
      then the Company or the Holders of Securities of such series in the amount

<PAGE>
                                       -64-

      Manhattan,  The  City of New  York,  or in such  other  place  as shall be
      determined or approved by the Company,  for such meeting and may call such
      meeting  for such  purposes  by  giving  notice  thereof  as  provided  in
      subsection (a) of this Section.

               (c) Any meeting of Holders of  Securities of one or more, or all,
      series  shall be valid  without  notice if the Holders of all  Outstanding
      Securities  of such  series  are  present  in  person  or by proxy  and if
      representatives  of the Company and the Trustee are present,  or if notice
      is waived in writing  before or after the  meeting  by the  Holders of all
      Outstanding  Securities  of  such  series,  or by  such of them as are not
      present at the  meeting in person or by proxy,  and by the Company and the
      Trustee.

SECTION 1303. Persons Entitled to Vote at Meetings.

               To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders of Securities of
one or  more,  or all,  series a  Person  shall  be (a) a Holder  of one or more
Outstanding  Securities  of  such  series,  or  (b)  a  Person  appointed  by an
instrument  in  writing  as  proxy  for a  Holder  or  Holders  of one  or  more
Outstanding  Securities  of such  series  by such  Holder or  Holders.  The only
Persons who shall be entitled to attend any meeting of Holders of  Securities of
any series  shall be the  Persons  entitled  to vote at such  meeting  and their
counsel,   any   representatives   of  the  Trustee  and  its  counsel  and  any

SECTION 1304. Quorum; Action.

               The Persons  entitled to vote a majority in  aggregate  principal
amount of the  Outstanding  Securities  of the  series  with  respect to which a
meeting  shall have been  called as  hereinbefore  provided,  considered  as one
class,  shall constitute a quorum for a meeting of Holders of Securities of such
series;  provided,  however,  that if any action is to be taken at such  meeting
which  this  Indenture  expressly  provides  may be  taken by the  Holders  of a
specified percentage,  which is less than a majority, in principal amount of the
Outstanding  Securities  of such series,  considered  as one class,  the Persons
entitled  to  vote  such  specified   percentage  in  principal  amount  of  the
Outstanding Securities of such series, considered as one class, shall constitute
a quorum.  In the absence of a quorum within one hour of the time  appointed for
any such meeting,  the meeting  shall,  if convened at the request of Holders of
Securities of such series,  be  dissolved.  In any other case the meeting may be
adjourned  for such period as may be  determined  by the chairman of the meeting
prior to the adjournment of such meeting. In the absence of a quorum at any such
adjourned  meeting,  such  adjourned  meeting may be further  adjourned for such
period  as may be  determined  by the  chairman  of  the  meeting  prior  to the
adjournment of such adjourned  meeting.  Except as provided by Section  1305(e),
notice of the  reconvening of any meeting  adjourned for more than 30 days shall
be given as provided in Section  1302(a) not less than 10 days prior to the date
on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Notice of the reconvening of

constitute a quorum.

<PAGE>
                                       -65-

               Except as limited by Section 1202, any resolution  presented to a
meeting or  adjourned  meeting duly  reconvened  at which a quorum is present as
aforesaid  may be  adopted  only by the  affirmative  vote of the  Holders  of a
majority in aggregate  principal  amount of the  Outstanding  Securities  of the
series with respect to which such meeting shall have been called,  considered as
one class;  provided,  however,  that, except as so limited, any resolution with
respect to any action which this  Indenture  expressly  provides may be taken by
the  Holders  of a  specified  percentage,  which is less  than a  majority,  in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, considered as one
class,  may be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned  meeting duly reconvened and
at which a quorum is present as aforesaid by the affirmative vote of the Holders
of such specified  percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding  Securities
of such series, considered as one class.

               Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of Holders
of Securities  duly held in accordance with this Section shall be binding on all
the Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such meeting shall
have been held, whether or not present or represented at the meeting.

SECTION 1305.  Attendance  at Meetings;  Determination  of Voting  Rights;
               Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings.

               (a)  Attendance  at meetings of Holders of  Securities  may be in
      person or by proxy;  and, to the extent  permitted  by law, any such proxy
      shall  remain in  effect  and be  binding  upon any  future  Holder of the
      Securities   with   respect  to  which  it  was  given  unless  and  until
      specifically  revoked  by the Holder or future  Holder of such  Securities
      before being voted.

               (b) Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this Indenture,  the
      Trustee may make such reasonable  regulations as it may deem advisable for
      any meeting of Holders of  Securities in regard to proof of the holding of
      such  Securities  and of the  appointment  of proxies and in regard to the
      appointment  and  duties  of  inspectors  of  votes,  the  submission  and
      examination  of proxies,  certificates  and other evidence of the right to
      vote,  and such other matters  concerning the conduct of the meeting as it
      shall deem appropriate.  Except as otherwise  permitted or required by any
      such regulations,  the holding of Securities shall be proved in the manner
      specified in Section 104 and the  appointment of any proxy shall be proved
      in the manner  specified in Section 104. Such regulations may provide that
      written  instruments  appointing  proxies,  regular on their face,  may be
      presumed valid and genuine  without the proof  specified in Section 104 or
      other proof.

               (c) The Trustee  shall,  by an instrument  in writing,  appoint a
      temporary  chairman of the  meeting,  unless the  meeting  shall have been
      called by the  Company or by Holders as provided  in Section  1302(b),  in
      which case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the series  calling
      the meeting,  as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary
      chairman.  A permanent  chairman and a permanent  secretary of the meeting
      shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to vote a

<PAGE>
                                       -66-

       majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
       all series represented at the meeting, considered as one class.

               (d) At any meeting  each Holder or proxy shall be entitled to one
      vote for each $1 principal  amount of Securities  held or  represented  by
      him;  provided,  however,  that no vote  shall be cast or  counted  at any
      meeting in respect of any Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled
      by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding.  The chairman of the
      meeting  shall have no right to vote,  except as a Holder of a Security or
      proxy.

               (e) Any meeting  duly called  pursuant to Section 1302 at which a
      quorum is present may be adjourned  from time to time by Persons  entitled
      to vote a  majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of the  Outstanding
      Securities  of all series  represented  at the meeting,  considered as one
      class; and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

SECTION 1306. Counting Votes and Recording Action of Meetings.

               The vote upon any resolution  submitted to any meeting of Holders
shall be by written  ballots on which shall be subscribed  the signatures of the
Holders  or of their  representatives  by proxy and the  principal  amounts  and
serial  numbers of the  Outstanding  Securities,  of the series with  respect to
which the meeting  shall have been  called,  held or  represented  by them.  The
permanent  chairman of the meeting  shall  appoint two  inspectors  of votes who
shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any  resolution and who
shall make and file with the  secretary of the meeting  their  verified  written
reports of all votes cast at the meeting.  A record of the  proceedings  of each
meeting of Holders  shall be prepared by the  secretary of the meeting and there
shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes
on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having
knowledge  of the facts  setting  forth a copy of the notice of the  meeting and
showing  that said  notice  was  given as  provided  in  Section  1302  and,  if
applicable,  Section  1304.  Each  copy  shall be  signed  and  verified  by the
affidavits of the  permanent  chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such
copy  shall be  delivered  to the  Company,  and  another  to the  Trustee to be
preserved by the Trustee,  the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted
at the meeting.  Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive  evidence
of the matters therein stated.

SECTION 1307. Action Without Meeting.

               In  lieu  of a vote  of  Holders  at a  meeting  as  hereinbefore
contemplated in this Article,  any request,  demand,  authorization,  direction,
notice,  consent,  waiver or other action may be made, given or taken by Holders
by written instruments as provided in Section 104.

premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Securities, or any part thereof, or
for  any  claim  based  thereon  or  otherwise  in  respect  thereof,  or of the
indebtedness represented thereby, or upon any obligation,  covenant or agreement
under  this  Indenture,  against  any  incorporator,   stockholder,  officer  or

predecessor or successor  corporation),  whether by virtue of any constitutional
provision,  statute or rule of law, or by the  enforcement  of any assessment or
penalty  or  otherwise;  it being  expressly  agreed  and  understood  that this
Indenture and all the Securities are solely corporate  obligations,  and that no
personal  liability   whatsoever  shall  attach  to,  or  be  incurred  by,  any
incorporator,  stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, of the
Company or of any  predecessor  or  successor  corporation,  either  directly or
indirectly  through the Company or any  predecessor  or  successor  corporation,
because of the  indebtedness  hereby  authorized or under or by reason of any of
the obligations,  covenants or agreements  contained in this Indenture or in any
of the  Securities  or to be implied  herefrom or  therefrom,  and that any such
personal  liability is hereby  expressly  waived and released as a condition of,
and as part of the  consideration  for, the execution of this  Indenture and the
issuance of the Securities.

                          Subordination of Securities

SECTION 1501. Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness.

               The Company,  for itself,  its successors and assigns,  covenants
and agrees,  and each Holder of the Securities of each series, by its acceptance
thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that the payment of the principal of and

               Each Holder of the  Securities of each series,  by its acceptance
thereof, authorizes and directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as
may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the  subordination  as provided in

therein or in the instrument under which the same is outstanding, permitting the
holder or holders  thereof to  accelerate  the maturity  thereof (with notice or

                  entitled  except for the provisions of this Article,  shall be
                  paid  or  delivered  by the  person  making  such  payment  or

                  necessary to make  payment in full of all Senior  Indebtedness
                  remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment
                  or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such
                  Senior  Indebtedness,  before any payment or  distribution  is

                  kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, in
                  respect of  principal of or interest on the  Securities  or in
                  connection   with  any   repurchase  by  the  Company  of  the
                  Securities,  shall be  received  by the  Trustee or any Holder
                  before all Senior  Indebtedness  is paid in full, or provision
                  is made for such  payment  in money  or  money's  worth,  such
                  payment or distribution in respect of principal of or interest
                  on the Securities or in connection  with any repurchase by the
                  Company of the Securities shall be paid over to the holders of
                  such   Senior   Indebtedness   or  their   representative   or
                  representatives  or to  the  trustee  or  trustees  under  any
                  indenture  under  which any  instruments  evidencing  any such
                  Senior   Indebtedness   may  have  been  issued,   ratably  as
                  aforesaid,  for  application  to the  payment  of  all  Senior
                  Indebtedness   remaining   unpaid   until   all  such   Senior
                  Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect
                  to  any  concurrent  payment  or  distribution  (or  provision
                  therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

               Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  at any time after the 123rd day
following  the date of deposit of cash or  Government  Obligations  pursuant  to
Section 701  (provided  all  conditions  set out in such Section shall have been
satisfied),  the funds so deposited and any interest thereon will not be subject
to any rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness  including,  without limitation,
those arising under this Article  Fifteen;  provided that no event  described in
clauses  (d) and (e) of Section 801 with  respect to the  Company  has  occurred
during such 123-day period.

               For purposes of this Article only,  the words "cash,  property or
securities"  shall not be deemed to  include  shares of stock of the  Company as
reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation
provided for by a plan or reorganization  or readjustment  which are subordinate
in  right  of  payment  to all  Senior  Indebtedness  which  may at the  time be
outstanding  to the same extent as, or to a greater  extent than, the Securities
are so  subordinated  as  provided in this  Article.  The  consolidation  of the
Company  with,  or the merger of the Company into,  another  corporation  or the
liquidation or  dissolution of the Company  following the conveyance or transfer
of its  property as an entirety,  or  substantially  as an entirety,  to another
corporation upon the terms and conditions  provided for in Article Eleven hereof
shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for
the purposes of this Section 1502 if such other corporation  shall, as a part of
such consolidation,  merger,  conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions
stated in Article Eleven hereof. Nothing in Section 1501 or in this Section 1502
shall  apply to claims of, or  payments  to, the  Trustee  under or  pursuant to
Section 907.

SECTION 1503. Disputes with Holders of Certain Senior Indebtedness.

               Any  failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any
other obligation in respect of Senior Indebtedness,  other than any indebtedness
incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the
Company for money  borrowed (or any  deferral,  renewal,  extension or refunding
thereof) or any other  obligation  as to which the  provisions  of this  Section
shall have been waived by the Company in the  instrument or instruments by which
the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness
or obligation, shall not be deemed a default under clause (b) of Section 1502 if
(i) the  Company  shall be  disputing  its  obligation  to make such  payment or
perform such  obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment  relating to such
dispute  shall have been issued  against the Company  which is in full force and
effect and is not  subject  to further  review,  including  a judgment  that has
become  final by reason of the  expiration  of the time within which a party may
seek  further  appeal or review,  or (B) in the event  that a  judgment  that is
subject to further  review or appeal has been issued,  the Company shall in good
faith be  prosecuting  an appeal or other  proceeding  for  review and a stay or
execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review.

SECTION 1504. Subrogation.

               Senior Indebtedness shall not be deemed to have been paid in full
unless the holders  thereof  shall have  received  cash (or  securities or other
property   satisfactory  to  such  holders)  in  full  payment  of  such  Senior
Indebtedness  then  outstanding.  Subject  to the prior  payment  in full of all
Senior  Indebtedness,  the  rights of the  Holders  of the  Securities  shall be
subrogated  to the rights of the holders of Senior  Indebtedness  to receive any
further payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company
applicable to the holders of the Senior  Indebtedness until all amounts owing on
the  Securities  shall be paid in full;  and such payments or  distributions  of
cash,  property or  securities  received by the  Holders of the  Securities,  by
reason of such subrogation,  which otherwise would be paid or distributed to the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall, as between the Company, its creditors
other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness,  and the Holders, be deemed to be
a payment  by the  Company to or on  account  of Senior  Indebtedness,  it being
understood  that the provisions of this Article are and are intended  solely for
the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and
the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.

SECTION 1505. Obligation of the Company Unconditional.

               Nothing  contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture
or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair,  as among the Company,  its
creditors  other than the holders of Senior  Indebtedness  and the Holders,  the
obligation of the Company,  which is absolute and  unconditional,  to pay to the
Holders the  principal  of and interest on the  Securities  as and when the same
shall become due and payable in accordance  with their terms,  or is intended to
or shall affect the relative  rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company
other than the  holders of Senior  Indebtedness,  nor shall  anything  herein or
therein prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise
permitted by applicable law

<PAGE>
                                       -71-

upon default under this  Indenture,  subject to the rights,  if any,  under this
Article of the holders of Senior  Indebtedness  in respect of cash,  property or
securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.

               Upon any payment or  distribution  of assets or securities of the
Company  referred to in this  Article,  the  Trustee  and the  Holders  shall be
entitled to rely upon any order or decree of a court of  competent  jurisdiction
in which such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings
are pending for the purpose of ascertaining  the persons entitled to participate
in  such  distribution,  the  holders  of  the  Senior  Indebtedness  and  other
indebtedness of the Company,  the amount thereof or payable thereon,  the amount
or amounts paid or distributed thereon, and all other facts pertinent thereto or
to this Article.

SECTION 1506. Priority of Senior Indebtedness Upon Maturity.

               Upon the maturity of the principal of any Senior  Indebtedness by
lapse of time,  acceleration  or  otherwise,  all  matured  principal  of Senior
Indebtedness  and interest and premium,  if any,  thereon shall first be paid in
full before any payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest, if any, is
made upon the Securities or before any Securities can be acquired by the Company
or any sinking fund payment is made with respect to the Securities  (except that
required sinking fund payments may be reduced by Securities acquired before such
maturity of such Senior Indebtedness).

SECTION 1507. Trustee as Holder of Senior Indebtedness.

               The  Trustee  shall be  entitled  to all rights set forth in this
Article with respect to any Senior  Indebtedness  at any time held by it, to the
same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness.  Nothing in this Article
shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.

SECTION 1508. Notice to Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.

               Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this  Article  or any  other
provision of the  Indenture,  the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of
the  existence  of any facts which would  prohibit  the making of any payment of
moneys to or by the  Trustee  unless and until the Trustee  shall have  received
written notice  thereof from the Company,  from a Holder or from a holder of any
Senior Indebtedness or from any representative or representatives of such holder
and,  prior to the receipt of any such  written  notice,  the  Trustee  shall be
entitled,  subject to Section  901, in all respects to assume that no such facts
exist; provided, however, that, if prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the
date upon which by the terms  hereof any such moneys may become  payable for any
purpose,  or in the event of the execution of an instrument  pursuant to Section
702 acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, then if prior to
the second Business Day preceding the date of such execution,  the Trustee shall
not have  received  with respect to such moneys the notice  provided for in this
Section,  then, anything herein contained to the contrary  notwithstanding,  the
Trustee may, in its discretion, receive such moneys and/or apply the same to the
purpose for which they were

<PAGE>
                                       -72-

received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary,  which may be
received  by  it on  or  after  such  date;  provided,  however,  that  no  such
application  shall  affect the  obligations  under this  Article of the  persons
receiving such moneys from the Trustee.

SECTION 1509. Modification, Extension, etc. of Senior Indebtedness

               The holders of Senior  Indebtedness may, without affecting in any
manner the subordination of the payment of the principal of and premium, if any,
and interest, if any, on the Securities, at any time or from time to time and in
their absolute discretion, agree with the Company to change the manner, place or
terms of  payment,  change or extend the time of payment  of, or renew or alter,
any Senior Indebtedness, or amend or supplement any instrument pursuant to which
any Senior  Indebtedness  is issued,  or exercise or refrain from exercising any
other  of  their  rights  under  the  Senior  Indebtedness  including,   without
limitation,  the waiver of default  thereunder,  all without notice to or assent
from the Holders or the Trustee.

SECTION  1510.  Trustee  Has  No  Fiduciary  Duty  to  Holders  of  Senior
                Indebtedness.

               With respect to the holders of Senior  Indebtedness,  the Trustee
undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and objectives as
are  specifically  set forth in this  Indenture,  and no  implied  covenants  or
obligations  with  respect to the holders of Senior  Indebtedness  shall be read
into this Indenture against the Trustee.  The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe
any  fiduciary  duty to the  holders  of Senior  Indebtedness,  and shall not be
liable to any such  holders  if it shall  mistakenly  pay over or deliver to the
Holders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders
of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.

SECTION 1511. Paying Agents Other Than the Trustee.

               In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall
have been  appointed  by the  Company  and be then  acting  hereunder,  the term
"Trustee" as used in this Article  shall in such case (unless the context  shall
otherwise  require) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent
within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent
were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee;  provided,
however,  that Sections 1507, 1508 and 1510 shall not apply to the Company if it
acts as Paying Agent.

SECTION 1512. Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness Not Impaired.

               No right of any present or future  holder of Senior  Indebtedness
to  enforce  the  subordination  herein  shall  at any  time  or in  any  way be
prejudiced  or  impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company
or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms,  provisions and covenants
of this Indenture,  regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have
or be otherwise charged with.

SECTION 1513. Effect of Subordination Provisions; Termination

               Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary, other
than as provided in the immediately  succeeding sentence,  all the provisions of
this Indenture shall be subject to the provisions of this Article, so far as the
same may be applicable thereto.

               Notwithstanding  anything  contained herein to the contrary,  the
provisions  of this  Article  Fifteen  shall be of no  further  effect,  and the
Securities  shall no longer be  subordinated  in right of  payment  to the prior
payment of Senior  Indebtedness,  if the  Company  shall have  delivered  to the
Trustee a notice to such effect.  Any such notice delivered by the Company shall
not be deemed to be a supplemental indenture for purposes of Article Twelve.

                             -------------------------

               This  instrument  may be executed in any number of  counterparts,
each of which  so  executed  shall be  deemed  to be an  original,  but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture
to be duly executed, all as of the day and year first above written.

or her rights  pursuant to Section 5.04 or to a Successor  Guarantee  Trustee on
acceptance by such  Successor  Guarantee  Trustee of its  appointment  to act as
Successor  Guarantee  Trustee.  The right,  title and interest of the  Guarantee

Section  2.06),  the  Guarantee  Trustee  shall  exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Guarantee Agreement, and use the same degree of care

construed to relieve the Guarantee  Trustee from liability for its own negligent
action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct,  except
that:

                            (i) prior to the  occurrence of any Event of Default
                  and after the curing or waiving of all such  Events of Default
                  that may have occurred:

                           Guarantee  Trustee shall be determined  solely by the
                           express provisions of this Guarantee  Agreement,  and
                           the Guarantee  Trustee shall not be liable except for
                           the performance of such duties and obligations as are
                           specifically  set forth in this Guarantee  Agreement;
                           and

                                    (B) in the  absence of bad faith on the part
                           of the Guarantee  Trustee,  the Guarantee Trustee may
                           conclusively  rely, as to the truth of the statements
                           and  the   correctness  of  the  opinions   expressed
                           therein,  upon any certificates or opinions furnished
                           to  the  Guarantee  Trustee  and  conforming  to  the
                           requirements of this Guarantee Agreement;  but in the
                           case of any such certificates or opinions that by any
                           provision  hereof  are  specifically  required  to be
                           furnished to the  Guarantee  Trustee,  the  Guarantee
                           Trustee  shall be under a duty to examine the same to
                           determine   whether  or  not  they   conform  to  the
                           requirements of this Guarantee Agreement;

                           (ii) the  Guarantee  Trustee  shall not be liable for
                  any  error of  judgment  made in good  faith by a  Responsible
                  Officer of the  Guarantee  Trustee,  unless 

                                   -6-
<PAGE>
                  it shall be proved that the  Guarantee  Trustee or such  
                  Responsible  Officer was negligent in ascertaining  the 
                  pertinent facts upon which such judgment was made;

                        (iii) the  Guarantee  Trustee  shall not be liable  with
                  respect  to any  action  taken or omitted to be taken by it in
                  good faith in accordance  with the direction of the Holders of
                  a Majority in liquidation  amount of the Preferred  Securities
                  relating  to the  time,  method  and place of  conducting  any
                  proceeding for any remedy available to the Guarantee  Trustee,
                  or exercising any trust or power  conferred upon the Guarantee
                  Trustee under this Guarantee Agreement; and

                         (iv) no provision  of this  Guarantee  Agreement  shall
                  require the Guarantee  Trustee to expend or risk its own funds
                  or  otherwise  incur  personal  financial   liability  in  the
                  performance  of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
                  its  rights or powers,  if the  Guarantee  Trustee  shall have
                  reasonable  grounds for  believing  that the repayment of such
                  funds or liability is not  reasonably  assured to it under the
                  terms  of  this  Guarantee  Agreement  or  adequate  indemnity
                  against such risk or liability  is not  reasonably  assured to
                  it.

                  the  right at any  time to seek  instructions  concerning  the
                  administration  of this Guarantee  Agreement from any court of
                  competent jurisdiction;

                           (v)  the   Guarantee   Trustee   shall  be  under  no
                  obligation  to exercise any of the rights or powers  vested in
                  it by this Guarantee  Agreement at the request or direction of
                  any  Holder,  unless such  Holder  shall have  provided to the
                  Guarantee  Trustee such  adequate  security  and  indemnity as
                  would  satisfy  a  reasonable  person in the  position  of the
                  Guarantee  Trustee,  against  the costs,  expenses  (including
                  attorneys'  fees and expenses) and  liabilities  that might be
                  incurred by it in complying  with such  request or  direction,
                  including such reasonable  advances as may be requested by the
                  Guarantee  Trustee;  provided that,  nothing contained in this
                  Section  3.02(a)(v)  shall be taken to relieve  the  Guarantee
                  Trustee,  upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default,  of its
                  obligation  to exercise the rights and powers  vested in it by
                  this Guarantee Agreement;

                           (vi) the Guarantee Trustee shall not be bound to make

                  debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper
                  or document reasonably  believed by it to be genuine,  but the
                  Guarantee  Trustee,  in its discretion,  may make such further
                  inquiry or investigation  into such facts or matters as it may
                  see fit;

                           (vii) the  Guarantee  Trustee  may execute any of the
                  trusts or powers  hereunder  or perform  any duties  hereunder

                  with due care by it hereunder;

                           (viii)  whenever  in  the   administration   of  this
                  Guarantee  Agreement  the  Guarantee  Trustee  shall  deem  it
                  desirable  to receive  instructions  with respect to enforcing
                  any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder,  the
                  Guarantee  Trustee  (1)  may  request  instructions  from  the
                  Holders,  (2) may refrain from  enforcing such remedy or right
                  or taking  such  other  action  until  such  instructions  are
                  received,  and (3) shall be protected in acting in  accordance
                  with such instructions; and

                  good faith and  reasonably  believed by it to be authorized or
                  within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by
                  this Guarantee.

                  (b) No provision of this Guarantee  Agreement  shall be deemed
to impose any duty or obligation on the Guarantee  Trustee to perform any act or
acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it
in any  jurisdiction  in which it shall be  illegal,  or in which the  Guarantee
Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance  with  applicable law,
to perform any such act or acts or to exercise  any such right,  power,  duty or
obligation.  No permissive power or authority available to the Guarantee Trustee
shall be construed to be a duty.

                             GUARANTEE TRUSTEE

                  4.01 Guarantee Trustee; Eligibility.

                  (a)  There shall at all times be a Guarantee Trustee which

                           (i)  not be an Affiliate of the Guarantor; and

                           (ii) be a corporation  organized  and doing  business

                  corporation or Person permitted by the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission to act as an institutional  trustee under the Trust

                  corporate trust powers,  having a combined capital and surplus
                  of at least 50 million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000), and subject
                  to supervision or examination by Federal,  State,  Territorial

                  publishes reports of condition at least annually,  pursuant to
                  law or to the  requirements  of the  supervising  or examining
                  authority  referred to above,  then,  for the purposes of this
                  Section 4.01(a)(ii),  the combined capital and surplus of such

"conflicting  interest"  within  the  meaning  of  Section  310(b)  of the Trust
Indenture Act, the Guarantee Trustee and 

                                   -9-

the Trust Indenture Act.

                  SECTION 4.02 Compensation and Reimbursement.

                  The Guarantor agrees:

                  (a) to pay the  Guarantee  Trustee  from  time  to  time  such
reasonable  compensation  as the Guarantor and the Guarantee  Trustee shall from
time to time agree in writing for all services  rendered by it hereunder  (which
compensation  shall  not be  limited  by any  provision  of law in regard to the
compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

                  (b)  except  as  otherwise   expressly   provided  herein,  to
reimburse the Guarantee  Trustee upon its request for all  reasonable  expenses,
disbursements  and  advances  incurred  or  made  by the  Guarantee  Trustee  in
accordance  with the  provisions of this  Guarantee  (including  the  reasonable
compensation  and expenses of its agents and counsel),  except any such expense,
disbursement  or advance as may be  attributable to its negligence or bad faith;
and

                  (c)  to  indemnify  each  of the  Guarantee  Trustee  and  any
predecessor Guarantee Trustee for, and to hold it harmless from and against, any
and all loss, damage, claim,  liability or expense,  including taxes (other than
taxes  based  upon  the  income  of  the  Guarantee  Trustee)  incurred  without
negligence or bad faith on its part,  arising out of or in  connection  with the
acceptance of the  administration  of this  Guarantee  Agreement,  including the
costs and  expenses  of  defending  itself  against  any claim or  liability  in
connection  with  the  exercise  or  performance  of any its  powers  or  duties
hereunder.

                  As security  for the  performance  of the  obligations  of the
Guarantor under this Section,  the Guarantee  Trustee shall have a lien prior to
the  Preferred  Securities  upon all the property and funds held or collected by
the  Guarantee  Trustee as such,  except  funds held in trust for the payment of
principal of, and premium (if any) or interest on, particular obligations of the
Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement.

                  The  provisions of this Section shall survive the  termination
of this Guarantee Agreement.

                  SECTION 4.03 Appointment, Removal and Resignation of Guarantee
Trustee.

                  (a)  Subject  to Section  4.03(b),  unless an Event of Default

removed without cause at any time by the Guarantor.

                  (b)  The  Guarantee  Trustee  shall  not be  removed  until  a
Successor Guarantee Trustee has been appointed and has accepted such appointment
by written instrument executed by such Successor Guarantee Trustee and delivered
to the Guarantor.

                  (c) The  Guarantee  Trustee  appointed  to office  shall  hold
office until a Successor  Guarantee  Trustee shall have been  appointed or until
its  removal or  resignation.  The  Guarantee  Trustee  may resign  from  office
(without  need for prior or subsequent  accounting)  by an instrument in writing
executed  by  the  Guarantee  Trustee  and  delivered  to the  Guarantor,  which
resignation  shall not take effect until a Successor  Guarantee Trustee has been
appointed and has accepted such appointment by instrument in writing executed by
such  Successor  Guarantee  Trustee  and  delivered  to the  Guarantor  and  the
resigning Guarantee Trustee.

                  (d)  If  no  Successor   Guarantee  Trustee  shall  have  been
appointed  and accepted  appointment  as provided in this Section 4.03 within 60
days after  delivery to the  Guarantor  of an  instrument  of  resignation,  the
resigning Guarantee Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
appointment of a Successor  Guarantee Trustee.  Such court may thereupon,  after
prescribing  such  notice,  if any, as it may deem  proper,  appoint a Successor
Guarantee Trustee.

                  (e) The Guarantor  shall give notice of each  resignation  and
each  removal of the  Guarantee  Trustee  and each  appointment  of a  successor
Guarantee  Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 8.03 hereof.
Each notice shall  include the name of the successor  Guarantee  Trustee and the
address of its Corporate Trust Office.

                               GUARANTEE

                  SECTION  5.01   Guarantee.   The  Guarantor   irrevocably  and
unconditionally  agrees to pay in full to the  Holders  the  Guarantee  Payments
(without  duplication of amounts  theretofore  paid by the Issuer),  as and when
due,  regardless  of any  defense,  right of set-off or  counterclaim  which the
Issuer  may have or  assert.  The  Guarantor's  obligation  to make a  Guarantee
Payment  may be  satisfied  by direct  payment  of the  required  amounts by the
Guarantor  to the  Holders or by causing  the Issuer to pay such  amounts to the
Holders.

                  SECTION 5.02 Waiver of Notice and Demand. The Guarantor hereby
waives notice of acceptance of this Guarantee  Agreement and of any liability to
which it applies or may apply,  presentment,  demand for  payment,  any right to
require a  proceeding  first  against  the  Issuer or any  other  Person  before
proceeding  against the  Guarantor,  protest,  notice of  nonpayment,  notice of

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 5.03  Obligations Not Affected.  The obligation of the
Guarantor to make the Guarantee Payments under this Guarantee Agreement shall in
no way be affected or impaired by reason of the  happening  from time to time of
any of the following:

                  (a) the release or waiver,  by operation of law or  otherwise,
         of the  performance  or  observance  by the  Issuer of any  express  or
         implied  agreement,   covenant,  term  or  condition  relating  to  the
         Preferred Securities to be performed or observed by the Issuer;

                  (b) the extension of time for the payment by the Issuer of all
         or any  portion of the  Distributions,  Redemption  Price,  Liquidation
         Distribution or any other sums payable under the terms of the Preferred
         Securities  or the extension of time for the  performance  of any other
         obligation under,  arising out of, or in connection with, the Preferred
         Securities   (other   than  an   extension   of  time  for  payment  of
         Distributions,  Redemption Price, Liquidation Distribution or other sum
         payable that results from the extension of any interest  payment period
         on the Debentures permitted by the Indenture);

                  (c) any failure,  omission,  delay or lack of diligence on the
         part  of  the  Holders  to  enforce,  assert  or  exercise  any  right,
         privilege,  power or remedy  conferred  on the Holders  pursuant to the
         terms of the  Preferred  Securities,  or any  action on the part of the
         Issuer granting indulgence or extension of any kind;

                  (d) the  voluntary or  involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution,
         sale  of  any   collateral,   receivership,   insolvency,   bankruptcy,
         assignment for the benefit of creditors,  reorganization,  arrangement,
         composition or  readjustment  of debt of, or other similar  proceedings
         affecting, the Issuer or any of the assets of the Issuer;

                  (e)  any invalidity of, or defect or deficiency in, the 
         Preferred Securities;

                  (f)  the settlement or compromise of any obligation guaranteed
          hereby or hereby incurred; or

                  (g) any other  circumstance  whatsoever  that might  otherwise
         constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor, it
         being the  intent of this  Section  5.03  that the  obligations  of the
         Guarantor  hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional  under any and
         all circumstances.

There shall be no obligation of the Holders to give notice to, or obtain consent
of, the Guarantor with respect to the happening of any of the foregoing.

                  SECTION  5.04  Rights  of  Holders.  The  Guarantor  expressly

Guarantee Trustee to be held for the benefit of the Holders;  (ii) the Guarantee
Trustee  has the right to  enforce  this  

                                   -12-

Guarantee Agreement on behalf of the Holders; (iii) the Holders of a Majority in
liquidation  amount of the  Preferred  Securities  have the right to direct  the
time,  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Guarantee  Trustee in respect of this Guarantee  Agreement or exercising any
trust or power  conferred  upon  the  Guarantee  Trustee  under  this  Guarantee
Agreement; and (iv) any Holder may institute a legal proceeding directly against
the Guarantor to enforce its rights under this Guarantee Agreement without first
instituting a legal proceeding against the Issuer or any other person or entity.

                  SECTION 5.05 Guarantee of Payment.  This  Guarantee  Agreement
creates a guarantee of payment and not of collection.  This Guarantee  Agreement
will not be  discharged  except by payment  of the  Guarantee  Payments  in full
(without duplication).

                  SECTION 5.06 Subrogation. The Guarantor shall be subrogated to
all (if any) rights of the Holders  against the Issuer in respect of any amounts
paid to the Holders by the Guarantor under this Guarantee  Agreement;  provided,
however,  that the  Guarantor  shall  not  (except  to the  extent  required  by
mandatory provisions of law) be entitled to enforce or exercise any rights which
it may acquire by way of subrogation or any  indemnity,  reimbursement  or other
agreement,  in all cases as a result of payment under this Guarantee  Agreement,
if, at the time of any such payment,  any amounts of Guarantee  Payments are due
and unpaid under this  Guarantee  Agreement.  If any amount shall be paid to the
Guarantor in violation of the preceding  sentence,  the Guarantor agrees to hold
such amount in trust for the Holders and to pay over such amount to the Holders.

                  SECTION   5.07   Independent   Obligations.    The   Guarantor
acknowledges  that its obligations  hereunder are independent of the obligations
of the Issuer with respect to the  Preferred  Securities  and that the Guarantor
shall be liable as principal and as debtor hereunder to make Guarantee  Payments
pursuant to the terms of this Guarantee Agreement notwithstanding the occurrence
of any event referred to in subsections (a) through (g),  inclusive,  of Section
5.03.


                                  ARTICLE VI

                                SUBORDINATION

                  SECTION 6.01  Subordination.  This  Guarantee  Agreement  will
constitute  an  unsecured   obligation  of  the  Guarantor  and  will  rank  (i)
subordinate  and  junior in right of  payment  to all other  liabilities  of the
Guarantor, including the Debentures, except those made pari passu or subordinate
by their terms,  (ii) pari passu with the most senior  preferred  or  preference
stock now or hereafter  issued by the  Guarantor  and with any  guarantee now or
hereafter  entered  into  by  the  Guarantor  in  respect  of any  preferred  or
preference  stock of any  Affiliate  of the  Guarantor,  and (iii) senior to all
common  stock of the  Guarantor.  Nothing in

                                   -13-

this  Section  6.01 shall  apply to claims  of, or  payments  to, the  Guarantee

                  SECTION  7.01  Termination.  This  Guarantee  Agreement  shall
terminate  and be of no further  force and effect upon:  (i) full payment of the
Redemption  Price  of all  Preferred  Securities,  and all  accrued  and  unpaid
Distributions to the date of redemption,  (ii) the distribution of Debentures to
Holders in exchange for all of the Preferred Securities or (iii) full payment of
the amounts payable in accordance  with the Trust Agreement upon  liquidation of
the  Issuer.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  Guarantee  Agreement  will
continue to be  effective or will be  reinstated,  as the case may be, if at any
time any  Holder  must  restore  payment  of any sums paid with  respect  to the
Preferred Securities or under this Guarantee Agreement.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

agreements  contained in this  Guarantee  Agreement  shall bind the  successors,
assigns,  receivers,  trustees and  representatives  of the  Guarantor and shall

Guarantee  Trustee.  Except with respect to any changes which do not  materially
adversely affect the rights of Holders (in which case no consent of Holders will
be  required),  this  Guarantee  Agreement  may only be  amended  with the prior
approval of the Holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate liquidation amount
of all the outstanding Preferred Securities. The provisions of Article VI of the
Trust Agreement concerning meetings of Holders shall apply to the giving of such
approval. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require that the Guarantee
Trustee enter into any amendment of this Guarantee Agreement.

communication  required or permitted to be given  hereunder shall be in writing,

                    AGREEMENT AS TO EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES

                  AGREEMENT dated as of March 20, 1996,  between Minnesota Power
& Light Company, a Minnesota  corporation  ("Minnesota Power"), and MP&L Capital
I, a Delaware business trust (the "Trust").

                  WHEREAS, the Trust intends to issue its Common Securities (the
"Common Securities") to and receive Debentures from Minnesota Power and to issue
its 8.05% Quarterly  Income  Preferred  Securities (the "Preferred  Securities")
with such powers,  preferences  and special rights and  restrictions  as are set
forth in the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust dated as of March
1, 1996 as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Trust Agreement");

                  WHEREAS, Minnesota Power is the issuer of the Debentures;

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the acceptance by each
holder of the Preferred  Securities,  which  acceptance  Minnesota  Power hereby
agrees  shall  benefit  Minnesota  Power and which  acceptance  Minnesota  Power
acknowledges  will be made in reliance  upon the  execution and delivery of this
Agreement,  Minnesota  Power,  including in its capacity as holder of the Common
Securities, and the Trust hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                  Section 1.01.  Assumption by Minnesota  Power.  Subject to the
terms  and  conditions   hereof,   Minnesota   Power  hereby   irrevocably   and
unconditionally  assumes  the  full  payment,  when  and as due,  of any and all
Obligations (as hereinafter  defined) to each person or entity to whom the Trust
is now or hereafter  becomes indebted or liable (the  "Beneficiaries").  As used
herein,  "Obligations"  means any  indebtedness,  expenses or liabilities of the
Trust,  other  than  (i)  obligations  of the  Trust  to pay to  holders  of any
Preferred  Securities  or other  similar  interests in the Trust the amounts due
such holders  pursuant to the terms of the  Preferred  Securities  or such other
similar  interests,  as the case may be and (ii) obligations  arising out of the
negligence,  willful  misconduct or bad faith of the Trustees of the Trust. This
Agreement  is intended to be for the benefit of, and to be  enforceable  by, all
such  Beneficiaries,  whether or not such  Beneficiaries  have  received  notice
hereof.

                  Section  1.02.   Term  of  Agreement.   This  Agreement  shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the date on which there are
no  Beneficiaries  remaining;  provided,  however,  that  this  Agreement  shall
continue to be effective or shall be  reinstated,  as the case may be, if at any
time any holder of Preferred  Securities or any Beneficiary must restore payment
of any sums paid under the Preferred Securities, under any Obligation, under the
Guarantee Agreement dated the date hereof by Minnesota Power and The Bank of New
York, as guarantee  trustee,  or under this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.
This Agreement is continuing, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute.

<PAGE>

                  Section 1.03. Waiver of Notice.  Minnesota Power hereby waives
notice of acceptance of this Agreement and of any Obligation to which it applies
or may apply, and Minnesota Power hereby waives presentment, demand for payment,
protest, notice of nonpayment,  notice of dishonor, notice of redemption and all
other notices and demands.

                  Section  1.04.  No  Impairment.  The  obligations,  covenants,
agreements and duties of Minnesota Power under this Agreement shall in no way be
affected or impaired by reason of the happening  from time to time of any of the
following:

                  (a) the  extension of time for the payment by the Trust of all
or any portion of the Obligations or for the performance of any other obligation
under, arising out of, or in connection with, the Obligations;

                  (b) any failure,  omission,  delay or lack of diligence on the
part of the Beneficiaries to enforce,  assert or exercise any right,  privilege,
power or remedy conferred on the  Beneficiaries  with respect to the Obligations
or any action on the part of the Trust  granting  indulgence or extension of any
kind; or

                  (c) the  voluntary or  involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution,
sale of any collateral, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the
benefit of creditors,  reorganization,  arrangement, composition or readjustment
of debt of,  or other  similar  proceedings  affecting,  the Trust or any of the
assets of the Trust.

There shall be no obligation of the  Beneficiaries  to give notice to, or obtain
the consent of,  Minnesota  Power with  respect to the  happening  of any of the
foregoing.

                  Section  1.05.  Enforcement.  A  Beneficiary  may enforce this
Agreement  directly against Minnesota Power and Minnesota Power waives any right
or remedy to require  that any action be brought  against the Trust or any other
person or entity before proceeding against Minnesota Power.


                                   ARTICLE II

                  Section 2.01.  Binding  Effect.  All guarantees and agreements

Beneficiary  or any  Preferred  Securities of any series are  outstanding,  this
Agreement  shall not be  modified  or  amended  in any  manner  adverse  to such
Beneficiary or to the holders of the Preferred Securities.
