                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  we are  hereby  filing  cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause our actual  results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q, in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"   "projects,"   "will  likely   result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

  -  war and acts of terrorism;

  -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of
     the United States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the FERC, the MPUC, the
     FPSC, the NCUC, the PSCW and various county regulators, about allowed rates
     of  return,  financings,  industry  and  rate  structure,  acquisition  and
     disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation  and  construction  of plant
     facilities,  recovery  of  purchased  power and  capital  investments,  and
     present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including but not
     limited to  transmission  costs) as well as general  vehicle-related  laws,
     including vehicle brokerage and auction laws;

  -  unanticipated impacts of restructuring initiatives in the electric
     industry;

  -  economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;

  -  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;

  -  weather conditions;

  -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;

  -  the effects of competition, including the competition for retail and
     wholesale customers, as well as suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;

  -  pricing and transportation of commodities;

  -  market demand, including structural market changes;

  -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

  -  unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;

  -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

  -  capital market conditions;

  -  competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;

  -  our ability to manage expansion and integrate recent acquisitions; and

  -  legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and
     settlements that affect the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of these  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of these
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be
read in  conjunction  with our 2001 Form 10-K.  In our opinion  all  adjustments
necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim  periods have been
included.  The results of operations  for an interim  period may not give a true
indication of results for the year. The financial  information for prior periods
has been  reclassified  to  reflect  the  discontinuance  of our Water  Services
businesses,   our  auto   transport   business-Great   Rigs,   and  our   retail
business-Electric Odyssey.

NOTE 2.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In September 2001 we began a process of systematically evaluating our businesses
to determine the  strategic  value of our assets and explore ways to unlock that
value.  As a result,  our  management and Board of Directors have committed to a
plan to sell our Water  Services  businesses  and our auto  transport  business.
Water Services includes water and wastewater services operated by several wholly
owned subsidiaries in Florida, North Carolina and Georgia. We anticipate selling
our Water Services  businesses  before the end of 2002. During the first quarter
of 2002 we exited our  nonregulated  water  subsidiaries.  We expect to exit the
auto  transport  business  during the second  quarter  2002. We will continue to
incur  operating  losses  until we sell those  assets.  We have also  completely
exited the Electric Odyssey, our retail business.  The financial results for all
of these  businesses  have been  accounted for as  discontinued  operations.  In
accordance  with SFAS 144,  we ceased  depreciation  of assets  related to these
businesses in the fourth quarter of 2001.

NOTE 6.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS  143,   "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement   Obligations,"   requires  the
recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in
which it is incurred.  When the  liability is initially  recorded,  the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time,
the  liability  is  accreted to its  present  value and the related  capitalized
charge is depreciated  over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective
for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  Currently,  decommissioning
amounts  collected  in  Minnesota  Power's  rates are  reported  in  accumulated
depreciation.  We are  reviewing  what  additional  assets,  if  any,  may  have
associated retirement costs as defined by SFAS 143.


NOTE 7.    SQUARE BUTTE POWER PURCHASED CONTRACT

Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase  agreement with Square Butte that extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in our electric service  territory and enables Minnesota Power to meet
power pool  reserve  requirements.  Square  Butte,  a North  Dakota  cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-MW coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center, North
Dakota.  The Unit is  adjacent  to a  generating  unit owned by  Minnkota  Power
Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative corporation whose Class
A members are also members of Square Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of
the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's  output
under the  Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance
notice  requirement,  Minnkota  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  Minnesota Power
is  obligated  to pay its pro  rata  share  of  Square  Butte's  costs  based on
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to  Unit  output.   Minnesota  Power's  payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service. At March 31, 2002 Square Butte had total debt
outstanding  of $299.1  million.  Total  annual debt service for Square Butte is
expected to be approximately $36 million in each of the years 2002 and 2003, and
$23 million in each of the years 2004 through  2006.  Variable  operating  costs
include the price of coal purchased from BNI Coal, Ltd., our subsidiary, under a
long-term  contract.  Minnesota Power's payments to Square Butte are approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

per share  were  down 4 percent  over the same  period of 2001.  Excluding  $2.3
million,  or $0.02 per share, of charges related to our exit from  non-strategic
businesses,  earnings per share for the quarter  ended March 31, 2002 would have
been $0.46.  Earnings for 2001  included $2.8  million,  or $0.04 per share,  of
goodwill  amortization expense. The issuance of 6.6 million shares of our common
stock in the second quarter of 2001 also impacted earnings per share for 2002.

NET INCOME

ENERGY  SERVICES'  net income in 2002  decreased  $3.3  million,  or 27 percent,
primarily  due to weaker  wholesale  market  conditions.  Last  year's  stronger
economy and colder winter weather  resulted in higher  wholesale  prices.  Total
retail megawatthour sales were similar to last year.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  reported a $6.6  million,  or 36 percent,  increase in net
income and a 6 percent  increase in EBITDAL over 2001.  The continued  growth in
net  income  was  primarily  due  to  higher  conversion  rates,  improved  cost
efficiencies,  a mandated accounting change related to goodwill amortization and
lower interest rates.  The conversion rate (the percentage of vehicles sold from
those that were offered at auction)  related to wholesale  vehicles  sold was 66
percent for the quarter  ended March 31, 2002 (64 percent for the same period in
2001). In 2002 vehicles sold at our wholesale auction facilities were similar to
last year.  Fleet  downsizing by rental car companies  after  September 11, 2001
resulted in increased sales of factory vehicles at our auction facilities during
the  fourth  quarter  of 2001 to the  detriment  of the first  quarter  of 2002.
Vehicle sales in other higher margin  categories had strong  conversion rates in
2002 and helped  mitigate the reduction in sales of factory  vehicles.  Vehicles
sold at our total loss vehicle auction  facilities were up 37 percent from 2001.
AFC contributed 30 percent of the net income for Automotive Services in 2002 (36
percent in 2001) and  reported a 7 percent  increase  in the number of  vehicles
financed.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE  CHARGES reported lower net income in 2002 due in part
to lower returns on our securities portfolio. Our securities portfolio earned an
after-tax  annualized  return of 3.08  percent in 2002 (10.32  percent in 2001).
This decrease was  partially  offset by larger real estate sales and more income
from our emerging technology investments.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS was down $0.4 million  reflecting  $2.3 million of exit
charges  associated with Great Rigs and the Electric Odyssey.  This decrease was
partially  offset  by a $1.8  million  increase  in net  income  from our  Water
Services businesses primarily due to the suspension of depreciation.


COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2002 AND 2001

ENERGY SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was down $16.1 million,  or 10 percent,  in 2002. Revenue from
wholesale  power  marketing  and  trading  activities  decreased  $11.3  million
primarily due to weak wholesale  market  conditions as a result of warmer winter
weather  in 2002.  Revenue  from  retail  electric  and gas sales was down $10.9
million in 2002 reflecting  warmer winter weather,  lower fuel clause recoveries
and lower industrial  revenue.  Total retail  megawatthour sales were similar to
last year.  These 2002  decreases  were  partially  offset by $4.6  million more
revenue from Enventis Telecom  reflecting the July 2001 acquisition of Enventis,
Inc.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in both 2002 and 2001.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both
2002 and  2001.  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 4  percent  of
consolidated operating revenue in 2002 (7 percent in 2001).

OPERATING  EXPENSES were down $10.6 million,  or 8 percent,  in 2002.  Purchased
power expense was down $14.4 million in 2002 because  Company  generation was up
10 percent and 7 percent fewer  megawatthours  were sold.  Purchased gas expense
was lower in 2002  because  in 2001  prices  paid were at  record  highs.  These
decreases were partially offset by the inclusion of Enventis, Inc. operations.

<PAGE>
AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $8.6 million,  or 4 percent,  in 2002 reflecting strong
conversion rates at wholesale auction  facilities.  At ADESA,  461,000 wholesale
vehicles were sold in 2002  (465,000 in 2001).  Vehicles sold were impacted by a
reduction  in factory  vehicles  brought  to  auction.  Stronger  sales in other
vehicle  categories  helped  mitigate  the  reduction  in factory  vehicles.  In
addition,  at our total loss vehicle  auctions 48,000 vehicles were sold in 2002
(35,000 in 2001), an increase of 37 percent.

Operating revenue from AFC was higher in 2002 reflecting a 7 percent increase in
vehicles   financed   through  its  loan   production   offices.   AFC  financed
approximately  237,000  vehicles in 2002  (221,000  in 2001) and  managed  total
receivables of $500 million at March 31, 2002 ($497 million at March 31, 2001).

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $1.5 million,  or 1 percent,  in 2002 primarily due
to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization ($3.3 million),  reduced interest
expense  ($4.9  million) as a result of lower  interest  rates and improved cost
efficiencies.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating
expenses  incurred  to  standardize  operations  at all our total  loss  auction
facilities  and  expenditures  for  information  technology  initiatives.  Also,
operating expenses in 2001 reflected  additional  expenses for utility and labor
costs incurred as a result of inclement weather conditions.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $3.6 million,  or 28 percent, in 2002 due to the timing
of sales  related to our real  estate  operations  and our  emerging  technology
investments.  Two large real estate  sales in 2002  contributed  $4.9 million to
revenue,  while in 2001 two large real estate sales  contributed $2.6 million to
revenue. Operating revenue included $3.3 million of gains on the sale of certain
emerging  technology  investments in 2002. These increases were partially offset
by less income from the securities portfolio due to lower returns in 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES were up $4.2 million, or 33 percent, in 2002 primarily due to
larger real estate sales and additional interest expense.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Certain accounting  measurements under applicable  generally accepted accounting
principles involve management's judgment about subjective factors and estimates,
the effects of which are inherently  uncertain.  The following  summarizes those
accounting  measurements we believe are most critical to our reported results of
operations and financial condition.

OUTLOOK

We continue to expect  earnings per share will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.17
for 2002,  excluding  any gain  from the  expected  sale of our  Water  Services
assets.  This 14 percent to 16 percent  increase in earnings  per share for 2002
incorporates  the  goodwill  accounting  change.  The  cash  generated  from our
operating  results and the expected sale of our Water Services  assets will fuel
our future growth.  We will focus on our two core  competencies-Energy  Services
and Automotive  Services,  and work toward  positioning each of them to continue
our earnings growth track record.

ENERGY  SERVICES.  Our new merchant  generation  facilities  at Taconite  Harbor
Energy Center in northern Minnesota, and Kendall County near Chicago,  Illinois,
are expected to be fully operational by the second quarter of 2002.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  We expect to see continued EBITDAL and revenue improvement
from our auctions  acquired  since  January  2000.  In addition,  we  anticipate
continued  growth in the number of vehicles  sold and  financed  at auction.  As
previously  disclosed,  we  expect  30  percent  earnings  growth  over 2001 for
Automotive Services-including the goodwill accounting change. We also expect a 5
percent  increase in total  vehicles sold and a 13 percent  increase in vehicles
financed over 2001.  This quarter we acquired a large total loss vehicle auction
facility and have made progress on integrating  total loss vehicle auctions into
some of our wholesale auction facilities.

INVESTMENTS  AND CORPORATE  CHARGES.  We continue to anticipate  net income from
Investments  and Corporate  Charges to remain stable in 2002. An expected  lower
contribution  from our real estate operations should be offset by better returns
from our emerging  technology  investments and securities  portfolio,  and lower
corporate charges.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS.  Negotiations  for  the  sale  of our  auto  transport
business are still in progress and we expect to  completely  exit that  business
during the second  quarter of 2002. We will continue to incur  operating  losses
until we sell the assets.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES

During the first  quarter  of 2002 cash flow from  operations  reflected  strong
operating results and continued focus on working capital  management.  Cash flow
from  operations  was  higher  in 2002 due to the  timing of the  collection  of
certain  finance  receivables  outstanding at December 31, 2001.  Cash flow from
operations  was also  affected by a number of factors  representative  of normal
operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper.  Our  securities  investments  can be
liquidated  to  provide  funds  for  reinvestment  in  existing   businesses  or
acquisition of new businesses.  Approximately  5.1 million original issue shares
of our common stock are available for issuance through INVEST DIRECT, our direct
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided.  However, ADESA has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for dealers to purchase  vehicles at
auctions in exchange for a security interest in those vehicles. The financing is
provided  through  the  earlier  of the date the dealer  sells the  vehicle or a
general  borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC has  arrangements  to use proceeds
from the sale of  commercial  paper  issued by  ALLETE  to meet its  operational
requirements.

                      ALLETE First Quarter 2002 Form 10-Q                     14
<PAGE>
At March 31, 2002  approximately  91 percent of AFC's finance  receivables  were
securitized  (81  percent at  December  31,  2001).  AFC sells  certain  finance
receivables on a revolving  basis to a wholly owned,  unconsolidated,  qualified
special purpose subsidiary. This subsidiary in turn sells, on a revolving basis,
an undivided  interest in eligible finance  receivables,  up to a maximum at any
one time  outstanding  of $325  million,  to  third  party  purchasers  under an
agreement that expires at the end of 2002. At March 31, 2002 AFC had sold $437.8
million of finance receivables to the special purpose subsidiary ($381.2 million
at December  31,  2001).  Third party  purchasers  had  purchased  an  undivided
interest in finance  receivables of $307.0 million from this subsidiary at March
31, 2002 ($267.0 million at December 31, 2001).  Unsold finance receivables held
by the special  purpose  subsidiary are recorded by AFC as residual  interest at
fair value.  Fair value is based upon  estimates  of future  cash  flows,  using
assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use to value  such  instruments,
including   estimates  of  anticipated  credit  losses  over  the  life  of  the
receivables  sold without  application  of a discount rate due to the short-term
nature of the  receivables  sold. The fair value of AFC's residual  interest was
$118.3 million at March 31, 2002 ($103.0 million at December 31, 2001). Proceeds
from the sale of the receivables  were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.  AFC must maintain certain
financial  covenants such as minimum tangible net worth to comply with the terms
of the securitization agreement.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
March 31, 2002  compared to December  31, 2001 were due to  increased  sales and
financing  activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down
during the winter months and in December  because of the holidays.  As a result,
ADESA had higher receivables and higher payables at March 31, 2002.

We provide up to $50 million in credit support to facilitate the power marketing
and  trading  activities  of  Split  Rock  Energy,  and  had  $30.3  million  in
outstanding support at March 31, 2002 ($36.0 million at December 31, 2001).

SECURITIES.  In March 2001  ALLETE,  ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE  Capital III,
jointly filed a  registration  statement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement,  which has been declared
effective by the SEC, relates to the possible issuance of an aggregate amount of
$500 million of securities which may include ALLETE common stock, first mortgage
bonds and other debt  securities,  and ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE Capital III
preferred  trust  securities,   of  which  approximately  $387  million  remains
available to be issued.  ALLETE also previously filed a registration  statement,
which has been declared  effective by the SEC, relating to the possible issuance
of $25 million of first  mortgage bonds and other debt  securities.  We may sell
all or a portion of the remaining  registered  securities if warranted by market
conditions  and our  capital  requirements.  Any  offer  and  sale of the  above
mentioned  securities  will be made only by means of a  prospectus  meeting  the
requirements  of the  Securities  Act of 1933  and  the  rules  and  regulations
thereunder.

INVESTMENTS.  As companies included in our emerging  technology  investments are
sold, we will  recognize a gain or loss.  Our  investment in the companies  that
have gone public had a cost basis of approximately $12 million at March 31, 2002
and December 31, 2001.  The  aggregate  market value of our  investment in these
companies at March 31, 2002 was $15 million ($24 million at December 31,  2001).
These investments provide us with access to developing technologies before their
commercial  debut, as well as potential  financial  returns and  diversification
opportunities. We view these investments as a source of capital for redeployment
in existing businesses.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 totaled
$46.9 million  ($24.6  million in 2001).  Expenditures  for 2002 included  $20.6
million  for  Energy  Services  and  $10.6  million  for  Automotive   Services.
Expenditures  for 2002 also  included  $15.7  million  related  to  discontinued
operations  ($11.8 million to maintain our Water Services  businesses while they
are in the process of being sold;  $3.9  million to buy  previously  leased auto
transportation  trucks).  Internally generated funds were the primary sources of
funding for these expenditures.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS  143,   "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement   Obligations,"   requires  the
recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in
which it is incurred.  When the  liability is initially  recorded,  the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time,
the  liability  is  accreted to its  present  value and the related  capitalized
charge is depreciated  over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective
for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  Currently,  decommissioning
amounts  collected  in  Minnesota  Power's  rates are  reported  in  accumulated
depreciation.  We are  reviewing  what  additional  assets,  if  any,  may  have
associated retirement costs as defined by SFAS 143.

Investments  held  principally  for  near-term  sale are  classified  as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies.  In strategies  designed to hedge
overall market risks, we also sell common stock short.  Investments  held for an
indefinite  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale  securities and
also  recorded at fair value.  At March 31, 2002  available-for-sale  securities
consisted of the common stock of publicly traded companies and equity securities
in a grantor trust established to fund certain employee benefits.

                                                  MARCH 31,      DECEMBER 31,

FOREIGN CURRENCY

Our foreign currency  exposure is limited to the conversion of operating results
of our  Canadian  subsidiaries  and,  therefore,  we have not  entered  into any
foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge the  conversion of our Canadian  operating
results into United States dollars.

POWER MARKETING AND TRADING

Minnesota Power purchases power for retail sales in our retail service territory
and occasionally  sells excess generation in the wholesale market.  The services
of Split Rock Energy are used to fulfill  purchase  requirements for retail load
and market excess generation.

By the  second  quarter  of 2002  we  expect  to  have up to 500 MW of  merchant
generation (non-rate base generation sold at market-based rates pursuant to FERC
authority)  available for sale to the wholesale market.  This includes 225 MW of
generation at our Taconite  Harbor Energy Center in northern  Minnesota that was
acquired in October 2001. Also included are 275 MW of generation secured through
a 15-year tolling  agreement,  which commenced in May 2002, with NRG Energy at a
facility near Chicago, Illinois. Under the tolling agreement, the Company pays a
fixed capacity charge for the right, but not the obligation,  to utilize one 275
MW generating unit. We are responsible for arranging the natural gas fuel supply
and are entitled to the electricity produced.

Our strategy is to sell the majority of merchant  generation  through  long-term
contracts  of various  durations.  The balance  will be sold in the spot market,
through  short-term  agreements,  or  possibly  utilized as a source of low-cost
supply for our regulated  operations  if the need exists.  The services of Split
Rock  Energy  may be  utilized  to  broker  or market  merchant  generation.  We
currently have two long-term  forward capacity and energy  contracts  related to
generation secured by the NRG Energy tolling agreement.  Each is for 50 MW, with
one having a 10-year term and the other a 15-year term.

We own 50 percent of Split Rock Energy which was formed in 2000 with Great River
Energy to combine power supply assets and customer loads for power marketing and
trading,  power-pool  operations and generation  outage  protection.  Split Rock
Energy  operates  in the  wholesale  energy  markets,  and  engages  in  trading
activities  by entering  into forward and option  contracts for the purchase and
sale of  electricity.  These  contracts are generally  short-term in nature with
maturities of less than one year.  Although Split Rock Energy generally attempts
to balance its  purchase  and sale  positions,  commodity  price risk  sometimes
exists or is created.  This risk is actively  managed  through a risk management
program that includes  policies,  procedures and limits established by the Split
Rock Energy Board of Governors.  Split Rock Energy's open trading contracts were
not significant at March 31, 2002 and had a fair value of $49,000.

As required by statute,  the Florida  Governmental  Utilities  Authority  (FGUA)
convened a public hearing on May 2, 2002 to obtain input on the FGUA's  proposed
acquisition  of the assets of Florida  Water.  Due to  concerns  raised by local
governmental  units  representing  areas served by Florida Water,  the FGUA will
reconvene the public hearing on May 16, 2002, and has advised Florida Water that
it will work with  these  local  governments  through  June 2002 in an effort to
obtain their support. It is then the FGUA's intent to advise Florida Water which
utility  systems  it  desires  to  purchase  and  seek  to  finalize  definitive
agreements.  Certain  local  governmental  units have  indicated  an interest in
buying  utility  systems directly from Florida  Water.  Although the  period for
exclusive  dealing  with the FGUA  will  lapse on May 14,  2002,  Florida  Water
expects to continue its cooperation with FGUA due diligence efforts.

On March 18, 2002  Potlatch  Corporation  (Potlatch)  announced  the sale of its
Cloquet pulp and paper mill to South Africa-based  Sappi Ltd. (Sappi).  The sale
is subject to customary closing conditions,  including regulatory approvals, and
is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2002.  Minnesota Power will
continue to serve the Cloquet facility after the sale. Negotiations are underway
between Potlatch, Sappi and Minnesota Power to disaggregate the current Potlatch
Electric Service  Agreement that provides  Potlatch a combined bill for electric
usage at its Cloquet, Brainerd and Grand Rapids facilities.

In  conjunction  with the sale of the  Cloquet  mill,  Potlatch  will  close its
Brainerd paper mill.  Potlatch is looking for another  operator for the Brainerd
plant,  which can no longer be used to produce coated paper, which would compete
with the Cloquet mill.  Potlatch's Grand Rapids  strandboard plant will continue
to operate and be served by Minnesota Power.
