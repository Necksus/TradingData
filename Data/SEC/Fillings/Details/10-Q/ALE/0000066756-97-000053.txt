Note 2.   Regulatory Matters

FPSC Refund Order in  Connection  with 1991 Rate Case.  Responding  to a Florida
Supreme Court  decision  addressing  the issue of  retroactive  ratemaking  with
respect  to another  company,  in March  1996 the FPSC  voted to  reconsider  an
October 1995 order  (Refund  Order) which would have  required  Florida Water to
refund about $15 million,  which includes  interest,  to customers who paid more
since  October  1993  under  uniform  rates  than they  would  have  paid  under
stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order, the collection through a surcharge of
the $15  million  from  customers  who paid  less  under  uniform  rates was not
permitted.  The Refund Order was in response to the Florida First District Court
of  Appeals  (Court of  Appeals)  reversal  in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order
which  imposed  uniform  rates  for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in
Florida.  With "uniform  rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the
same rates for water and wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative
to  "stand-alone"  rates which are calculated  based on the cost of serving each
service area.  The FPSC  reconsidered  the Refund Order,  but in August 1996 the
FPSC issued an order  upholding by a 3 to 2 vote its  decision to order  refunds
without  offsetting  surcharges.  Florida Water filed an appeal of this decision
with the Court of Appeals.  

On June 17, 1997 the Court of Appeals reversed the FPSC's August 1996 order. The
Court of Appeals  determined  that the FPSC's order directing the refund without
permitting  an  offsetting  surcharge  was not  permissible  because  it did not
comport  with  principles  of  equity or with  existing  Florida  Supreme  Court
precedent.  The  Court  of  Appeals  remanded  the  matter  back to the FPSC for
reconsideration,  and  directed the FPSC to consider  requests for  intervention
from the various  customer  groups  impacted by any  potential  surcharges.  The
issues to be  considered  on remand relate to rate design and do not involve any
adjustment to Florida Water's revenue requirement.  The Company has not recorded
a provision  for refund in connection  with this case.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.


Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1 million rate
increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers of Florida  Water
regulated  by the FPSC.  On October  30, 1996 the FPSC issued its final order in
the  Florida  Water  rate case.  The new rates,  which  became  effective  as of
September  20,  1996,   resulted  in  an  annualized   increase  in  revenue  of
approximately $11.1 million. This increase included, and was not in addition to,
the $7.9  million  increase  in  annualized  revenue  granted as  interim  rates
effective on January 23, 1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate  structure  called
"capband," which replaces uniform rates. With capband rates,  areas with similar
cost of  service  are  grouped  into  one of a  number  of rate  bands,  and all
customers  within a given band are charged the same rate. This rate structure is
designed so that a  customer's  bill will not exceed a certain  "cap" unless the
customer's  usage  exceeds an assumed  level.  On November 1, 1996 Florida Water
filed  with the Court of Appeals an appeal of the  FPSC's  final  order  seeking
judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in  utility
facilities  recoverable  in rates from current  customers.  Other parties to the
rate case also  filed  appeals  with the Court of Appeals  regarding  the FPSC's
final order. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

Effective June 13, 1997 Florida Water resumed collecting  pre-existing Allowance
for Funds  Prudently  Invested  (AFPI)  charges.  AFPI  represents  the  accrued
carrying cost of certain  non-used and useful  property  excluded from rate base
and is  collected  as a  one-time  charge to  certain  new water and  wastewater
customers.  The recovery of AFPI charges at certain  Florida Water service areas
was reduced or  eliminated  in the FPSC's  October  1996 final  order  issued in
connection with Florida  Water's 1995 rate case. In April 1997 the FPSC,  acting
on Florida Water's  motion,  allowed  recovery of pre-existing  AFPI charges for
these service areas,  subject to refund with interest in the event of an adverse
court  ruling in the  appeal  of the 1995 rate  case.  Florida  Water  estimates
approximately  $1 million,  on an annual basis,  will be collected and accounted
for as deferred revenue pending results of the appeal.

Hernando  County Rates.  As required by Hernando County, on April 14, 1997
Florida Water filed for a rate change with the Hernando  County  Board of 
Commissioners.  Florida  Water filed for an annual  interim  rate  reduction of
$258,780  (-3.3  percent)  and a final rate increase of $123,897  (1.6 percent).
On June 14, 1997 the final rate  increase Florida  Water  requested  became
effective  automatically  by  operation of law because Hernando County failed to
take action on the rates within the prescribed statutory period.

Note 2.   Regulatory Matters (Continued)

In July 1997 Florida Water reached a settlement  agreement with Hernando  County
regarding  the rate  case  Florida  Water  filed in April  1997.  Under the
settlement  agreement,  new rates will be effective September  1, 1997 and are 
expected to result in $6.3 million of revenue on an annual basis, a $1.6 million
decrease from current revenue levels implemented on June 14, 1997.  Rates will
then be  increased  January 1, 1999 to result in $7.2 million in revenue on an
annual basis. Florida Water has also agreed not to file for new rates with
Hernando  County prior to September  2000. All litigation was dismissed by both
parties.

Florida Water's settlement  agreement with Hernando County supersedes the FPSC's
February  14,  1997  order  which  required  Florida  Water to  charge  rates to
customers in Hernando County based on a modified stand-alone rate structure.

Hillsborough County Rates. On July 2, 1997 Florida Water filed for a rate change
with the Hillsborough  County Utilities  Department.  Florida Water filed for an
annual  interim  rate  increase  of  $848,845  (43.1  percent)  and a final rate
increase of $877,607  (44.6  percent).  Interim rates are  anticipated to become
effective 45 days from the date of the filing.  The Company is unable to predict
the outcome of this case.

Index  Filings.  In July 1997  Florida  Water filed two index  filings  which if
approved  will  increase  revenue by $436,000.  Approval is expected on or about
October 1, 1997.  Under Florida law water and  wastewater  utilities may make an
annual index  filing  designed to recover  inflationary  costs  associated  with
operation and maintenance expense.


Note 3.   Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. Under
the terms of the contract which extends  through 2007, the Company is purchasing
71 percent of the output from a generating  plant which is capable of generating
up to 470 MW.  Reductions  to about 49 percent of the output are provided for in
the contract and, at the option of Square  Butte,  could begin after a five-year
advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power  and  energy is a  proportionate  share of Square  Butte's
fixed obligations and variable  operating costs,  based on the percentage of the
total  output  purchased by the Company.  The annual  fixed  obligations  of the
Company to Square Butte are $20.1 million from 1997 through  2001.  The variable
operating costs are not incurred unless  production  takes place. The Company is
responsible  for paying all costs and  expenses  of Square  Butte if not paid by
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company are
absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered to the
Company.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
           Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota  Power  has  operations  in  four  business  segments:   (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
services,  which include water and wastewater services; (3) automotive services,
which include auctions, a finance company and an auto transport company; and (4)
investments,   which  include  a  securities  portfolio,  a  21  percent  equity
investment  in  a  financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and  real  estate
operations.

Earnings per share of common  stock for the quarter  ended June 30, 1997 were 60
cents  compared to 49 cents for the  quarter  ended June 30,  1996.  Significant
increases  from electric  operations  and  automotive  services were the primary
contributors  to  higher  earnings  in  1997.   Higher  earnings  from  electric
operations  include  compensation  from  the  Company's  sale of its  rights  to
microwave  frequencies  and  property  tax relief  from the State of  Minnesota.
Automotive  services  earnings  are higher due to a 28 percent  increase  in the
number of cars sold at ADESA's  auctions  and the  expansion of AFC's floor plan
financing business.  In 1996 portfolio and reinsurance included a one-time tax
benefit for an IRS audit adjustment.

Earnings  per share of common  stock for the six months ended June 30, 1997 were
$1.12 compared to $1.10 for the six months ended June 30, 1996. Earnings in 1997
reflect a  significant  increase  in  automotive  services  due to a 28  percent
increase in the number of cars sold at ADESA's  auctions  and the  expansion  of
AFC's  floor  plan  financing  business.  1997  earnings  also  reflect  a solid
performance from electric operations and consistent performance by the portfolio
and reinsurance portion of the investments  segment.  In  1996  portfolio  and
reinsurance  included  a  one-time  tax  benefit  for an IRS  audit  adjustment.
Corporate  charges and other reflect increased debt service costs as a result of
the higher balance of commercial  paper in 1997 and six months of  distributions
with respect to the Cumulative  Quarterly Income Preferred  Securities issued in
March 1996.  Earnings in 1996 include a gain in water  services from the sale of
water  assets and the sale of a joint venture interest by real estate.

</TABLE>

Consolidated Financial Comparison
Quarters Ended June 30, 1997 and 1996.

Operating  revenue and income was up $21.9 million (10.5  percent) due primarily
to an  increase in the number of cars sold at ADESA's  auctions.  An increase in
real estate sales also  contributed  to the  increase in  operating  revenue and
income.

Fuel and purchased  power were down $2.3 million (4.8  percent)  because of a 16
percent decrease in generation at the Company's coal fired  generating  stations
due to  unscheduled  outages and a 9 percent  reduction in power  purchased from
other  suppliers.  The price of  purchased  power was  substantially  higher per
megawatthour  because of a limited supply  available for purchase and additional
transmission fees assessed for the delivery of power within the Midwest.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Operations  expenses  were  up  $11.3  million  (8.8  percent),  reflecting  the
expansion of ADESA's  automobile  auction  operations,  AFC, ISI and Palm Coast.

Interest  expense  was  higher  in 1997 due  primarily  to a higher  balance  of
commercial paper.

Income tax expense  was  significantly  higher in 1997 due to the $11.7  million
increase in operating  income and the recognition of a $2 million tax benefit by
Lehigh in 1996.


Consolidated Financial Comparison
Six Months Ended June 30, 1997 and 1996.

Operating revenue and income was up $41.3 million (10 percent), primarily due to
the  addition  of ADESA's  nine new  auction  sites and  increased  car sales at
existing ADESA  auctions.  Also,  revenue from water services was higher in 1997
because of increased rates approved by the FPSC effective in September 1996. The
increase was partially  offset by lower revenue  following the sale of two water
systems by Heater in 1996. A $1.1 million  pre-tax gain on the sale of one water
system in South Carolina was recognized in March 1996.

Operations expenses were up $29.8 million (12.1 percent). The increase reflected
$14.1 million of expenses from the eight automobile auction sites added by ADESA
in 1996  and  one  auction  site  added  in  1997.  The  expansion  of AFC,  and
acquisitions of ISI and Palm Coast, also increased operations expense in 1997.

Interest  expense  was higher in 1997 due  primarily  to more  commercial  paper
issued.

Distributions  on redeemable  preferred  securities of subsidiary were higher in
1997 because the securities were outstanding for the six months in 1997 compared
to less than four months in 1996.

Income tax  expense  was  significantly  higher in 1997 due to the $9.3  million
increase in operating  income and the recognition of a $2 million tax benefit by
Lehigh in 1996.


Business Segment Comparison
Quarters Ended June 30, 1997 and 1996.

Electric  Operations.  Operating  revenue  and income was up  slightly  in 1997.
Proceeds from the sale of rights to microwave  frequencies and the sale of river
land to the State of  Minnesota  offset a decline in revenue  from an 11 percent
decrease in total kilowatthour sales. Kilowatthour sales for resale by MPEX, the
Company's  power  marketing  division,  were down 40 percent in 1997 due to less
power  available for resale.  Less power was available  because of higher prices
for purchased power, various generating unit outages,  reduction in transmission
capability  damaged  by severe  spring  storms  in the  Midwest  and less  hydro
generation in Canada.  While  revenue from MPEX sales was lower in 1997,  higher
profit margins were realized on these sales.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 31 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1997  compared  to 33 percent in 1996.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 12 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1997 and 11 percent in 1996. Sales to other power
suppliers  accounted  for 12  percent  of  electric  operating  revenue  in 1997
compared to 15 percent in 1996.

Total electric  operating expenses decreased by $5.2 million in 1997 including a
$2.3  million   decrease  in  fuel  and  purchased   power  because  of  reduced
kilowatthour  sales.  Recent  reform of the  Minnesota  property tax system also
reduced operating expenses in 1997.

Water  Services.  Operating  revenue and income from water services was lower in
1997  primarily due to lower revenue  following the sale of two water systems by
Heater in 1996 and lower consumption by customers in Florida and North Carolina.
Operating expenses were also lower because of ongoing cost controls and improved
operating efficiency.

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Automotive  Services.  Operating  revenue and income was $19.2 million higher in
1997 due  primarily to the  addition of nine new  automobile  auction  sites and
increased sales at existing  sites.  ADESA sold 204,000 cars in 1997 compared to
160,000 in 1996.  Growth of AFC's floor plan  financing  business and  increased
transport  business also increased revenue and income.  Operating  expenses were
higher in 1997  because of the  addition  of nine  auction  sites and  increased
activity  at  existing  sites.  The  expansion  of AFC's  floor plan  financing
business also contributed to higher operating expenses.

Investments.

   - Securities  Portfolio and Reinsurance.  The Company's securities portfolio
     and reinsurance  continued to perform well in 1997 as in 1996. Capital Re's
     contribution  to earnings  increased in 1997. A one-time tax benefit for an
     IRS audit adjustment was included in 1996.

   - Real Estate  Operations.  Revenue was up in 1997 as a result of additional
     sales of  properties  at Palm  Coast.  Expenses  also  were  higher  due to
     expanded  operations.  The  recognition  of $2 million of tax  benefits  at
     Lehigh in 1996 made real estate's contribution to net income higher in 1996
     than 1997.

Business Segment Comparison
Six Months Ended June 30, 1997 and 1996.

Electric  Operations.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations was
up slightly in 1997.  Proceeds from the sale of rights to microwave  frequencies
and the sale of river land to the State of Minnesota offset a decline in revenue
resulting from a 7 percent decrease in total kilowatthour  sales.  The decrease
is attributed to a decline  in sales to other  power  suppliers  due to less
power  available  for resale.  Less power was available because of higher prices
for purchased power, various generating unit outages, reduction in transmission
capability damaged by severe spring storms in the Midwest and less hydro
generation in Canada. The  decrease in kilowatt sales was  partially  offset by
an  increase in sales to paper customers because of a higher demand for paper.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 32 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1997 and 1996.  Electric sales to paper and other
wood-products  companies  accounted for 12 percent of electric operating revenue
in 1997 and 11 percent in 1996. Sales to other power suppliers  accounted for 10
percent of electric operating revenue in 1997 compared to 12 percent in 1996.

Total electric  operating expenses decreased by $5.2 million in 1997 including a
$1.9  million   decrease  in  fuel  and  purchased   power  because  of  reduced
kilowatthour sales. Lower property taxes due to the 1997 reform of the Minnesota
property tax system and lower interest charges also contributed to the cost
reductions in 1997 operating expenses.

Water Services.  Operating  revenue and income from water services was higher in
1997  primarily  because of  increased  rates  approved  by the FPSC in 1996 for
Florida  Water  customers.  The increase was  partially  offset by lower revenue
following  the sale of two  water  systems  by Heater  in 1996.  A $1.1  million
pre-tax gain on the sale of one water system in South Carolina was recognized in
March 1996.

Automotive Services. Operating revenue and income was $40 million higher in 1997
due primarily to the addition of nine new automobile auction sites and increased
sales at existing sites.  ADESA sold 391,000 cars in 1997 compared to 305,000 in
1996.  Growth  of AFC's  floor  plan  financing  business,  increased  transport
business and a gain on the sale of an auction also increased revenue and income.
Operating  expenses  were higher in 1997 because of the addition of nine auction
sites and  increased  activity at existing  sites.  The expansion of AFC's floor
plan financing business also contributed to higher operating expenses.

Investments.

   - Securities  Portfolio and Reinsurance.  The Company's securities portfolio
     and  reinsurance  earned an  annualized  after tax return of 8.6 percent in
     1997 compared to 9.8 percent in 1996. A one-time tax benefit for an IRS
     audit adjustment was included in 1996.

   - Real Estate  Operations.  Revenue was down in 1997  compared to 1996 which
     included $3.7 million from the sale of Lehigh's joint venture investment in
     a resort  and  golf  course.  The  April  1996  acquisition  of Palm  Coast
     increased  1997  operating  revenue and  expenses.  The  recognition  of $2
     million of tax benefits at Lehigh in 1996 made real  estate's  contribution
     to net income higher in 1996 than 1997.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Reference is made to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months
ended June 30, 1997 and 1996, for purposes of the following discussion.

Cash Flow Activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number of
factors  representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 4 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

AFC has sold a total of $75 million of  receivables  to a third party  purchaser
since  December  1996,  including $25 million in May 1997.  Under the terms of a
five year agreement,  the purchaser agrees to make investments  aggregating $100
million,  at any one time  outstanding,  to the extent that such investments are
supported by eligible  receivables.  Proceeds  from the sale of the  receivables
were used to repay borrowings from the Company.

In June 1997 Minnesota  Power  refinanced $10 million of industrial  development
revenue  bonds and $29 million of  pollution  control  bonds with $39 million of
Variable  Rate Demand  Revenue  Refunding  Bonds  Series 1997A due June 1, 2020,
Series  1997B and Series 1997C due June 1, 2013 and Series 1997D due December 1,
2007.  A total of $36.5  million of the  transaction  was  completed in June and
July. The remaining $2.5 million of the  refinancing is expected to be completed
by October 1997. In May 1997 MP Water  Resources' $30 million 10.44%  long-term
note payable was refinanced  with $24 million of Florida  Water's First Mortgage
Bonds,  8.01%  Series due May 30,  2017 and $6 million of  internally  generated
funds.

Capital Requirements. Consolidated capital expenditures for the six months ended
June 30, 1997 totaled $34 million.  These  expenditures  include $17 million for
electric  operations,  $10  million  for  water  services  and  $7  million  for
automotive  services.  Internally  generated  funds were the primary  source for
funding capital expenditures.


New Accounting Standards

In June 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 (SFAS 130), "Reporting  Comprehensive Net
Income",  effective for fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 1997.  While
earlier application is permitted, the Company does not intend to do so. SFAS 130
establishes  standards for reporting  and display of  comprehensive  income in a
full  set of  general-purpose  financial  statements.  Comprehensive  income  is
defined as the change in equity during a period from all  transactions and other
events from nonowner sources. The adoption of SFAS 130 is not expected to impact
the Company's financial position or results of operations.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
Also in June 1997 the FASB issued SFAS 131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information",  effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1997. SFAS 131 requires the reporting of certain  information about
operating segments of an enterprise.  The Company believes that it is already in
compliance with SFAS 131 in all material respects.

In February 1997 the FASB issued SFAS 128,  "Earnings per Share,"  effective for
financial  statements  for both interim and annual periods ending after December
15,  1997.  Earlier  application  is  not  permitted.  SFAS  128  specifies  the
computation,  presentation  and disclosure  requirements  for earnings per share
(EPS).  The objective of the new standard is to simplify the  computation of EPS
and make the U.S.  standard for this  computation  more  compatible with the EPS
standards  of other  countries  and with  that of the  International  Accounting
Standards  Committee.  The adoption of SFAS 128 is expected to be  immaterial to
the Company's results of operations.

the following updates.  Unless otherwise indicated,  cited references are to the
Company's 1996 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 13. - Fifth Paragraph

On June  30,  1997  the  NCUC  approved  the  transfer  of  LaGrange  Waterworks
Corporation  (LaGrange)  to Heater.  The Company  has agreed to exchange  96,000
shares of Common Stock for the outstanding shares of LaGrange.  The public staff
of  the  NCUC  and  the City of Fayetteville filed requests for reconsideration
of the NCUC's approval of the transfer.  LaGrange provides water services to
approximately 5,300 customers near Fayetteville, NC.

On June 2, 1997 operations  officially began at MP Water Resources' newly formed
subsidiary,  Americas' Water Services Corporation  (Americas' Water).  Americas'
Water,  which  is  headquartered  in  Chicago,   Illinois,   offers  management,
operations and  maintenance  contract  services and expertise to governments and
industries  throughout  the  Americas.  MP Water  Resources  is a  wholly  owned
subsidiary of the Company.

As required by Hernando County, on April 14, 1997 Florida Water filed for a rate
change with the Hernando County Board of Commissioners. Florida Water filed for
an annual interim rate reduction of $258,780  (-3.3 percent) and a final rate
increase of $123,897 (1.6 percent). On June 14,  1997  the  final  rate increase
Florida  Water  requested  became effective  automatically  by operation of law
because  Hernando County failed to take action on the rates within the
prescribed statutory period.

In July 1997 Florida Water reached a settlement  agreement with Hernando  County
regarding  the rate  case  Florida  Water  filed in April  1997.  Under the 
settlement  agreement,  new rates will be effective September  1, 1997 and
are  expected to result in $6.3  million of revenue on an annual basis, a
$1.6 million decrease from current revenue levels implemented on June 14,
1997.  Rates will then be  increased  January 1, 1999 to result in $7.2 
million in revenue on an annual basis. Florida Water has also agreed not to file
for new rates with Hernando  County prior to September  2000. All litigation was
dismissed by both parties.

Florida Water's settlement  agreement with Hernando County supersedes the FPSC's
February  14,  1997  order  which  required  Florida  Water to  charge  rates to
customers in Hernando County based on a modified stand-alone rate structure.


Ref. Page 14. - Following the Second Paragraph

On July 2, 1997  Florida  Water filed for a rate  change  with the  Hillsborough
County  Utilities  Department.  The  Company  filed for an annual  interim  rate
increase of $848,845  (43.1 percent) and a final rate increase of $877,607 (44.6
percent).  Interim rates are  anticipated  to become  effective 45 days from the
date of the filing. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this case.

In July 1997 Florida  Water filed two index  filings which if approved  will
increase revenue by $436,000.  Approval is expected on or about October 1, 1997.
Under Florida  law water and  wastewater  utilities  may make an annual  index
filing designed to recover inflationary costs associated with operation and
maintenance expense.

lanes.

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",   "estimates",  "expects",
"intends",   "plans",  "predicts",   "projects",  "will  likely  result",  "will
continue",  or similar  expressions)  are not statements of historical facts and
may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:
(i) prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those of
the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the SCPSC and the PSCW,  with respect to
allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal
of assets and  facilities,  operation,  and  construction  of plant  facilities,
recovery of purchased  power,  and present or  prospective  wholesale and retail
competition  (including  but not  limited to retail  wheeling  and  transmission
costs);  (ii) economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
risks;  (iii) changes in and compliance with  environmental  and safety laws and
policies;  (iv) weather conditions;  (v) population growth rates and demographic
patterns; (vi) competition for retail and wholesale customers; (vii) pricing and
transportation of commodities; (viii) market demand, including structural market
changes;  (ix)  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of  inflation;  (x)
changes in project costs; (xi)  unanticipated  changes in operating expenses and
capital  expenditures;  (xii) capital market conditions;  (xiii) competition for
new  energy  development  opportunities;  and  (xiv)  legal  and  administrative
proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal)  and  settlements  that  influence the
business and profitability of the Company.

Any  forward-looking  statements  speaks  only  as of the  date  on  which  such
statement  is made,  and the  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any
forward-looking  statement to reflect events or circumstances  after the date on
which such  statement  is made or to reflect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated
events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of such  factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any
such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

prior to such default or (b) two percent (2%) over the rate of interest publicly
announced by Morgan  Guaranty Trust Company in New York, New York, as its "base"
or "prime" rate.

         The Regular Record Date referred to in Section 207 of the Indenture for
the payment of the interest on the  Securities of the Fourth  Series  payable on
any Interest  Payment Date shall be the first  Business Day next  preceding such
Interest Payment Date.

            Section  2.02.  Required  Redemptions  in the  Event of Prior  First
Mortgage  Bond  Redemptions.  If at any time and from time to time,  the Company
shall  notify the  Trustee  and any Holder of First  Mortgage  Bonds  issued and
outstanding under the First  Supplemental  Indenture or the Second  Supplemental
Indenture  (the "Prior First  Mortgage  Bonds") of the  occurrence of any one or
more of the events and conditions described in Sections 3.01(B),  3.01(C), 3.02,
3.03(A),  3.03(B),  3.03(C),  3.03(D), 3.05, 3.06, 3.09, 4.01(B), 4.01(C), 4.02,

the Securities of the Fourth Series,

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

which Company Special  Redemption Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
event or  condition  which is the  basis  for such  Company  Special  Redemption
Notice.  Without  limiting  the  foregoing,  if the Company is required  for any
reason whatsoever to prepay, redeem,  purchase or otherwise retire (collectively
a "Special  Redemption")  the Prior First Mortgage  Bonds,  in whole or in part,
then, and in such event,  the Company shall, not more than 40 days nor less than
30 days prior to the date on which any such Special  Redemption is to occur (any
such date of Special  Redemption  being  herein  referred  to as a "Prior  First
Mortgage Bond Redemption  Date") give written notice (a "Company  Notice"):  (a)
specifying such fact, (b) identifying  such Prior First Mortgage Bond Redemption
Date, (c) stating that a premium may be payable in connection  with such Special
Redemption, and, if so, the estimated amount thereof, together with a reasonably
detailed  computation of such estimated  premium,  (d) identifying the amount of
Securities  required to be so  redeemed,  (e)  offering  to redeem an  aggregate
principal amount of Outstanding  Securities of the Fourth Series equal to (i) in
the case of Special Redemptions pursuant to Sections 3.01(B),  3.01(C), 3.03(A),
3.03(B),  3.03(C),  3.03(D), 3.05, 4.01(B),  4.01(C), 4.03(A), 4.03(B), 4.03(C),
4.03(D) and 4.05 of the Second Supplemental Indenture, a pro rata portion of the
amount of Securities required to be redeemed pursuant to such Sections, such pro
rata  portion to be based upon the ratio of (A) the then  Outstanding  aggregate
principal  amount  of the  Securities  of the  Fourth  Series  to (B)  the  then
Outstanding  aggregate  principal  amount of the Securities of the Fourth Series
and the Prior First Mortgage Bonds, and (ii) in the case of Sections 3.02, 3.06,
3.09, 4.02, 4.06 and 4.09 of the Second  Supplemental  Indenture,  the aggregate
principal  amount of the Securities of the Fourth  Series,  and (f) specifying a
date,  which  shall be not more than 20 days nor less than 10 days prior to such
Prior  First  Mortgage  Bond  Redemption  Date,  on  which  each  Holder  of the
Securities of the Fourth Series must accept or decline such offer of redemption.
Each Holder of the then  outstanding  Securities of the Fourth Series shall have
the right to accept such offer and require  redemption of the  Securities of the
Fourth  Series  held by such  Holder by written  notice to the  Company  and the
Trustee (a "Bondholder  Notice") given not later than the date specified in such
Company Notice.  The Company shall, on said Prior First Mortgage Bond Redemption
Date,  redeem on an equal and ratable basis with the Prior First  Mortgage Bonds
which are to be redeemed on such Prior First Mortgage Bond Redemption  Date, the
Securities of the Fourth Series  Outstanding under the Indenture held by Holders
which have so accepted such offer of redemption;  provided, however, that to the
extent the Holders of the  Securities  of any Series to be redeemed  pursuant to
this  Section  2.02 or pursuant to the  above-referenced  Sections of the Second
Supplemental  Indenture waive any right of redemption or elect not to accept the
Company's offer of redemption,  an additional  principal amount of Securities of
the other  Series,  in an amount equal to the amount so waived or as to which an
offer is not accepted, shall be redeemed,  distributed pro rata among such other
Series based upon the ratio described  above,  but excluding from clause (B) the
principal amount of the Securities of the Series with respect to which there has
been a waiver or an offer unaccepted, except to the extent waived by the Holders
of the Securities of such other Series; provided further, however, to the extent
the  Holders  of the  majority  of the  Securities  of the  Second  Series and a
majority of the Securities of the Third Series,  in each case then  Outstanding,
waive redemption  pursuant to the applicable Sections of the Second Supplemental
Indenture, then the Company shall have no obligation to redeem Securities of the
Fourth  Series  pursuant  to this  Section  2.02.  The  redemption  price of the
Securities of 

                                      -10-

the Fourth Series to be so redeemed on such Prior First Mortgage Bond Redemption
Date shall be an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the
Securities of the Fourth Series so to be redeemed and accrued  interest  thereon
to the date of  prepayment,  together  with a  premium  equal to the  Make-Whole
Amount,  determined as of two Business  Days prior to such Prior First  Mortgage
Bond Redemption Date.

            Section 2.03.  Optional  Prepayments  with  Make-Whole  Amount.  The
Company may, at its option,  upon notice as provided  below,  prepay at any time
all, or from time to time any part of,  Securities of the Fourth  Series,  in an
amount not less than 10% of the aggregate  principal amount of Securities of the
Fourth Series then outstanding in the case of a partial  prepayment,  at 100% of
the principal  amount so prepaid,  together with interest accrued thereon to the
date  of  such  prepayment,  plus  the  Make-Whole  Amount  determined  for  the
prepayment  date with respect to such  principal  amount.  The Company will give
each Holder of Securities of the Fourth Series  written  notice of each optional
prepayment  under this  Section 2.03 not less than thirty (30) days and not more
than  sixty (60) days  prior to the date  fixed for such  prepayment.  Each such
notice shall specify such date, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities
of the Fourth Series to be prepaid on such date,  the  principal  amount of each
Bond held by such Holder to be prepaid  (determined  in accordance  with Section
2.07),  and the interest to be paid on the prepayment  date with respect to such
principal amount being prepaid,  and shall be accompanied by a certificate of an
Authorized Officer as to the estimated  Make-Whole Amount due in connection with
such  prepayment  (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the
prepayment),  setting forth the details of such  computation.  Two Business Days
prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each Holder of Securities
of the Fourth  Series a  certificate  of an Authorized  Officer  specifying  the
calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified prepayment date.

            Section 2.04.  Required Prepayment in the Event of Certain Defaults.
So long as any  Securities of the Fourth Series remain  outstanding,  if (a) the
Company or any  Subsidiary  is in default (as principal or as guarantor or other
surety) in the payment of any  principal of or premium or  make-whole  amount or
interest on any  Indebtedness  that is  outstanding  in an  aggregate  principal
amount of at least  $5,000,000  beyond any period of grace provided with respect
thereto,  or (b) the Company or any Subsidiary is in default in the  performance
of or  compliance  with  any  term of any  evidence  of any  Indebtedness  in an
aggregate  outstanding  principal  amount  of at  least  $5,000,000  or  of  any
mortgage,  indenture or other agreement  relating thereto or any other condition
exists,  and as a consequence of such default or condition such Indebtedness has
become,  or has been  declared  (or one or more  Persons are entitled to declare
such  Indebtedness  to be), due and payable before its stated maturity or before
its  regularly  scheduled  dates  of  payment,  or (c) as a  consequence  of the
occurrence or continuation of any event or condition  (other than the passage of
time or the right of the Holder of  Indebtedness  to convert  such  Indebtedness
into equity  interests),  (i) the Company or any Subsidiary has become obligated
to purchase  or repay  Indebtedness  before its  regular  maturity or before its
regularly  scheduled  dates of payment  in an  aggregate  outstanding  principal
amount of at least  $5,000,000,  or (ii) one or more  Persons  have the right to
require the Company or any Subsidiary so to purchase or repay such Indebtedness,
then the Company shall promptly and in any event within two (2) Business Days of
the date of  

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
occurrence  of any  such  event  notify  the  Trustee  and  the  Holders  of the
Securities of the Fourth Series and the Company shall redeem,  within sixty (60)
days thereafter and upon at least ten (10) days notice, all of the Securities of
the Fourth Series then  Outstanding,  together with interest  accrued thereon to
the  date  of  redemption,  plus  the  Make-Whole  Amount  determined  for  such
redemption date two Business Days prior thereto. Two Business Days prior to such
redemption,  the Company shall  deliver to each Holder of the  Securities of the
Fourth Series a certificate of an Authorized  Officer specifying the calculation
of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified redemption date.

            Section 2.05. Required Prepayment in the Event of Certain Judgments.
So long as any  Securities of the Fourth Series remain  outstanding,  if a final
judgment  or  judgments  for the  payment  of money  aggregating  in  excess  of
$10,000,000 are rendered against one or more of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and which judgments are not, within sixty (60) days after entry thereof (or such
longer period as shall be permitted by the express terms of any such judgment or
judgments),  bonded,  discharged or stayed pending appeal, or are not discharged
within  sixty  (60) days (or such  longer  period as shall be  permitted  by the
express terms of any such judgment or  judgments)  after the  expiration of such
stay,  then the Company shall  promptly and in any event within two (2) Business
Days of the date of  occurrence  of any such event  notify the  Trustee  and the
Holders of the  Securities  of the Fourth  Series and the Company  shall redeem,
within sixty (60) days thereafter and upon at least ten (10) days notice, all of
the  Securities  of the Fourth Series then  Outstanding,  together with interest
accrued thereon to the date of redemption, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined
for such  redemption  date two Business  Days prior  thereto.  Two Business Days
prior to such  redemption,  the  Company  shall  deliver  to each  Holder of the
Securities  of  the  Fourth  Series  a  certificate  of  an  Authorized  Officer
specifying  the  calculation  of  such  Make-Whole  Amount  as of the  specified
redemption date.

            Section  2.06.  Required  Prepayment  in the Event of Certain  ERISA
Defaults. So long as any Securities of the Fourth Series remain outstanding,  if
(a) any Plan shall fail to satisfy the minimum funding standards of ERISA or the
Code  for any  plan  year or part  thereof  or a  waiver  of such  standards  or
extension of any  amortization  period is sought or granted under section 412 of
the Code,  (b) a notice of intent to  terminate  any Plan  shall have been or is
reasonably  expected to be filed with the PBGC or the PBGC shall have instituted

aggregate  "amount of  unfunded  benefit  liabilities"  (within  the  meaning of
Section  4001(a)(18)  of ERISA) under all Plans,  determined in accordance  with
Title IV of  ERISA,  shall  exceed  $1,000,000,  (d) the  Company  or any  ERISA

                                      -12-

have a Material Adverse Effect, then the Company shall promptly and in any event
within two (2) Business  Days of the date of occurrence of any such event notify
the  Trustee  and the  Holders of the  Securities  of the Fourth  Series and the
Company shall redeem,  within sixty (60) days  thereafter  and upon at least ten
(10) days notice,  all of the Securities of the Fourth Series then  Outstanding,
together  with  interest  accrued  thereon to the date of  redemption,  plus the
Make-Whole  Amount  determined for such  redemption date two Business Days prior
thereto.  Two Business Days prior to such redemption,  the Company shall deliver
to each  Holder of the  Securities  of the  Fourth  Series a  certificate  of an
Authorized  Officer  specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole  Amount as of
the specified redemption date.

As used in this Section 2.06,  the terms  "employee  benefit plan" and "employee
welfare benefit plan" shall have the respective  meanings assigned to such terms
in Section 3 of ERISA.

            Section 2.07. Allocation of Partial Prepayments. In the case of each
partial  prepayment of the Securities of the Fourth Series, the principal amount
of the  Securities of the Fourth  Series to be prepaid shall be allocated  among
all  of  the  Securities  of the  Fourth  Series  at  the  time  outstanding  in
proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts
thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.

            Section  2.08.  Maturity;  Surrender,  Etc.  In  the  case  of  each
prepayment of Securities of the Fourth Series  pursuant to this Article  Second,
the  principal  amount  of each of the  Securities  of the  Fourth  Series to be
prepaid  shall  be and  become  due and  payable  on the  date  fixed  for  such
prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date
and the applicable  Make-Whole  Amount, if any. From and after such date, unless
the Company  shall fail to pay such  principal  amount when so due and  payable,
together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest
on such  principal  amount  shall  cease to accrue.  Any  Security of the Fourth
Series paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled
and shall not be reissued,  and no Security of the Fourth Series shall be issued
in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Security of the Fourth Series.

            Section  2.09.  Purchase of  Securities  of the Fourth  Series.  The
Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase,  redeem,  prepay
or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly,  any of the outstanding Securities
of the Fourth Series except upon the payment or prepayment of the  Securities of
the  Fourth  Series  in  accordance  with the terms of this  Third  Supplemental
Indenture  and the  Securities of the Fourth  Series.  The Company will promptly
cancel all  Securities  of the Fourth  Series  acquired  by it or any  Affiliate
pursuant to any  payment,  prepayment  or purchase of  Securities  of the Fourth
Series  pursuant to any  provision of this Third  Supplemental  Indenture and no
Securities  of the Fourth Series may be issued in  substitution  or exchange for
any such Securities of the Fourth Series.

            Section 2.10. Make-Whole Amount. The term "Make-Whole Amount" means,
with  respect to any  Security  of the  Fourth  Series,  an amount  equal to the
excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with
respect to the Called  Principal of such  Security of the Fourth Series over the
amount of such Called  Principal;  provided

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

that the  Make-Whole  Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes
of determining  the Make-Whole  Amount,  the following  terms have the following
meanings:

                  "Called  Principal" means, with respect to any Security of the
         Fourth Series, the principal of such Security of the Fourth Series that
         is to be prepaid  pursuant to Section 2.02 (if the related  prepayment,
         redemption or retirement of Prior First  Mortgage  Bonds is made with a
         premium), Section 2.03, Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section 2.06 or has
         become or is declared  to be  immediately  due and payable  pursuant to
         Section 1102 of the Original Indenture, as the context requires.

                  "Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called Principal
         of  any  Security  of  the  Fourth  Series,   the  amount  obtained  by
         discounting  all  Remaining  Scheduled  Payments  with  respect to such
         Called  Principal  from  their  respective  scheduled  due dates to the
         Settlement  Date with respect to such Called  Principal,  in accordance
         with accepted  financial  practice and at a discount factor (applied on
         the same periodic  basis as that on which interest on the Securities of
         the Fourth  Series is  payable)  equal to the  Reinvestment  Yield with
         respect to such Called Principal.

                  "Reinvestment   Yield"  means,  with  respect  to  the  Called
         Principal of any Security of the Fourth Series, 0.50% over the yield to
         maturity implied by (a) the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M. (New York
         City time) on the second  Business Day  preceding the  Settlement  Date
         with respect to such Called  Principal,  on the display  designated  as
         "Page USD" of the Bloomberg  Financial  Markets Services Screen (or, if
         not available,  any other national  recognized trading screen reporting
         on-line intraday trading in the U.S. Treasury  securities) for actively
         traded  U.S.  Treasury  securities  having  a  maturity  equal  to  the
         Remaining  Average Life of such Called  Principal as of such Settlement
         Date,  or (b) if such  yields are not  reported  as of such time or the
         yields  reported as of such time are not  ascertainable,  the  Treasury
         Constant Maturity Series Yields reported,  for the latest day for which
         such  yields  have  been so  reported  as of the  second  Business  Day
         preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in
         Federal  Reserve  Statistical  Release  H.15  (519) (or any  comparable
         successor  publication)  for actively traded U.S.  Treasury  securities
         having a constant  maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such
         Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be
         determined,   if  necessary,  by  (i)  converting  U.S.  Treasury  bill
         quotations  to  bond-equivalent  yields  in  accordance  with  accepted
         financial  practice  and (ii)  interpolating  linearly  between (1) the
         actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the duration closest to and
         greater than the  Remaining  Average  Life and (2) the actively  traded
         U.S.  Treasury  security with the duration closest to and less than the
         Remaining Average Life.

                  "Remaining  Average  Life"  means,  with respect to any Called
         Principal,  the number of years (calculated to the nearest  one-twelfth
         year)  obtained by dividing (a) such Called  Principal into (b) the sum
         of the products obtained by multiplying (i) the principal  component of
         each Remaining  Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal
         by (ii) the  number of years  (calculated  to the  nearest  one-

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

         twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect
         to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining 
         Scheduled Payment.

                  "Remaining  Scheduled  Payments"  means,  with  respect to the
         Called Principal of any Security of the Fourth Series,  all payments of
         such Called  Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the
         Settlement Date with respect to such Called  Principal if no payment of
         such  Called  Principal  were  made  prior to its  scheduled  due date;
         provided that if such  Settlement  Date is not a date on which interest
         payments  are due to be made under the terms of the  Securities  of the
         Fourth  Series,  then  the  amount  of the  next  succeeding  scheduled
         interest  payment will be reduced by the amount of interest  accrued to
         such  Settlement  Date and required to be paid on such  Settlement Date
         pursuant to Section  2.02 (if the  related  prepayment,  redemption  or
         retirement  of Prior  First  Mortgage  Bonds is made  with a  premium),
         Section 2.03, Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section 2.06 or has become or
         is declared to be immediately due and payable  pursuant to Section 1102
         of the Original Indenture.

                  "Settlement  Date" means, with respect to the Called Principal
         of any  Security  of the Fourth  Series,  the date on which such Called
         Principal  is to be prepaid  pursuant  to Section  2.02 (if the related
         prepayment,  redemption or retirement of Prior First  Mortgage Bonds is
         made with a premium),  or Section  2.03,  Section  2.04,  Section 2.05,
         Section  2.06 or has become or is  declared to be  immediately  due and
         payable  pursuant to Section  1102 of the  Original  Indenture,  as the
         context requires.


                                  ARTICLE THIRD

                     ADDITIONAL COVENANTS FOR FOURTH SERIES

            Section 3.01.  Debt  Covenant  Required  Redemption.  So long as any
Securities of the Fourth Series shall remain Outstanding, the Company shall file
with the Trustee,  on or before March 31 of each calendar year, an  Accountant's
Certificate showing as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year
(1) the aggregate  principal  amount of Securities then  Outstanding and (2) the
net book value of property,  plant and equipment,  determined in accordance with
GAAP, which constitute Property Additions. If such aggregate principal amount of
Securities then Outstanding exceeds sixty per centum (60%) of the net book value
of such property, plant and equipment then the Company shall promptly notify the
Trustee  and, if there is only one Holder of  Securities  of the Fourth  Series,
such Holder;  and the Company shall redeem,  within ninety days  thereafter  and
upon at least thirty days' notice,  a principal amount of the Securities of such
Series then  Outstanding  equal to a pro rata portion of the amount necessary to
cause the aggregate  principal  amount of Securities  then  Outstanding to equal
sixty  per  centum  (60%) of the net  book  value of such  property,  plant  and
equipment,  such pro rata portion of such Series to be based upon a ratio of (A)
the then Outstanding  aggregate principal amount of Securities of such Series to
(B) the then Outstanding  aggregate  principal  amounts of the Securities of the
Second Series, of the Third Series and of the Fourth Series; provided,  however,
that to the extent any of the Holders of Securities of the Second Series, of the
Third  Series  or of the

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
Fourth Series waive any right of redemption,  an additional  principal amount of
Securities of the other Series,  in an amount equal to the amount waived,  shall
be redeemed,  distributed  pro rata among such other Series based upon the ratio
described  above,  but  excluding  from clause (B) the  principal  amount of the
Securities  of the Series with respect to which there has been a waiver,  except
to the extent waived by the Holders of the Securities of such other Series.  The
Redemption Price of the Securities of the Fourth Series shall be the outstanding
principal  amount of the  Securities  of such Series to be redeemed  pursuant to
this  Section  3.01 plus the Make  Whole  Amount  plus  interest  accrued to the
Redemption  Date.  The  Holders of a majority  of the  Securities  of the Fourth
Series then  Outstanding may waive  redemption  pursuant to this Section 3.01 by
delivering a written  waiver to the Trustee,  in such form as the Trustee  shall
deem acceptable,  with a copy to the Company,  within ten days after the date of
such notice of redemption.

            Section 3.02.  Restricted Payments. So long as any Securities of the
Fourth  Series  remain  Outstanding,  the  Company  shall not declare or pay any
Restricted  Payments unless the Company files an Accountant's  Certificate  with
the Trustee and, if there is only one Holder of Securities of the Fourth Series,
sends a copy to such Holder,  within  thirty days prior to such  declaration  or
payment stating that (A) the amount of such payment shall not exceed  cumulative
net additions to or deductions from Surplus, determined in accordance with GAAP,

due and payable that have or might become a Lien on  properties or assets of the
Company or any Subsidiary;  provided that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
need pay any such tax or assessment  or claims if (a) the amount,  applicability
or validity  thereof is contested by the Company or such  Subsidiary on a timely
basis  in good  faith  and in  appropriate

proceedings,  and the Company or a Subsidiary has established  adequate reserves
therefor in accordance  with GAAP on the books of the Company or such Subsidiary

and in authorized  denominations will be issued to the transferee or transferees
in exchange therefor; and this Security, with or without others of like form and
series,  may in like manner be exchanged  for one or more new  Securities of the
same  series  and  tenor  in  other

authorized  denominations  but in the  same aggregate principal amount; all 
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture.

         No  recourse  shall  be had  for the  payment  of the  principal  of or
premium, if any, or interest,  if any, on this Security,  or any part hereof, or
for  any  claim  based  hereon  or  otherwise  in  respect  hereof,  or  of  the
indebtedness  represented hereby, or upon any obligation,  covenant or agreement
under the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer,
as such,  past,  present or future,  of the  Company  or of any  predecessor  or
successor  corporation (either directly or through the Company, or a predecessor
or successor  corporation),  whether by virtue of any constitutional  provision,
statute or rule of law, or by the  enforcement of any assessment or penalty,  or
otherwise,  all such liability  being waived and released by every Holder hereof
by the  acceptance  of this  Security and as part of the  consideration  for the
issue  hereof,  and  being  likewise  waived  and  released  by the terms of the
Indenture.

         This Security  shall not become valid or obligatory  for any purpose or
be entitled to any benefit  under the Indenture  until  SunTrust  Bank,  Central
Florida, National Association,  or its successor as Trustee under the Indenture,
shall have signed the form of certificate endorsed hereon.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, FLORIDA WATER SERVICES CORPORATION,  formerly known
