                           SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER
              THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  we are  hereby  filing  cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause our actual  results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as that term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this  quarterly  report on Form 10-Q, in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"  "predicts,"  "projects,"  "will  likely  result,"  "will  continue" or
similar  expressions)  are  not  statements  of  historical  facts  and  may  be
forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond our  control and may cause  actual  results to differ
materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

  -   war and acts of terrorism;
  -   prevailing  governmental policies and  regulatory actions, including those
      of the United States Congress, state legislatures, the FERC, the MPUC, the
      FPSC,  the NCUC,  the PSCW and various  county  regulators,  about allowed
      rates of return, industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal of
      assets and facilities,  operation and  construction  of plant  facilities,
      recovery  of  purchased  power and  capital  investments,  and  present or
      prospective wholesale and retail competition (including but not limited to
      transmission costs);
  -   economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;
  -   changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;
  -   weather conditions;
  -   population growth rates and demographic patterns;
  -   competition for retail and wholesale customers;
  -   pricing and transportation of commodities;
  -   market demand, including structural market changes;
  -   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
  -   changes in project costs;
  -   unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
  -   capital market conditions;
  -   competition for new energy and other development opportunities; and
  -   legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and
      settlements that affect the business and profitability of ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking  statement
to reflect  events or  circumstances  after the date on which that  statement is
made or to reflect the occurrence of  unanticipated  events.  New factors emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for  management to predict all of those
factors, nor can it assess the impact of each of those factors on the businesses
of ALLETE or the extent to which any factor,  or  combination  of  factors,  may
cause  actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  contained  in  any
forward-looking statement.

NOTE 2.    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

ADESA AUCTION FACILITIES. On January 18, 2001 we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of ComSearch in exchange for ALLETE common stock and paid cash to purchase
all of the assets of Auto  Placement  Center (now ADESA Impact) in  transactions
with an aggregate  value of $62.4 million.  ADESA Impact was accounted for using
the purchase method.  ADESA Impact  financial  results have been included in our
consolidated  financial  statements  since  the  date  of  purchase.  Pro  forma
financial  results have not been presented due to  immateriality.  ComSearch was
accounted for as a pooling of interests with financial  results  included in our
consolidated financial statements since January 18, 2001. Consolidated financial
results for prior  periods have not been  restated due to  immateriality.  ADESA
Impact is a provider of "total loss" vehicle  recovery  services with 12 auction
facilities  in  the  United  States.  ComSearch  provides  Internet-based  parts
location and insurance adjustment audit services nationwide.

On May 1, 2001 ADESA  purchased  the  assets of the I-44 Auto  Auction in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Financial
results have been included in our  consolidated  financial  statements since the
date of purchase.  Pro forma  financial  results have not been  presented due to
immateriality.  The I-44 Auto Auction, which is located on 75 acres, was renamed
ADESA Tulsa and offers six auction lanes,  storage for over 3,000 vehicles and a
five-bay reconditioning and detail facility.

DICKS CREEK. In February 2001 ALLETE Water Services  finalized the December 2000
purchase  of the  assets of Dicks  Creek,  a  wastewater  utility  located  near
Atlanta, Georgia, for $6.6 million plus a commitment to pay the seller a fee for
residential  connections.  The  commitment  requires the payment of a minimum of
$400,000 annually beginning December 31, 2001 for four years or until cumulative
payments reach $2 million, whichever occurs first. The transaction was accounted
for using the  purchase  method.  Financial  results  have been  included in our
consolidated  financial  statements  since February  2001.  Pro forma  financial
results have not been presented due to immateriality.

ENVENTIS. On July 31, 2001 we acquired Enventis, a data network systems provider
headquartered  in  the  Minneapolis-St.  Paul  area.  In  connection  with  this
acquisition,  we  issued  310,878  shares  of our  common  stock.  Enventis  was
accounted for as a pooling of interests with financial  results  included in our
consolidated  financial statements since July 31, 2001.  Consolidated  financial
results for prior periods have not been restated due to immateriality.

DISPOSAL OF WATER PLANT ASSETS. Effective August 24, 2001 the City of New Smyrna
Beach (City) assumed control of the water and wastewater facilities in the Sugar
Mill Country Club service area following a successful  condemnation action filed
with the  Circuit  Court  for  Volusia  County,  Florida  (Circuit  Court).  The
facilities  serve  approximately  600 customers.  In October 2001 a $2.9 million
deposit was disbursed to Florida Water in accordance with a Circuit Court order.
Settlement  negotiations  to determine  the final  purchase  price are currently
underway between Florida Water and the City.


NOTE 3.    INVESTMENT IN ACE

In May 2000 we recorded a $30.4 million,  or $0.44 per share,  after-tax gain on
the sale of the 4.7 million shares of ACE that we received in December 1999 when
Capital  Re merged  with  ACE.  At the time of the  merger we owned 7.3  million
shares, or 20 percent, of Capital Re.


NOTE 4.    LONG-TERM DEBT

On February  21, 2001 ALLETE  issued $125  million of 7.80%  Senior  Notes,  due
February 15, 2008.  Proceeds were used to repay a portion of ALLETE's short-term
borrowings incurred for the acquisition of vehicle auction facilities  purchased
in 2000 and early 2001, and for general corporate purposes.

<PAGE>


NOTE 8.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the quarter ended  September 30, 2001 total  comprehensive  income was $22.2
million ($31.8 million for the quarter ended  September 30, 2000).  For the nine
months ended  September 30, 2001 total  comprehensive  income was $101.4 million
($123.5  million  for  the  nine  months  ended   September  30,  2000).   Total
comprehensive  income  includes  net  income,  unrealized  gains  and  losses on
securities  classified  as  available-for-sale,  changes in the fair value of an
interest rate swap and foreign currency translation adjustments.


NOTE 9.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD

In July 2001 the FASB issued SFAS 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets."
SFAS 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an  amortization  method to an
impairment-only  approach.  Amortization of goodwill will cease January 1, 2002,
the date we expect to adopt this  standard.  We have $536 million of goodwill as
of  September  30,  2001  and  after-tax   goodwill   amortization   expense  of
approximately  $8 million for the nine months ended  September 30, 2001.  Annual
after-tax  goodwill  amortization  expense is expected to be  approximately  $11
million in 2001. We do not believe we have any goodwill impairment at this time.


NOTE 10.   SQUARE BUTTE POWER PURCHASE CONTRACT

Minnesota Power, our electric utility business,  has a power purchase  agreement
with Square Butte that extends through 2026 (Agreement). It provides a long-term
supply of low-cost  energy to customers in our electric  service  territory  and
enables Minnesota Power to meet power pool reserve requirements. Square Butte, a
North Dakota cooperative corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating
unit (Unit) near Center, North Dakota. The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit
owned by Minnkota Power Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative
corporation  whose Class A members are also  members of Square  Butte.  Minnkota
serves as the operator of the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's  output
under the  Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance
notice  requirement,  Minnkota  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  Minnesota Power
is  obligated  to pay its pro  rata  share  of  Square  Butte's  costs  based on
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to  Unit  output.   Minnesota  Power's  payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service.  At September 30, 2001 Square Butte had total
debt  outstanding of $314.6 million.  Total annual debt service for Square Butte
is expected to be  approximately  $36 million in each of the years 2001  through
2003 and $23 million in both 2004 and 2005. Variable operating costs include the
price of coal purchased from BNI Coal,  Ltd., our subsidiary,  under a long-term
contract.  Minnesota  Power's payments to Square Butte are approved as purchased
power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.


NOTE 11.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In  October  2001  we  executed  an  asset  purchase   agreement  with  LTV  and
Cleveland-Cliffs  to  acquire  certain  non-mining  properties  from LTV for $75
million.  The  non-mining  properties  include LTV's 225 MW electric  generating
facility and existing coal pile at Taconite  Harbor,  a sixty-mile  transmission
line,  railroad trackage rights,  and  approximately  30,000 acres of forest and
recreation  land in northeast  Minnesota.  The  transaction is expected to close
during the fourth quarter.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


ALLETE has  operations in four business  segments:  (1) ENERGY  SERVICES,  which
include  electric  and gas  services,  coal mining and  telecommunications;  (2)
AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES,  which include a network of vehicle auctions, an automobile
dealer finance company,  and several subsidiaries that are integral parts of the
vehicle  redistribution  business;  (3) WATER SERVICES,  which include water and
wastewater services; and (4) INVESTMENTS,  which include real estate operations,
investments in emerging  technologies  related to the electric  utility industry
and a  securities  portfolio.  Corporate  charges  represent  general  corporate
expenses,  including  interest,  not  specifically  related to any one  business
segment.


CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW

Each of our  operating  segments  continued to produce solid  financial  results
during the first nine months of 2001,  reflecting the success of ALLETE's growth
initiatives.  The terrorist  attacks of September  11, 2001 and their  aftermath
have  negatively  impacted  quarterly  results for  Automotive  Services and our
securities  portfolio.  However,  performance  from Energy Services and our real
estate operations  remained strong. For the quarter ended September 30, 2001 net
income increased 8 percent over the same period in 2000.  Earnings per share for
the quarter ended  September 30, 2001  decreased 6 percent  compared to the same
period in 2000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001,  excluding the ACE
transaction (see net income discussion  below), net income was up 14 percent and
earnings  per share  were up 7 percent  over the same  period in 2000.  The 2001
earnings per share  calculation  was impacted by the second quarter common stock
issuance.

<PAGE>

NET INCOME

The following net income discussion  summarizes  significant events for the nine
months ended September 30, 2001.

ENERGY  SERVICES'  net  income  was higher in 2001  reflecting  more  profitable
wholesale  marketing and trading  activities due to warmer  weather,  additional
power  available  to sell  from a recent  240 MW power  purchase  agreement  and
overall market  conditions.  Net income also reflected  partial recovery of 1998
CIP lost margins,  decreased sales to industrial  customers and additional costs
incurred as a result of a severe ice storm and planned maintenance outages.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES reported a 38 percent increase in net income in 2001 due to
significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001 and  increased  financing
activity at AFC's loan  production  offices.  EBITDAL for ADESA's 28  same-store
auction facilities was up 9 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2001
(13 percent for the quarter  ended  September  30,  2001).  Increased  costs and
reduced  sales  volumes  because of  inclement  weather  in early 2001  hampered
financial  results,  as did the events of September 11. For the third quarter of
2001 we  estimated  that the impact of the events of  September 11 resulted in a
$3.5 million decrease to net income. A drop in conversion  rates, the percentage
of vehicles sold from those that were run through  auction lanes,  was primarily
due to a decline in dealer attendance caused by the disruption in air travel and
wholesale prices that were further  depressed  following the events of September
11. Sellers have been reluctant to accept lower wholesale prices. The conversion
rate was 58 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 (60 percent for the
same period in 2000) and 61 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2001
(62 percent for the same period in 2000).  Costs of assimilating  the 28 vehicle
auction facilities acquired or opened in 2000 also impacted 2001 results.

WATER  SERVICES'  net income was  slightly  higher in 2001  reflecting  customer
growth, gains related to the disposal of certain assets and an October 2000 rate
increase  implemented  by Heater.  Above-average  rainfall  in Florida and North
Carolina  during the  second and third  quarters,  and  conservation  efforts in
Florida negatively impacted net income in 2001.

INVESTMENTS  reported lower net income in 2001 primarily due to losses  incurred
by our securities  portfolio as a result of the economic fallout from the events
of September 11. These losses were  subsequently  recovered in October 2001. For
the nine months ended September 30, our securities portfolio earned an after-tax
annualized  return of 4.52  percent  in 2001  (7.00  percent in 2000) on a lower
average  balance  in 2001.  During  2000 we reduced  the size of our  securities
portfolio  to  partially  fund  significant   acquisitions  made  by  Automotive
Services.  Income from our emerging technology funds was also lower in 2001 as a
result of fewer sales of these investments.  Our real estate operations reported
stronger sales in 2001, including its largest sale ever.

CORPORATE CHARGES reflected  increased interest expense and additional  expenses
for incentive compensation accruals and severance packages. In 2000 we reflected
the reversal of previously  recorded tax accruals related to various federal and
state tax issues.

ACE  TRANSACTION.  In May 2000 we recorded a $30.4 million,  or $0.44 per share,
after-tax  gain on the sale of the 4.7 million shares of ACE that we received in
December 1999 when Capital Re merged with ACE.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES' operating revenue was up $21.9 million, or 15 percent, in 2001.
Wholesale  power  marketing  and  trading  activities  were higher due to warmer
weather and additional power available to sell. Retail  megawatthour  sales were
down 8 percent because of temporary shutdowns and reduced production by taconite
customers.  Operating  revenue  from  retail  sales,  however,  was  up  due  to
additional  demand revenue from large power customers who converted a portion of
their  interruptible  power to firm power and fuel clause  recoveries for higher
purchased power and gas prices.  Operating revenue also included $2.8 million of
1998 CIP lost  margins and  Enventis  operations.  Enventis was acquired in July
2001 and accounted for as a pooling of interests.

Revenue from  electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 9 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2001 (13 percent in 2000).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 2001 (5 percent in 2000).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 8
percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2001 (7 percent in 2000).

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES'  operating revenue was up $75.1 million, or 55 percent, in
2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001. At
ADESA auction  facilities  463,000 vehicles were sold in 2001 (337,000 in 2000),
an increase of 37 percent.  Financial  results for 2001 included three months of
operations  from  9  auction  facilities  acquired  in  2000  and  results  from
acquisitions made in early 2001. Sales volumes in 2001 were negatively  impacted
by the  events  of  September  11 as dealer  attendance  and  already  depressed
wholesale  prices  both  dropped  suddenly  during  the last half of  September.
Operating  revenue from AFC was higher in 2001 reflecting a 13 percent  increase
in vehicles  financed  through  existing loan production  offices.  AFC financed
approximately  223,000  vehicles  in 2001  (198,000  in  2000).  AFC had 82 loan
production offices at September 30, 2001 (86 at September 30, 2000).

WATER SERVICES' operating revenue was up $0.8 million, or 3 percent, in 2001 due
to gains from the disposal of certain  assets, a 4 percent increase in customers
and an October 2000 rate increase implemented by Heater. A 6 percent decrease in
consumption was primarily  attributable to above-average rainfall in Florida and
North Carolina,  and conservation efforts in Florida.  Operating revenue in 2000
included  regulatory  relief granted by Florida's  Hillsborough  Board of County
Commissioners.

INVESTMENTS'  operating  revenue was down $1.1 million,  or 11 percent,  in 2001
primarily  because  turbulence  in the  financial  markets  after the  events of
September 11 had a negative  impact on our securities  portfolio.  This decrease
was partially  offset by two large sales from our real estate  operations  which
contributed $4.5 million to operating revenue.

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating  expenses were up $12.3 million,  or 10 percent,  in
2001 primarily due to the inclusion of Enventis  operations.  Operating expenses
also increased in 2001 due to higher plant maintenance expenses.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES' operating expenses were up $70.2 million, or 62 percent, in
2001  primarily  due to  significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001.
Expenses in 2001 included  increased  direct costs  associated  with  processing
vehicles multiple times that did not sell as a result of the events of September
11 which caused low auction  attendance and further depressed  wholesale prices.
Integration costs,  additional  amortization of goodwill and additional interest
expense  related  to debt  issued  in late  2000 to  finance  acquisitions  also
increased 2001 expenses.

WATER SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $0.9 million,  or 4 percent, in 2001
due to  customer  growth  and the  inclusion  of water  and  wastewater  systems
acquired in December 2000.

INVESTMENTS'  operating expenses were up $1.3 million, or 32 percent, in 2001 as
a result of higher sales by our real estate operations.

COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES' operating revenue was up $48.7 million, or 11 percent, in 2001.
Wholesale  power  marketing  and  trading  activities  were higher due to warmer
weather and additional power available to sell. Retail  megawatthour  sales were
down 6 percent because of temporary shutdowns and reduced production by taconite
customers.  Operating  revenue  from  retail  sales,  however,  was  up  due  to
additional  demand revenue from large power customers who converted a portion of
their  interruptible  power to firm power and fuel clause  recoveries for higher
purchased power and gas prices.  Operating revenue also included $2.8 million of
1998 CIP lost margins and Enventis operations.

Revenue from  electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 9 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2001 (13 percent in 2000).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 2001 (5 percent in 2000).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 6
percent of consolidated operating revenue in both 2001 and 2000.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES' operating revenue was up $257.8 million, or 67 percent, in
2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001. At
ADESA auction facilities 1,456,000 vehicles were sold in 2001 (940,000 in 2000),
an increase of 55 percent.  Financial  results for 2001  included nine months of
operations from 28 auction facilities acquired or opened primarily in the second
half of 2000 and results from  acquisitions  made in January and May 2001. Sales
volumes in 2001 were negatively impacted by the events of September 11 as dealer
attendance and already  depressed  wholesale prices both dropped suddenly during
the last half of September. Also, inclement weather earlier in the year resulted
in both low attendance at and canceled auctions.  Operating revenue from AFC was
higher in 2001  reflecting a 14 percent  increase in vehicles  financed  through
existing loan production offices. AFC financed approximately 676,000 vehicles in
2001 (595,000 in 2000). AFC had 82 loan production offices at September 30, 2001
(86 at September 30, 2000).

WATER SERVICES' operating revenue was up $2.0 million, or 2 percent, in 2001 due
to gains from the disposal of certain  assets, a 4 percent increase in customers
and an October 2000 rate increase implemented by Heater.  Above-average rainfall
in Florida and North Carolina,  and conservation  efforts in Florida  negatively
impacted revenue in 2001.  Operating revenue in 2000 included  regulatory relief
granted by Florida's Hillsborough Board of County Commissioners.

INVESTMENTS'  operating  revenue was down $5.4  million,  or 8 percent,  in 2001
primarily  because  turbulence  in the  financial  markets  after the  events of
September 11 had a negative impact on our securities portfolio. In addition, our
securities  portfolio  had a lower  average  balance in 2001.  The  decrease  in
revenue was also  attributed  to $4.9 million less from our emerging  technology
investments  as a result of fewer sales of these  investments  in 2001. Our real
estate  operations  reported  stronger sales at all locations in 2001. Six large
real estate sales in 2001 contributed  $37.5 million to revenue and included our
largest single real estate  transaction to date. In 2000 seven large real estate
sales contributed $31.9 million to revenue.

OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY SERVICES'  operating  expenses were up $36.3 million,  or 10 percent,  in
2001 because of higher  prices paid for purchased  power and purchased  gas, and
the inclusion of Enventis operations.  Operating expenses also increased in 2001
due to higher plant  maintenance  expenses and  additional  costs  incurred as a
result of a severe ice storm.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $235.1 million, or 74 percent,
in 2001 primarily due to significant  acquisitions  made in 2000 and early 2001.
Expenses in 2001 included  increased  direct costs  associated  with  processing
vehicles multiple times that did not sell as a result of the events of September
11 which caused low auction  attendance and further depressed  wholesale prices.
Operating  expenses  in  2001  also  included   integration  costs,   additional
amortization of goodwill,  additional interest expense related to debt issued in
late 2000 to finance  acquisitions,  higher utility expense and more labor costs
incurred as a result of inclement weather in early 2001.

<PAGE>

WATER SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $1.6 million,  or 2 percent, in 2001
due to  customer  growth  and the  inclusion  of water  and  wastewater  systems
acquired in 2000.

INVESTMENTS'  operating expenses were down $5.2 million,  or 18 percent, in 2001
due to reduced expenses associated with sales by our real estate operations.


OUTLOOK

CORPORATE.  In late August 2001 we began a process of systematically  evaluating
our  businesses to determine the strategic  value of our assets and explore ways
to unlock that value. The potential sale of our Water Services businesses is one
result of this process.  (See Water Services below.) We are focusing on our core
competencies,  which include  Automotive and Energy Services  businesses,  in an
effort  to  provide  more  clarity  for  investors.  We  will  disclose  further
development of this plan in early 2002.

The  events  that  affected  the United  States  since  September  11 have had a
negative  impact  on our  financial  results  for  Automotive  Services  and our
securities  portfolio.  In  light  of  continued  economic  uncertainty,  we are
revising our EPS growth projection for 2001 from 12 percent to between 6 percent
and 8 percent over 2000.

Our plan for 2002 will be a part of the  strategy  development.  At this time we
expect EPS growth from operations to exceed 2001 EPS growth.

ENERGY SERVICES.  The economic health of the taconite  industry  continues to be
adversely  impacted by cheap foreign steel  imports.  With the closure of LTV in
January  2001  and  various  temporary  shutdowns  at other  Minnesota  taconite
facilities,  the current taconite  production level for 2001 is now estimated to
be  approximately 35 million tons. In October 2001 we executed an agreement with
LTV and  Cleveland-Cliffs  to acquire LTV's 225 MW generating facility and other
non-mining assets for $75 million. One of the three 75 MW units in this facility
is expected to be on-line in January 2002.  Our power  purchase  agreement  with
Lakefield  Junction  for 240 MW which began in June 2001,  extends to April 2003
and declines to 80 MW from May 2003 to April 2004. It provides  additional power
to sell in the wholesale  market. We recently  initiated the permitting  process
for a 160 MW peaking plant in Superior,  Wisconsin and a 225 MW energy  facility
at Blandin Paper in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Overall, we believe Energy Services
is well positioned for future growth opportunities.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES  acquisitions made during 2000 and early 2001, and continued
growth of AFC's  vehicle  finance  business,  contributed  significantly  to net
income for the first nine months of 2001.  Even with the events of September 11,
we continue to expect that  Automotive  Services'  2001 net income  contribution
will be about 40 percent  over last  year.  We also  expect  that  EBITDAL  from
same-store ADESA auction facilities will increase 10 percent to 15 percent.

In 2001,  industry-wide sales of used vehicles at auction have been down due to
pricing  pressure in the used vehicle market.  The pricing pressure is partially
caused by aggressive  incentives  currently offered by vehicle  manufacturers on
new  vehicles.  We continue to believe that used  vehicle  sales within the auto
auction industry will rise at a rate of 2 percent to 4 percent annually over the
next several years.

WATER  SERVICES.  Even  though  Florida  and North  Carolina  had  above-average
rainfall during the second and third quarters of 2001 and water use restrictions
remain in effect, Water Services' 2001 financial results are still on target due
to customer growth in both Florida and North Carolina.

In September 2001 we announced that  discussions  with the Florida  Governmental
Utility  Authority  (Authority) are underway  regarding the possible purchase by
the Authority of all of the water,  wastewater and water reuse assets of Florida
Water.  We  entered  into  an  agreement  giving  the  Authority  the  exclusive
opportunity through December 21, 2001 to review a potential transaction. We will
be examining alternative strategies for redeployment of the proceeds if the sale
occurs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES

During the first nine months of 2001 cash flow from operations  reflected strong
operating  results  and  continued  focus on  working  capital  management.  The
decrease in cash flow from  operations  in 2001 was  primarily  attributable  to
changes  in trading  securities.  In 2001  additional  trading  securities  were
purchased  with a portion of the proceeds from our second  quarter  common stock
issuance (see Securities  below),  while in 2000 trading securities were sold to
partially  fund the  acquisition of Auction  Finance Group,  Inc. Cash flow from
operations  was also  affected by a number of factors  representative  of normal
operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper.  Our  securities  investments  can be
liquidated  to  provide  funds  for  reinvestment  in  existing   businesses  or
acquisition of new businesses.  Approximately  5.5 million original issue shares
of our common stock are available for issuance through INVEST DIRECT, our direct
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided.  However, ADESA has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC also has  arrangements  to use proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper
issued by ALLETE to meet its  operational  requirements.  AFC offers  short-term
on-site financing for dealers to purchase vehicles at auctions in exchange for a
security  interest in those  vehicles.  The  financing  is provided  through the
earlier of the date the dealer sells the vehicle or a general  borrowing term of
30 to 45 days.

AFC sells certain  finance  receivables on a revolving  basis to a wholly owned,
unconsolidated,  qualified special purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn
sells,  on  a  revolving  basis,  an  undivided  interest  in  eligible  finance
receivables,  up to a maximum at any one time  outstanding  of $300 million,  to
third party  purchasers  under an agreement  that expires at the end of 2002. At
September  30, 2001 AFC had sold $403.1  million of finance  receivables  to the
special purpose  subsidiary  ($335.7 million at December 31, 2000).  Third party
purchasers had purchased an undivided interest in finance  receivables of $283.0
million from this subsidiary at September 30, 2001 ($239 million at December 31,
2000). Unsold finance receivables and unfinanced receivables held by the special
purpose  subsidiary are recorded by AFC as residual interest at fair value. Fair
value is based upon  estimates  of future cash  flows,  using  assumptions  that
market participants would use to value such instruments,  including estimates of
anticipated  credit  losses  over  the  life  of the  receivables  sold  without
application of a discount rate due to the short-term  nature of the  receivables
sold. The fair value of AFC's residual  interest was $116.9 million at September
30, 2001 ($106.2  million at December 31,  2000).  Proceeds from the sale of the
receivables were used to repay borrowings from ALLETE and fund vehicle inventory
purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
September 30, 2001 compared to December 31, 2000 were due to increased sales and
financing  activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down
during the winter months and in December  because of the holidays.  As a result,
both ADESA and AFC had higher  receivables  and higher payables at September 30,
2001.

ACQUISITIONS.  In  January  2001 we  acquired  all of the  outstanding  stock of
ComSearch in exchange  for ALLETE  common stock and paid cash to purchase all of
the assets of Auto Placement  Center (now ADESA Impact) in transactions  with an
aggregate  value of $62.4  million.  ADESA  Impact  was funded  with  internally
generated  funds and short-term  debt which was refinanced  with long-term debt.
(See  Securities  below.)  ADESA  Impact is a provider of "total  loss"  vehicle
recovery  services with 12 auction  facilities in the United  States.  ComSearch
provides  Internet-based  parts location and insurance adjustment audit services
nationwide. Both ADESA Impact and ComSearch are based in Rhode Island.

In February 2001 ALLETE Water  Services  completed the purchase of the assets of
Dicks  Creek,  a wastewater  utility  located near  Atlanta,  Georgia,  for $6.6
million  plus a  commitment  to pay  the  seller  a fee for  future  residential
connections.  The commitment  requires payment of a minimum of $400,000 annually
beginning December 31, 2001 for four years or until cumulative payments reach $2
million,  whichever  occurs first.  The  transaction  was funded with internally
generated funds.

In May 2001  ADESA  purchased  the  assets  of the I-44 Auto  Auction  in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The I-44 Auto Auction, which is located on 75 acres, was renamed ADESA
Tulsa and offers six  auction  lanes,  storage  for over  3,000  vehicles  and a
five-bay  reconditioning  and detail  facility.  The transaction was funded with
internally generated funds.

In July 2001 we acquired Enventis, a data network systems provider headquartered
in the  Minneapolis-  St. Paul area. In  connection  with this  acquisition,  we
issued  310,878 shares of our common stock.  This  transaction  complements  our
existing infrastructure and fiber optics network in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and
helps position our telecommunications  business as one of the leading integrated
data service providers in the Upper Midwest.

In  October  2001  we  executed  an  asset  purchase   agreement  with  LTV  and
Cleveland-Cliffs  to  acquire  certain  non-mining  properties  from LTV for $75
million.  The  non-mining  properties  include LTV's 225 MW electric  generating
facility and existing coal pile at Taconite  Harbor,  a sixty-mile  transmission
line,  railroad trackage rights,  and  approximately  30,000 acres of forest and
recreation  land in northeast  Minnesota.  The  transaction is expected to close
during the fourth quarter.

SECURITIES.  In February 2001 we issued $125 million of 7.80% Senior Notes,  due
February 15, 2008.  Proceeds were used to repay a portion of ALLETE's short-term
bank borrowings  incurred for the  acquisition of vehicle auction  facilities in
2000 and early 2001 and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2001 ALLETE,  ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III, jointly filed a
registration  statement  with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under the  Securities
Act of 1933. The registration  statement,  which has been declared  effective by
the SEC,  relates  to the  possible  issuance,  from  time to time  when  market
conditions  and the  needs of ALLETE  warrant,  of an  aggregate  amount of $500
million of securities  which may include  ALLETE common  stock,  first  mortgage
bonds,  and other debt  securities  and ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III
preferred  trust  securities,   of  which  approximately  $387  million  remains
available to be issued.  ALLETE also previously filed a registration  statement,
which has been declared effective by the SEC, relating to the possible issuance,
from time to time when market conditions and the needs of ALLETE warrant, of $25
million of first mortgage bonds and other debt securities.  We may sell all or a
portion of the remaining registered securities if warranted by market conditions
and  our  capital  requirements.  Any  offer  and  sale of the  above  mentioned
securities will be made only by means of a prospectus  meeting the  requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.

On May 30,  2001 we  issued  and sold in an  underwritten  public  offering  6.5
million  shares  of  common  stock  at  $23.68  per  share.   In  addition,   an
over-allotment  option for 100,000  shares at $23.68 per share was  exercised by
the  underwriters  and sold on June 7, 2001.  Total net proceeds of $150 million
were used to repay a portion of our  short-term  borrowings  with the  remainder
invested in short-term instruments.  The increase in the number of shares of our
common stock  outstanding  as of September 30, 2001 had an immaterial  impact on
earnings per share for the 2001 periods.

INVESTMENTS.  As companies included in our emerging  technology  investments are
sold, we may  recognize a gain or loss.  In the second half of 2000,  several of
the private  companies  included in our  emerging  technology  investments  went
public by completing initial public offerings. Typically, investors in a private
company are not  permitted to sell stock in the company for a period of 180 days
following the company's initial public offering.  Other restrictions on sale may
also apply and certain shares are held  indirectly by us through our investments
in independent  investment funds.  Since going public, the market value of these
companies has experienced  significant  volatility,  particularly  following the
events of September 11. Our  investment  in the companies  that have gone public
has a cost basis of approximately $12 million. The aggregate market value of our
investment in these companies at September 30, 2001 was $14 million.

<PAGE>

Our  emerging  technology  investments  provide  us with  access  to  developing
technologies  before their  commercial  debut,  as well as  potential  financial
returns and diversification opportunities. We view these investments as a source
of capital for  redeployment in existing  businesses.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2001
totaled $108.4 million ($94.0 million in 2000).  Expenditures  for 2001 included
$43.0 million for Energy  Services,  $43.0 million for  Automotive  Services and
$22.4 million for Water Services. Internally generated funds and the issuance of
long-term debt were the primary sources of funding for these expenditures.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In July  2001  the FASB  issued  SFAS  141,  142 and 143.  SFAS  141,  "Business
Combinations"  requires  that the purchase  method of accounting be used for all
business  combinations  initiated  after June 30,  2001.  Use of the  pooling of
interests  method of accounting  will be prohibited.  We do not have any pending
acquisitions that will be impacted by this new rule.

SFAS 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets"  changes the  accounting for
goodwill  from  an   amortization   method  to  an   impairment-only   approach.
Amortization of goodwill will cease January 1, 2002, the date we expect to adopt
this  standard.  We have $536 million of goodwill as of  September  30, 2001 and
after-tax goodwill amortization expense of approximately $8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2001. Annual after-tax goodwill  amortization expense
is expected to be  approximately  $11 million in 2001. We do not believe we have
any goodwill impairment at this time.

SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" requires the recognition
of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in which it is
incurred.  When the liability is initially recorded,  the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time, the liability
is  accreted  to its  present  value  and  the  related  capitalized  charge  is
depreciated over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal
years  beginning  after June 15, 2002. We are currently  reviewing the impact of
SFAS 143 on the Company.

In August 2001 the FASB  issued  SFAS 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 addresses  accounting and reporting for
the  impairment  or disposal of long-lived  assets,  including the disposal of a
segment of business.  SFAS 144 is effective  for fiscal  years  beginning  after
December  15,  2001,  with  earlier  application  encouraged.  We are  currently
reviewing the impact of SFAS 144 on the Company.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our  securities  portfolio  has exposure to both price and  interest  rate risk.
Investments  held  principally  for  near-term  sale are  classified  as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies.  In strategies  designed to hedge
overall market risks, we also sell common stock short.  Investments  held for an
indefinite  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale  securities and
also recorded at fair value. Available-for-sale securities consist of our direct
investments in emerging  technology  companies and securities in a grantor trust
established to fund certain employee benefits.

On August 9, 2001  Minnesota  Power  announced  plans to build a 160 MW  natural
gas-fired electric  generating facility near Superior,  Wisconsin,  to help meet
the  region's  energy  needs  during  times  of  peak  electrical   demand.  The
construction  cost is  estimated  to be between $70 million and $80 million with
completion  in late 2003  contingent  on the  timely  receipt of  approvals  and
permits.

state-of-the-art  225 MW energy  facility  adjacent  to  Blandin  Paper in Grand
Rapids, Minnesota, through a partnering arrangement. A new company, Rapids Power
LLC, was created to own the  facility.  Through a subsidiary we own 71.5 percent
of Rapids Power LLC and Blandin Paper Company, a subsidiary of UPM-Kymmene, owns
28.5 percent. The project,  which is expected to cost more than $200 million, is
contingent  on timely  receipt of  necessary  federal  and state  approvals  and
permits.  Construction  could  begin  in the  fall of  2002  and is  slated  for
completion in mid-2005.

Effective  September 12, 2001 the PSCW approved a 12.25 percent return on common
equity and a 1.1  percent  average  increase in retail  utility  rates for SWL&P
customers.  This  average  increase is  comprised  of a 3.4 percent  decrease in
electric rates, a 1.5 percent  increase in gas rates and a 24.5 percent increase
in water rates.  The water increase is designed to recover the cost of replacing
an aging well system.  SWL&P originally  requested an average increase in retail
utility rates of 1.8 percent which was later increased to 2.5 percent.

                              RETIREMENT AGREEMENT


          THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of August 28, 2001, between
ALLETE,  INC.  (f/k/a/  Minnesota  Power,  Inc.), a Minnesota  corporation  (the
"Company"), and EDWIN L. RUSSELL ("Russell").


                                    RECITALS

          A. Russell  has  been   employed  as  Chairman,  President  and  Chief
Executive  Officer of the Company and,  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
resigns from these and all other  positions  with the  Company,  effective as of
August 28, 2001,  and as an employee of the Company,  effective as of August 31,
2001.

          B. This  Agreement  sets  forth  the  complete  understanding  between
Russell and the Company regarding the commitments and obligations arising out of
the termination of their employment relationship.

          NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual obligations  incurred
and benefits  obtained  hereunder,  the  sufficiency of which are admitted,  the
Company and Russell agree as follows:


                                    AGREEMENT

          1. RESIGNATION.  Effective as of August 28, 2001, Russell resigns from
(a) his  positions as Chairman,  President  and Chief  Executive  Officer of the
Company, (b) his membership on the Company's Board of Directors, (c) any and all
other positions held by Russell with the Company,  except as an employee, or any
of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any of the Boards of Directors thereof, and
(d) any positions as fiduciary or trustee of any Company benefit plan. Effective
as of midnight on August 31, 2001 ("Separation Date"),  Russell resigns his sole
remaining  position  as an  employee of the  Company.  Russell  has, on the date
hereof,  confirmed his resignation from such positions by submitting a letter of
resignation  to the Company  substantially  in the form attached as EXHIBIT A to
this  Agreement.  Notwithstanding  Russell's  continued  status  as an  employee
through midnight August 31, 2001,  Russell shall not take or perform any actions
in such  capacity and shall remain an employee  solely for purposes of receiving
through such date his base compensation, vacation accrual, and continued benefit
plan accruals.

          2. BENEFITS.  In  consideration  for the  release of  claims set forth
below and other obligations under this Agreement, the Company has made or agrees
to make or provide the following benefits to Russell:

             (a) SALARY.  On or before  September  7, 2001,  the  Company  shall
          deliver to Russell $215,333,  which amount is equal to the base salary
          he would have earned from September 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001 if he
          would have  continued  in the employ of the Company.  In addition,  on
          January 2, 2002, the Company shall deliver to Russell $509,066,  which
          amount  represents  8/12ths  of the bonus  payment  made to Russell in
          2000.  Russell  shall not be  entitled  to any  other  salary or bonus
          payment with respect to 2001 or any portion thereof or any prior or
          subsequent period.


<PAGE>

             (b) STOCK OPTION TERMS. The parties  acknowledge that Russell holds
          the following  unexercised  non-qualified  stock options granted under
          the Company's Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan:


             DATE OF GRANT             OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AS OF 8/28/2001
             -------------             -----------------------------------

             December 31, 1998                     19,696
             January 4, 1999                       40,000
             June 1, 1999                          15,890
             July 1, 1999                          19,297 (replacement options)
             July 1, 1999                          19,054 (replacement options)
             January 3, 2000                       87,466
             January 2, 2001                       55,064
                                  Total            276,771

          Contingent upon Russell's  execution of this  Agreement,  the Company,
          through the  Compensation  Committee  of its Board of  Directors,  has
          approved (1) the amendment of those  Company stock options  previously
          granted to Russell,  as described  above,  to provide that the term of
          each  shall  expire on August  31,  2004,  the  third  anniversary  of
          Russell's resignation, (2) the amendment of the January 3, 2000 option
          to  accelerate  the vesting of 43,733  unvested  options to August 31,
          2001,  and  (3)  the  amendment  of the  January  2,  2001  option  to
          accelerate the vesting of 27,532 unvested  options to August 31, 2001,
          and that as a result of these actions an aggregate of 249,239  options
          shall be vested  and  exercisable  through  the close of  business  on
          August 31, 2004.

          Russell's exercise of all or any portion of the 249,239 vested options
          shall be governed exclusively by the respective stock option agreement
          and the Executive Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation Plan, except that
          there shall be no reload  feature  with respect to any of such 249,239
          options whenever  exercised,  including any options exercised prior to
          termination  of  employment  status on August 31,  2001.  All unvested
          options are forfeited  and, in the event Russell has not exercised the
          249,239 vested  options by August 31, 2004,  such vested options shall
          also be forfeited.  Russell  acknowledges  that all vested options are
          non-qualified  stock  options  so that,  upon  exercise  of his  stock
          options,  he will recognize (and be taxed as) ordinary  income for the
          excess  of the then  fair  market  value of the  stock  acquired  upon
          exercise of the option over the purchase price for the stock acquired.

             (c) PERFORMANCE  SHARES. On account of the 1,813 performance shares
          awarded   to  Russell   under  the   Executive   Long-Term   Incentive
          Compensation  Plan for the  performance  period  from  January 1, 1998
          through  December  31, 1999,  Russell  shall be entitled to receive an
          amount in cash equal to the remaining  25% of the award  (representing
          1,813 shares) based upon the Company's  actual results  against target
          over the full performance period,  payable on January 2, 2002. Russell
          shall not be entitled to any  performance  shares with  respect to the
          2000-01  performance  period or any portion  thereof or any subsequent
          period.

          determined  as of the close of  business  on the  Separation  Date and
          payable to Russell  within  thirty (30) days  thereafter.  The parties
          acknowledge   that  a  portion  of  such  account   balance  shall  be

          Plan  account or to  roll-over  the amount in his account at the times

          Russell has made a $4,000 medical reimbursement  election for calendar
          year 2001 under the  Company's  Medical  Reimbursement  Plan.  Russell

<PAGE>

          Company will reimburse Russell up to a maximum of $12,000 per year for
          the  cost  of  such  coverage.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  all
          insurance  benefits  to be  provided  under  this  Section  2(i) shall
          terminate  when Russell  becomes a  participant  under  another  group
          insurance  plan through a new  employer or Russell  reaches the age of
          65, whichever occurs first.  Russell agrees to notify the Company when
          he begins participation in another group plan.

             (j)  VACATION  PAY.  Within  ten (10)  days  after the date of this
          Agreement,  the Company shall deliver to Russell a lump-sum payment in
          respect of Russell's  accrued,  unused  vacation days as of August 31,
          2001.

             (k) SPLIT DOLLAR INSURANCE. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
          effective as of the date hereof, the Split Dollar Insurance Agreement,
          the related Compensation  Agreement and the transactions  contemplated
          thereby are terminated  without any further  liability by one party to
          the other. Effective the date of this Agreement,  the Company shall be
          the  sole and  exclusive  owner of such  split-dollar  life  insurance
          policy,  including all rights to continue the insurance or receive any
          cash values.  Russell  represents that he has not and will not modify,
          alter or take any  action to  receive  any  benefits  under such Split
          Dollar Insurance, including receiving or using any cash value or other
          policy  right to reduce the amount to be  received by the Company as a
          result of its payment of the premiums on such policy.  Russell  agrees
          to execute, or cause to be executed, appropriate assignments to effect
          the  transfer  to  the  Company  of  all  policy   rights  under  such
          split-dollar  life  insurance  policy,  including  the  cash  value of
          $684,271.00.

             (l) TRANSFER  OF  AUTOMOBILE.  The  Company  agrees  to transfer to
          Russell by September 17, 2001 the ownership of the Cadillac automobile
          that Russell has used.  Russell shall be responsible for all insurance
          and  maintenance   costs  associated  with  the  automobile.   Russell
          acknowledges  that the transfer of ownership  of the  automobile  will
          constitute income to him and that he is responsible for the payment of
          any federal income tax and any other taxes due upon transfer.

             (m) OUTPLACEMENT.  The  Company  agrees  to pay  up to  Twenty-Five
          Thousand Dollars  ($25,000) for  outplacement  and other  professional
          services provided to Russell, subject to the submission of appropriate
          documentation from the service provider(s).

             (n) BUSINESS EXPENSES.  The Company shall reimburse Russell for all
          business  expenses  incurred in the ordinary of business by Russell on
          or before the date hereof, but not submitted for reimbursement at such
          date, to the extent  reimbursable  under the Company's  normal expense
          reimbursement  policies and procedures and submitted for payment on or
          before October 1, 2001.

             (o) TAX  GROSS-UP.  The Company  agrees to pay Russell  that amount
          which is  necessary to  reimburse  him on an  after-tax  basis for any

          the basis consistent with past practice.

             (p) OFFICE SPACE. The Company shall, upon submission of appropriate
          documentation,  pay up to $2,000 monthly to maintain  office space and
          part-time executive

<PAGE>

          secretarial  support for Russell  through May 31, 2002,  at a location
          selected by Russell that is acceptable to the Company.

          3. WITHHOLDING.  All amounts  payable by  the Company to Russell under
Section 2 above shall be reduced for any applicable withholding taxes

          4. OTHER  BENEFITS.  Except as expressly  provided in this  Agreement,
Russell will not be eligible to  participate  in any of the  Company's  employee
benefit plans after the date of this Agreement.  Russell  acknowledges  that the
designation of this agreement as a Retirement  Agreement  shall not be deemed to
constitute a  "retirement"  for  purposes of any plan,  policy or benefit of the
Company since Russell has not attained the requisite  number of years of service
or age to qualify for retirement benefits.

          5. FULL  COMPENSATION.  Russell  acknowledges  and  agrees   that  the
payments  that will be made to Russell or for his benefit and the  extension  of
the time within which to exercise his vested  stock  options  provided for under
this Agreement will  compensate him for and extinguish any and all of his claims
arising  out of his  employment  and other  positions  with the  Company and the
termination of his employment  and other  positions with the Company,  including
but not limited to all of his claims for any type of legal or  equitable  relief
under  any  agreement,  policy,  plan,  handbook  or  procedure  of the  Company
applicable to Russell in any capacity.  Nothing in this  Agreement  shall affect
Russell's right to unpaid salary or benefits under the applicable  plans through
the August 31 Separation Date.

          6. MUTUAL  GENERAL  RELEASES.  Except  with  respect  to the  parties'
respective rights and obligations under this Agreement,  each of Russell and the
Company, and their respective representatives, successors and assigns, agrees to
release and forever  discharge  one  another  and their  respective  affiliates,
subsidiaries,  predecessors,  successors,  related  entities,  insurers  and the
current and former  officers,  directors,  shareholders,  employees,  attorneys,
agents  and  trustees  or  administrators  of any  benefit  plan  of each of the
foregoing (any and all of which are referred to as  "Releasees")  generally from
any and  all  charges,  complaints,  claims,  promises,  agreements,  causes  of
actions,  damages,  and  debts  of  any  nature  whatsoever,  known  or  unknown
(collectively  "Claims"),  which either party have,  claim to have, ever had, or
ever  claimed to have had against  Releasees up through the date of execution of
this Agreement,  including but not limited to any Claims under the common law or
any statute.

          7. REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS BY RUSSELL.

             (a)  NO  PENDING  CLAIMS.  Russell  hereby  represents,   with  the
          knowledge   and  intent   that  the   Company   will  rely  upon  such
          representations in entering into this Agreement, that he has not filed
          any action,  complaint,  charge,  grievance or arbitration against the
          Company or any of its successors,  assigns, subsidiaries,  affiliates,
          directors,  officers,  employees,  attorneys,  agents and  trustees or

          liabilities  which  are to be  released  by this  Agreement,  nor will
          Russell seek to challenge the validity of this Agreement,  except that
          this  covenant  not to sue does not affect  Russell's  future right to
          enforce  in a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  the  terms  of this
          Agreement.

             (c) RECORDS,  DOCUMENTS,  PROPERTY.  Upon  his  execution  of  this
          Agreement,  Russell  will  promptly  return to the Company (i) all its

          his  possession  at the time he  signs  this  Agreement,  and (ii) all
          property of the Company, including corporate credit cards and keys, in
          his  possession at the time he signs this  Agreement.  Russell  hereby
          represents that he has returned, or, within 15 calendar days after the
          date of this Agreement, will return to the Company all of its property
          in his possession or under his control, including, without limitation,
          keys, badges,  computer disks, financial  information,  reports, other
          documents  and  copies  of  same.   Russell   understands  that  these
          representations  are  material,  and the  Company  is relying on these
          representations in entering into this Agreement.

          8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

             (a) DEFINITION. Russell recognizes that by virtue of his employment
          with the Company,  Russell has acquired certain non-public information
          with  respect to the Company  and its  operations  (the  "Confidential
          Information").   Russell   recognizes   and   acknowledges   that  the
          Confidential  Information  constitutes  valuable,  special  and unique
          assets of the Company, access to and knowledge of which were essential
          to the performance of Russell's duties during his employment.

             (b) NON-DISCLOSURE.  Russell   agrees  to  hold  the   Confidential
          Information  in  trust  and  confidence.  Russell  agrees  not  to (i)
          directly or indirectly make use of the Confidential Information,  (ii)
          reveal  any  Confidential  Information  to any other  party,  or (iii)
          divulge or use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than
          for the benefit of the Company,  except and to the extent  Russell may
          be  required  to  disclose  by lawful  order or process of a court (in
          which event  Russell will provide  reasonable  advance  notice of such
          disclosure  to the  Company  and will  cooperate  with  the  Company's
          efforts to obtain protective treatment for such information).

          9.  NON-DISPARAGEMENT.   Except  to  enforce  the  parties  rights  in
accordance with Section 12 of this Agreement,  each party further agrees that it
or he will not, and the Company agrees that its officers and directors shall not
disparage,  criticize,  or make negative  comments about the other or its or his
officers, directors,  employees, suppliers or customers and will not do anything
to harm the  other  or its or his  business  or to  interfere  with the  other's
relations with its or his employees, suppliers or customers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  the parties agree that any statements  made that are consistent with
the press  release  issued by the Company on the date  hereof  shall not violate
their respective  obligations  under this Section 9 of the Agreement.  A copy of
the press release is attached as Exhibit B to this Agreement.

          10. ASSISTANCE  WITH   CLAIMS   INVOLVING  OR   BY  THE  COMPANY.   In
consideration  of the  consideration  provided to Russell under Section 2 above,
Russell  agrees that,  at anytime  hereafter,  he will make  himself  reasonably
available to the Company  (consistent  with any obligations  Russell may have to
any future employer or business in which he engages) for consultation (including

                                       6
<PAGE>

appearance as a witness for the Company) regarding the Company's past operations
or any pending or future lawsuits  involving or by the Company or its affiliates
where Russell has or may have knowledge of the underlying  facts.  Russell shall
be  reimbursed  by the  Company  for  reasonable  travel  expenses  incurred  in
providing  such  assistance.  In  addition,  Russell will not  voluntarily  aid,
assist,  or cooperate  with any actual or potential  claimants or  plaintiffs or
their  attorneys  or agents in any claims or lawsuits  proposed to be  asserted,
pending or commenced on the date hereof or in the future  against the Company or
its  affiliates;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER,  that  nothing in this  Agreement  will  be
construed to prevent Russell from  testifying at an  administrative  hearing,  a
deposition,  or in court in response to a lawful  subpoena in any  litigation or
proceeding involving the Company.

          11. INDEMNIFICATION. Russell will be entitled, as a former employee or
officer or director of the Company, to the same rights as are afforded to senior
executive  officers  or  directors  of the  Company  now or in  the  future,  to
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in the charter documents of
the Company,  or under applicable law, and to coverage and a legal defense under
any applicable  general  liability  and/or  directors'  and officers'  liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company.

          12. ARBITRATION.

              (a) NOTICE AND SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR. The parties agree that any
          dispute arising under this  Agreement,  other than an action at law or
          in equity by the  Company to seek  damages  for or to seek  injunctive
          relief against  Russell for a violation of any provision of Sections 7
          and 8,  shall be  submitted  to  arbitration  before  a  disinterested
          arbitrator.  Arbitration  shall be  commenced  by service on the other
          party to the dispute by a written request for arbitration,  containing
          a brief description of the matter at issue and the names and addresses
          of three  arbitrators  acceptable to the  petitioner.  The other party
          shall within thirty (30) days following  receipt of such notice either
          select  one of the  proposed  arbitrators  or  provide  the  names and
          addresses  of three  other  arbitrators  acceptable  to the  proposing
          party.  If the  parties  are  unable to agree to the  selection  of an
          arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be chosen impartially by the American
          Arbitration   Association.   The  arbitration   shall  take  place  in
          Minneapolis,  Minnesota  if  initiated by Russell and, if initiated by
          the Company in Chicago, Illinois.

              (b) RULES  OF  PROCEEDING.   Arbitration   proceedings  shall   be
          conducted  under the commercial  rules then prevailing of the American
          Arbitration  Association.  The  arbitrator  shall  not be bound to any
          formal rules of evidence or  procedure,  and may consider such matters
          as  a   reasonable   business   person  would  take  into  account  in
          decision-making.

              (c) DECISION  FINAL AND BINDING.  The decision of the  arbitrator
          shall be final and  binding on the  parties,  and may be  entered  and
          enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

              (d) EXPENSES. The expenses of the arbitrator and other arbitration
          expenses  shall be paid by the party who does not  prevail in whole or
          significant part (the "prevailing party"). Attorney fees, witness fees
          and other expenses  incurred by the prevailing  party in preparing for
          or presenting that party's case in the  arbitration  are  "arbitration
          expenses"  for  purposes of this  Section  12(d).  The decision of the
          arbitrator

                                       7
<PAGE>
          shall include a determination  as to the party which is the prevailing
          party and the  arbitration  expenses to be paid by the  non-prevailing
          party.

          13. ADVICE TO  CONSULT  WITH  AN  ATTORNEY.  Russell  understands  and
acknowledges that he is being advised by the Company to consult with an attorney
prior to signing this Agreement.  Russell  represents that he has consulted with
an attorney to the extent that he thinks appropriate.  Russell has not relied on
any  explanations,  statements  or promises made by the Company or its agents or
attorneys other than as set forth in this Agreement.

          14. CONFIDENTIALITY.

              (a) TERMS OF AGREEMENT. Russell and the Company agree that neither
          of them shall reveal or publicize the  existence of this  Agreement or
          its terms,  except under  compulsion of law and as required  under the
          rules  and  regulations  of the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission
          ("SEC").  Russell  acknowledges  that a copy of this Agreement will be
          filed as an exhibit to a filing made by the  Company  with the SEC and
          that a  description  of  compensation  paid or to be paid to him under
          this  Agreement  will be included in the  Company's  proxy  statement.
          Notwithstanding  the provisions of this Section 14(a), the parties may
          discuss  the  existence  and  terms  of  this   Agreement  with  their
          respective attorneys, accountants and financial advisors to the extent
          necessary  to obtain  counsel and advice  therefrom.  Russell may also
          discuss the existence and terms of this Agreement with his spouse.

              (b)  EMPLOYMENT  REFERENCES.  In the event a prospective  employer
          contacts  the  Company for an  employment  reference  with  respect to
          Russell,  the Company  shall not provide any  information  relating to
          Russell or his  employment  history or  performance  with the  Company
          except through such persons as Russell may from time to time designate
          in writing to the Company.

          15. COSTS.  Except as  provided  in  Sections  2(m) and  12(d) of this
Agreement,  each  party  shall  bear its own  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in
connection  with the  negotiation of this Agreement and the  preparation of this
Agreement.

          16. NO ADMISSION.  Russell  agrees that neither this Agreement nor the
furnishing of the  consideration for this Agreement shall be deemed or construed
at any time for any purpose as an admission  by the Company of any  liability or
unlawful conduct of any kind.

          17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
and  understanding   between  the  Company  and  Russell  concerning   Russell's
separation  from the  Company,  and  supersedes  and  replaces any and all prior
agreements and understandings concerning Russell's relationship with the Company
and his compensation by the Company.

          18. SEVERABILITY.  In the event any one or more of the  provisions of
this Agreement  becomes or is declared by a court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect without said provision.

          19. VOLUNTARY  EXECUTION  OF  AGREEMENT.  This  Agreement is  executed
voluntarily  and without any duress or undue  influence on the part or behalf of
the parties  hereto,  with the full intent
