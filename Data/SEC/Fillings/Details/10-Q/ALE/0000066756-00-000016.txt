                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"
"expects,"  "intends,"  "plans,"  "predicts,"  "projects," "will likely result,"
"will continue," or similar  expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

          - prevailing  governmental  policies and regulatory actions, including
            those of Congress, state legislatures, the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC,
            the NCUC and the PSCW,  with  respect  to  allowed  rates of return,
            industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal of assets and
            facilities, operation and construction of plant facilities, recovery
            of purchased  power and other  capital  investments,  and present or
            prospective  wholesale  and retail  competition  (including  but not
            limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs);
          - economic and geographic factors including political and economic
            risks;
          - changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
            policies;
          - weather conditions;
          - population growth rates and demographic patterns;
          - competition for retail and wholesale customers;
          - pricing and transportation of commodities;
          - market demand, including structural market changes;
          - changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
          - changes in project costs;
          - unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital
            expenditures;
          - capital market conditions;
          - competition for new energy development opportunities; and
          - legal  and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil  or
            criminal)  and  settlements  that  influence  the  business  and
            profitability of the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Florida First  District Court
of Appeals (Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform
rates for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With  "uniform  rates" all
customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and  wastewater
services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
ordered  Florida Water to issue  refunds to those  customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge to  customers  who paid
less under uniform rates. Florida Water appealed, and the Court of Appeals ruled
in June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without balancing surcharges.
In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC issued an order in January
1998 that did not require refunds. Florida Water's potential refund liability at
that time was about $12.5  million,  which included  interest,  to customers who
paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund,  with
interest,  $2.5 million, the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service
area from January 1996 through June 1997 under uniform rates which  exceeded the
amount  these  customers  would  have paid  under a  modified  stand-alone  rate
structure.  No balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund
because  Spring  Hill  customers  continued  to pay  uniform  rates  after other
customers  began  paying  modified  stand-alone  rates  effective  January  1996
pursuant to the FPSC's interim rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case. The
FPSC did not include  Spring Hill in this  interim rate order  because  Hernando
County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida
Water  reached an agreement  with  Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to
stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund because the FPSC
had no  authority  to order  uniform  rates.  The Company has  appealed the $2.5
million  refund order.  Initial briefs were filed by all parties in May 1998. In
June 1998 the Court of Appeals  reversed its  previous  ruling that the FPSC was
without  authority  to  order  uniform  rates  at  which  time  customer  groups
supporting  the  FPSC's  January  1998  order  filed a motion  with the Court of
Appeals  seeking  dismissal of the appeal by customer  groups  seeking  refunds.
Customers  seeking  refunds filed amended briefs in September  1998. A mediation
session was held in September  1999.  The parties could not reach  settlement of
any issues.  A provision for refund related to the $2.5 million refund order was
recorded in 1999. The parties await the establishment of a briefing schedule.  A
decision  is not  expected  before  2001.  The  Company is unable to predict the
timing or outcome of the appeals process.

NOTE 4.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the  quarter  ended  March 31,  2000  total  comprehensive  income was $49.0
million   ($21.9   million  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  1999).   Total
comprehensive  income  includes  net  income,  unrealized  gains  and  losses on
securities  classified as  available-for-sale,  and foreign currency translation
adjustments.

NOTE 5.    ACQUISITIONS

ADESA  AUCTION  FACILITIES.  On January 1, 2000 ADESA  Canada  Inc.  acquired an
additional 26 percent of Impact Auto Auctions Ltd.  bringing the total ownership
percentage  to 73 percent.  The Company  anticipates  acquiring the remaining 27
percent  by the end of 2000.  Impact  Auto  Auctions  Ltd.  is a  business  that
auctions salvaged vehicles at several locations in Canada.

On February 7, 2000 ADESA  purchased the Mission City Auto Auction in San Diego,
California.  The  transaction  was  accounted  for  using the  purchase  method.
Financial  results have been  included in the Company's  consolidated  financial
statements since the date of purchase. Pro forma financial results have not been
presented due to immateriality. The Mission City auction, which has been renamed
ADESA San Diego, operates six auction lanes on 30 acres with full reconditioning
facilities. AFC has opened an office at ADESA San Diego.

The  transactions  described  in the two  preceding  paragraphs  had a  combined
purchase price of $15.7  million.  The Company  funded these  transactions  with
internally generated funds.

NOTE 6.    LONG-TERM DEBT

On March 30, 2000 ADESA issued $35 million of 8.10% Senior Notes,  Series B, due
March 30, 2010.  Proceeds were used to refinance  short-term  bank  indebtedness
incurred for the acquisition of vehicle auction facilities purchased in 1999 and
for general corporate purposes.

NOTE 7.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company  has a power  purchase  agreement  with  Square  Butte that  extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in the Company's electric service territory and enables the Company to
meet power pool reserve  requirements.  Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center,
North Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit owned by Minnkota Power
Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative corporation whose Class
A members are also members of Square Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of
the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

The Company is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under
the Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance notice
requirement,  Minnkota has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement  by 5
percent  annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  The Company is obligated to pay
its pro rata share of Square Butte's costs based on the Company's entitlement to
Unit output. The Company's payment obligation is suspended if Square Butte fails
to deliver any power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one year.
Square Butte's fixed costs consist primarily of debt service.  At March 31, 2000
Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $329.6  million.  Total annual debt
service for Square Butte is expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of
the years 2000 through 2003 and $23 million in 2004.  Variable  operating  costs
include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI Coal, a  subsidiary  of Minnesota
Power,  under a long-term  contract.  The Company's payments to Square Butte are
approved as purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and
FERC.

NET INCOME

The  following  net  income  discussion  summarizes  significant  events for the
quarter ended March 31, 2000.

Electric  Services  reflected stable net income in 2000 and strong  megawatthour
sales. An 11 percent  increase in megawatthour  sales was offset by lower demand
revenue from large industrial customers and higher purchased power expenses.

Automotive  Services  reported  higher  net  income in 2000 due to a 13  percent
increase in the number of vehicles sold through ADESA auction  facilities  and a
31  percent  increase  in the number of  vehicles  financed  through  AFC's loan
production offices.

Water Services  generated higher net income in 2000. Water consumption was up 17
percent in 2000 as a result of customer  growth,  one  additional  month of PCUC
operations and drier weather conditions.

Investments  reported higher net income in 2000 because of significant  sales by
the  Company's  real  estate  operations,  improved  returns  on  the  Company's
securities  portfolio  and gains on  intermediate-term  investments  in emerging
technologies relating to the electric industry.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 AND 1999

OPERATING REVENUE

Electric   Services   operating   revenue  was  $9.4  million  higher  in  2000.
Megawatthour sales were up 11 percent from 1999 while the average price of power
sold was 4 percent  lower in 2000.  More sales from  wholesale  power  marketing
activities and higher  requirements by large industrial  retail customers led to
the increase in  megawatthour  sales.  Megawatthour  sales from wholesale  power
marketing  activities  increased 63 percent in 2000 and contributed $4.4 million
more to revenue.  Megawatthour sales to industrial customers increased 5 percent
in 2000 and contributed $1.4 million more to revenue. The average price of power
sold was lower in 2000  primarily  because  of lower  wholesale  prices and $0.8
million less demand revenue from large industrial customers.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 13 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2000 (16 percent in 1999).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in 2000 (6 percent in 1999).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 6
percent of consolidated operating revenue in both 2000 and 1999.

Automotive Services operating revenue was $22.7 million higher in 2000 primarily
due to increased  sales at ADESA  auction  facilities  and financing at AFC loan
production  offices.  At ADESA auction  facilities 295,000 vehicles were sold in
2000  (260,000 in 1999).  Financial  results for 2000  included  three months of
operations for two auction facilities acquired in April and July of 1999 and two
months of operations  for one auction  facility  acquired in February  2000. AFC
financed approximately 195,000 vehicles in 2000 (149,000 in 1999) through its 84
loan production offices.

Water Services operating revenue was $3.6 million higher in 2000 because of a 17
percent increase in water  consumption.  Customer growth, the inclusion of water
systems acquired during 1999 and drier weather conditions led to the increase in
water consumption.

Investments  operating  revenue was $29.2  million  higher in 2000.  Significant
sales by the Company's  real estate  operations  were the primary reason for the
increase.  In 2000 two large sales contributed $17.2 million to revenue.  One of
these sales was real estate  operations'  largest  single  transaction  to date.
Improved  returns  from the  securities  portfolio  and $3.6 million of gains on
intermediate-term  investments in emerging technologies relating to the electric
industry also contributed to higher operating  revenue from Investments in 2000.
The Company's  securities portfolio reported an after-tax return of 3.96 percent
in 2000 (0.06 percent in 1999).

OPERATING EXPENSES

Electric Services  operating expenses were $9.7 million higher in 2000 primarily
due to increased  purchased  power expense.  Purchased  power expense was higher
because of  increased  prices in the  wholesale  market  and more  megawatthours
bought to support additional wholesale power marketing activities and the higher
requirements of industrial customers.

Automotive  Services  operating  expenses  were  $19.2  million  higher  in 2000
primarily  because of increased  sales  activity at the auction  facilities  and
financing activity at the automobile dealer floorplan  financing  business.  The
inclusion of three additional vehicle auctions also increased operating expenses
at the auction facilities in 2000.

Water  Services  operating  expenses were $2.8 million higher in 2000 due to the
inclusion of water systems acquired in 1999.

Investments operating expenses were $11.0 million higher in 2000 due to the cost
of property sold by the Company's real estate operations.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

Income tax  expense was $13 million  higher in 2000  primarily  the result of an
increase in operating income.

OUTLOOK

ELECTRIC  SERVICES.  As the  electric  industry  continues to  restructure,  the
contribution  from  Electric  Services is expected to remain stable with a solid
customer base.  Approximately  half of the  electricity  the Company sells is to
large industrial customers,  primarily taconite producers,  which have long-term
all-requirements contracts. Approximately 80 percent of the ore consumed by
integrated steel facilities in the Great Lakes region originates from five
taconite customers of Minnesota Power.

The domestic steel industry  continues to face high levels of imported products.
In 1999 the United States imported 35,657,000 net tons of steel, higher than any
year except 1998.  That level is also 14.4 percent higher than in 1997, the last
record  year prior to the  unprecedented  import  surge in 1998.  Overall  steel
prices remain somewhat depressed. Despite  the high level of imports, the strong
U.S.  economy is helping  fuel demand for steel produced  domestically.  Through
March 2000, production of U.S. steel mills was up approximately 20 percent over
the same time period in 1999.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES. ADESA is the second largest and the fastest growing vehicle
auction business in North America.  ADESA projects a 10 percent estimated annual
growth in vehicles  sold through  sales at existing and new auction  facilities.
AFC, the largest  independent  automobile dealer floorplan financing business in
North  America,  estimates a 15 to 20 percent  annual growth in  receivables  at
existing  locations.  AFC also plans to grow  through  the  introduction  of new
products  and  services.  The  Company  is unable to  predict  the impact of the
recently  announced  merger between  Manheim  Auctions,  Inc. and ADT Automotive
Holdings, Inc. on AFC's offices located at ADT auctions.

WATER  SERVICES  includes  the largest  investor  owned water  utilities in both
Florida  and  North  Carolina.  The  Company  continues  to  position  itself by
selectively  acquiring  targeted  water systems and  developing a  non-regulated
presence in the contract  maintenance  business.  Both Florida  Water and Heater
operate in states that are currently  experiencing rapid population growth which
should  contribute to annual customer growth of 3 to 5 percent over the next two
years.

INVESTMENTS.  Over the last 5 years, sales by real estate operations have been 3
to 4  times  the  acquisition  cost  of  property  sold,  creating  strong  cash
generation  and  profitability.  The real estate  strategy  is to acquire  large
portfolios of property, add value and resell them at going market prices.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2000
reflected  improved  operating  results and continued  focus on working  capital
management.  Cash from  operating  activities  was also  affected by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 7 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers.  However, ADESA has arrangements to use the
proceeds  from  the sale of  commercial  paper  issued  by the  Company  to meet
short-term  working  capital  requirements  arising  from the  timing of payment
obligations  to vehicle  sellers  and the  availability  of funds  from  vehicle
purchasers.  During the sales  process,  ADESA does not typically  take title to
vehicles.

AFC also has  arrangements  to use proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper
issued  by  the  Company  to  meet  its  operational  requirements.  AFC  offers
short-term  on-site  financing  for dealers to purchase  vehicles at auctions in
exchange for a security  interest in those  vehicles.  The financing is provided
through  the  earlier  of the date the  dealer  sells the  vehicle  or a general
borrowing  term of 30 to 45 days.  AFC sells certain  finance  receivables  on a
revolving  basis to a wholly owned,  unconsolidated,  qualified  special purpose
subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn sells,  on a revolving  basis, an undivided
interest  in  eligible  finance  receivables,  up to a  maximum  at any one time
outstanding of $300 million,  to third party purchasers under an agreement which
expires at the end of 2002.  At March 31,  2000 AFC had sold  $347.3  million of
finance  receivables  to the  special  purpose  subsidiary  ($296.8  million  at
December 31, 1999).  Third party purchasers had purchased an undivided  interest
in finance  receivables  of $247 million

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

from this  subsidiary  at March 31, 2000 ($225  million at December  31,  1999).
Unsold finance  receivables held by the special purpose  subsidiary are recorded
by AFC as residual interest at fair value. Fair value is based upon estimates of
future cash flows, using assumptions that market participants would use to value
such instruments, including estimates of anticipated credit losses over the life
of the  receivables  sold;  a discount  rate was not used due to the  short-term
nature of the  receivables  sold. The fair value of AFC's residual  interest was
$67.0 million at March 31, 2000 ($57.6  million at December 31, 1999).  Proceeds
from the sale of the receivables  were used to repay borrowings from the Company
and fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
March 31, 2000  compared to December  31, 1999 were due to  increased  sales and
financing  activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down
during the winter months and in December  because of the holidays.  As a result,
both ADESA and AFC had lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

In January 2000 ADESA Canada Inc.  acquired an  additional  26 percent of Impact
Auto Auctions Ltd.  bringing the total ownership  percentage to 73 percent.  The
Company  anticipates  acquiring  the  remaining  27  percent by the end of 2000.
Impact Auto  Auctions  Ltd. is a business  that  auctions  salvaged  vehicles at
several locations in Canada.

In February  2000 ADESA  purchased  the Mission  City Auto Auction in San Diego,
California.  The Mission City  auction,  which has been renamed ADESA San Diego,
operates six auction lanes on 30 acres with full reconditioning  facilities. AFC
has opened an office at ADESA San Diego.

The  transactions  described  in the two  preceding  paragraphs  had a  combined
purchase price of $15.7  million.  The Company  funded these  transactions  with
internally generated funds.

In March 2000 ADESA  issued $35  million of 8.10%  Senior  Notes,  Series B, due
March 30, 2010.  Proceeds were used to refinance  short-term  bank  indebtedness
incurred for the acquisition of vehicle auction facilities purchased in 1999 and
for general corporate purposes.

In April 2000 the Company redeemed $10 million, or 100,000 shares, of Redeemable
Serial Preferred Stock A, $7.125 Series.  Proceeds from the Company's securities
portfolio were used to fund this redemption.

In April 2000 leases for three ADESA auction facilities  (Boston,  Charlotte and
Knoxville) were refinanced in a $28.4 million leveraged lease  transaction.  The
new lease  expires  on April 1,  2010,  but may be  terminated  after 2005 under
certain conditions. Minnesota Power has guaranteed ADESA's obligations under the
lease.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the three months
ended March 31, 2000 totaled $30.1 million ($15.3 million in 1999). Expenditures
for 2000  included  $9.7  million  for  Electric  Services,  $15.1  million  for
Automotive  Services and $5.3 million for Water Services.  Internally  generated
funds and the issuance of long-term debt were the primary sources of funding for
these expenditures.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. (SFAS) 133, "Accounting
for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,"  as amended by SFAS 137,
effective for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be
recorded on the balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair
value.  SFAS  133  requires  that  changes  in the  derivative's  fair  value be
recognized  currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are
met. Special  accounting for qualifying  hedges allows a derivative's  gains and
losses to offset the related  results on the hedged item. The Company  currently
believes it has only a limited  amount of  derivative  activity  and adoption of
SFAS 133 is not expected to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial
position and results of operations.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's  securities portfolio has exposure to both price and interest rate
risk.  Investments held principally for near-term sale are classified as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies.  In strategies  designed to hedge
overall  market  risks,  the Company also sells common stock short.  Investments
held for an  indeterminate  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale
securities  and  also  recorded  at fair  value.  Available-for-sale  securities
consisted of 4.7 million shares of ACE Limited and securities in a grantor trust
established to fund certain employee benefits.

ITEM 5.    OTHER INFORMATION

Reference is made to the Company's 1999 Form 10-K for background  information on
the following updates.  Unless otherwise indicated,  cited references are to the
Company's 1999 Form 10-K.

Ref. Page 4. - First and Second Paragraphs

The domestic steel industry  continues to face high levels of imported products.
In 1999 the United States imported 35,657,000 net tons of steel, higher than any
year except 1998.  That level is also 14.4 percent higher than in 1997, the last
record  year prior to the  unprecedented  import  surge in 1998.  Overall  steel
prices remain somewhat depressed.

Despite  the high level of  imports,  the strong  U.S.  economy is helping  fuel
demand for steel produced  domestically.  Through March 2000, production of U.S.
steel mills is up approximately 20 percent over the same time period in 1999.

Ref. Page 7. - Eighth Paragraph

On April 12,  2000 MAPP,  of which  Minnesota  Power is a member,  approved  the
execution  of  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding   (MOU)  with  the  Mid-American
Interconnected  Network  (MAIN) to merge the  reliability  functions  of the two
organizations into a Regional Reliability  Organization (RRO). MAIN approved the
MOU on April 7, 2000. The new RRO will be designed and structured to comply with
statutory  requirements   applicable  to  regional  reliability   organizations.
Definitive  agreements are expected to be completed by July 2000. The goal is to
have the new RRO  operational by November 2000. Both  organizations  provide for
the reliable transmission of electric power in the central United States.

Ref. Page 8. - First Paragraph

The Minnesota  Department of Commerce (DOC) approved the petitions of several of
the  Company's  largest  customers  to  opt-out  of  the  CIP  minimum  spending
requirements.  As a result,  the Company has indicated to the DOC that its 2000
and 2001 minimum spending level of $5.6 million has been reduced to $2.7 million
annually.

On February 18, 2000 the MPUC issued its order regarding the denial of Minnesota
Power's  1998 lost margin  recovery.  Minnesota  Power  timely filed a Notice of
Appeal of the MPUC's  decision  with the  Minnesota  Court of Appeals  (Court of
Appeals).  Northern  States  Power  Company  (NSP) also filed a

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

Notice of Appeal regarding its similar denial of lost margin recovery.  On March
23, 2000 the Court of Appeals issued an order  consolidating the Minnesota Power
and NSP appeals because they raise almost identical legal issues. Initial briefs
will be filed by mid June 2000.  The Company cannot predict the timeframe or the
outcome of the Court of Appeals decision in this matter.

Ref. Page 9. - Fourth Full Paragraph

On April 14, 2000 Minnesota  Power and Great River Energy signed an agreement to
form Split Rock  Energy LLC (Split  Rock).  Split Rock was formed as a result of
the  alliance  between  Minnesota  Power and Great River  Energy.  The  alliance
between the two companies combines power supply  capabilities and customer loads
for power pool operations.  Ownership of existing  generation assets and current
customer supply arrangements will not change for either company. Split Rock will
contract  for  exclusive  services  from MPEX,  the  Company's  power  marketing
division.   Pending  regulatory  approval,  Split  Rock  is  expected  to  begin
operations during the second quarter of 2000.

Split Rock has submitted  filings with the FERC for approval to use market-based
rates and applied for  membership  in the MAPP as a  transmission-using  member.
This  membership  application  was  approved  by MAPP.  Split Rock is  currently
resolving  certain issues raised by several MAPP  operating  committees to allow
Split Rock to combine the load and capability of both Minnesota  Power and Great
River Energy for joint  operating and reporting  purposes.  Minnesota  Power has
also  filed for MPUC approval of all  transactional  agreements  entered  into
with Split Rock. Great River Energy is in the process of receiving approval from
the Rural Utilities Service to assign its native load and power and marketing
obligations to Split Rock.

On January 1, 2000 ADESA Canada Inc. acquired an additional 26 percent of Impact
Auto Auctions Ltd.  bringing the total ownership  percentage to 73 percent.  The
Company  anticipates  acquiring  the  remaining  27  percent by the end of 2000.
Impact Auto  Auctions  Ltd. is a business  that  auctions  salvaged  vehicles at
several locations in Canada.

On February 7, 2000 ADESA  purchased the Mission City Auto Auction in San Diego,
California.  The Mission City  auction,  which has been renamed ADESA San Diego,
operates six auction lanes on 30 acres with full reconditioning facilities. With
the  San  Diego  auction  facility,   ADESA  has  three  auction  facilities  in
California.  ADESA  Sacramento was acquired in 1997 and ADESA Los Angeles opened
in April 2000. AFC has opened an office at ADESA San Diego. California is one of
America's largest car markets.

In April 2000  operations  also  began at ADESA  Concord,  located  in  Concord,
Massachusetts. ADESA now owns and operates 32 vehicle auction facilities.

Ref. Page 12. - Footnotes to Table

In April 2000 leases for three ADESA auction facilities  (Boston,  Charlotte and
Knoxville) were refinanced in a $28.4 million leveraged lease  transaction.  The
new lease is treated as an operating lease for financial  reporting purposes and
expires on April 1, 2010.  The lease may be terminated  after 2005 under certain
conditions. Minnesota Power has guaranteed ADESA's obligations under the lease.

                                                                    Exhibit 4(a)
                                    GUARANTEE
                                       OF
                              MINNESOTA POWER, INC.

                  For value received,  Minnesota Power, Inc., a corporation duly
organized and existing  under the laws of the State of Minnesota  (herein called
the  "Guarantor"),  hereby fully and  unconditionally  guarantees to the Trustee
under the Indenture,  dated as of May 15, 1996,  between ADESA  Corporation (the
"Company")  and The Bank of New York, as Trustee  (together  with any amendments
thereto,  the "Indenture"),  the payment of the obligations of the Company under
the  Securities of the Second Series and the Indenture  relating to such series,
including, without limitation, (i) the due and punctual payment of the principal
of and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of the Second Series when
and as the same  shall  become due and  payable,  whether  at  maturity  or upon
redemption or upon declaration or otherwise,  according to the terms thereof and
of the Indenture, and (ii) the due and punctual payment of any amounts which may
be payable by the  Company  under or  pursuant  to the Tax  Indemnity  Agreement
referred  to  in  paragraph  16 of  the  Officer's  Certificate  of  William  T.
Stackhouse,  Chief  Financial  Officer of the Company  dated March 30, 2000 (the
"Tax Indemnity  Payments").  In case of the failure of the Company punctually to
pay any such principal,  premium,  if any, or interest or Tax Indemnity Payment,
the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made punctually when
and as the same  shall  become due and  payable,  whether  at  maturity  or upon
redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by
the Company. The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be
full and unconditional, irrespective of the validity, legality or enforceability
of the  Securities  of the Second  Series or the  Indenture,  the absence of any
action  to  enforce  the  same,  the  waiver  or  consent  by the  Holder of the
Securities of the Second Series or by the Trustee with respect to any provisions
thereof or of said Indenture,  the recovery of any judgment  against the Company
or any  action  to  enforce  the  same or any  other  circumstance  which  might
otherwise  constitute a legal or equitable  discharge or defense of a guarantor.
The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of
claims with a court in the event of merger or  bankruptcy  of the  Company,  any
right to require a proceeding first against the Company,  protest or notice with
respect to the  Securities  of the Second Series or the  indebtedness  evidenced
thereby, and all demands whatsoever,  and covenants that this Guarantee will not
be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the
Securities of the Second Series and in this Guarantee.

                  The Guarantor  hereby  guarantees  that the obligations of the
Company  under the  Securities  of the Second  Series and the  Indenture  to the
extent  related to such series will be paid to the  Trustee  without  set-off or
counterclaim or other reduction  whatsoever  (whether for taxes,  withholding or
otherwise) in lawful currency of the United States of America.

                  The obligations of the Guarantor  hereunder are independent of
the obligations of the Company under the Securities of the Second Series and the
Indenture to the extent related to such series, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted  against the Guarantor whether or not an action or
proceeding  is brought  against  the  Company  and whether or not the Company is
joined  in any  such  action  or  proceeding.  The  liability  of the  Guarantor
hereunder  is full and  unconditional  and (to the extent  permitted by law) the
liability  and  obligations  of the Guarantor  hereunder  shall not be released,
discharged,  mitigated,  waived, impaired or affected in whole or in part by any
circumstance  (including any statute of  limitations)  (other than payment) that
might  constitute  a defense  available  to, or  discharge of the Company or the
Guarantor,   including,   without   limitation,   any  termination,   amendment,
modification, addition, deletion, supplement or other change to any of the terms
of the Securities of the Second Series or the Indenture, any failure on the part
of the Trustee or any Holder to enforce,  assert or exercise any right, power or
remedy,  any  waiver,  consent,  extension,  renewal,  indulgence,   compromise,
release,  settlement,  refunding or other action or inaction under or in respect
of any obligation or liability

<PAGE>

of  the  Company  or  the  Guarantor  or  the  Trustee  or  any  Holder,  or any
modification,  compromise, settlement or release by the Trustee, or by operation
of law or otherwise,  of the  obligations  or the liability of the Company under
the Securities of the Second Series, in whole or in part.

                  The  Guarantor  agrees  that if at any time all or any part of
any payment at any time received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities
of the Second  Series is or must be rescinded or returned by the Trustee or such
Holders  for  any  reason  whatsoever   (including,   without  limitation,   the
insolvency,  reorganization or bankruptcy of the Company),  then the Guarantor's
obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned,
be deemed to have continued in existence  notwithstanding  such previous receipt
by the Trustee or such Holders, and the Guarantor's  obligations hereunder shall
continue to be effective or  reinstated,  as the case may be, as if such payment
had never been made.

                  The  failure of the  Trustee  to  enforce  any right or remedy
hereunder,  or promptly to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to
enforce any such right or remedy,  shall not  constitute a waiver  thereof,  nor
give rise to any estoppel against the Trustee, nor excuse the Guarantor from its
obligations hereunder.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Guarantee  or of the  Indenture  shall  alter or  impair  the  guarantee  of the
Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional,  of the due and punctual payment
of the  principal  of and  premium,  if any, and interest on the Security of the
series upon which this Guarantee is endorsed and of any Tax Indemnity Payments.

                  The Guarantor  shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder
of the  Securities  of the Second  Series  against the Company in respect of any
amounts paid by the Guarantor  pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee upon
payment by the Guarantor of all amounts due and payable under such Guarantee.

                  This  Guarantee  shall be  irrevocable  unless  terminated  as
provided  herein.  This Guarantee shall be terminated upon the assumption by the
Guarantor of the  obligations  of the Company under the Securities of the Second
Series and the Indenture to the extent related to such series as provided in the
terms of such Securities.

                  All  capitalized  terms used in this  Guarantee  which are not
defined  herein but are defined in the  Indenture  shall have the  meanings  set
forth in the Indenture.

                  This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made under the
laws of the State of New York and  shall for all  purposes  be  governed  by and
construed in accordance with the laws of such State.

SECTION 1.  CONSOLIDATION, MERGER AND SALE OF ASSETS.

                  During the term of this  Guarantee,  the  Guarantor  shall not
consolidate  with or merge into any other  corporation,  or convey or  otherwise
transfer or lease its properties and assets  substantially as an entirety to any
Person, unless

               (a) the corporation  formed by such  consolidation  or into which
      the  Guarantor is merged or the Person  which  acquires by  conveyance  or
      transfer,  or which  leases,  the  properties  and assets of the Guarantor
      substantially  as an  entirety  shall be a Person  organized  and  validly
      existing  under the laws of the United  States,  any State  thereof or the
      District of Columbia,  and shall expressly assume,  the obligations of the
      Guarantor under this Guarantee;

                                       2
<PAGE>

               (b) immediately  after giving effect to such transaction no Event
      of Default,  and no event  which,  after  notice or lapse of time or both,
      would become an Event of Default,  shall have occurred and be  continuing;
      and

               (c)  the  Guarantor  shall  have  delivered  to  the  Trustee  an
      Officer's  Certificate (as hereinafter  defined) and an Opinion of Counsel
      (as hereinafter  defined),  each stating that such consolidation,  merger,
      conveyance,  or other  transfer or lease and such  supplemental  indenture
      comply  with  this  Guarantee  and that all  conditions  precedent  herein
      provided for relating to such transactions have been complied with.

               Upon any  consolidation  by the  Guarantor  with or merger by the
Guarantor  into any other  corporation or any  conveyance,  or other transfer or
lease of the properties and assets of the Guarantor substantially as an entirety
in  accordance  with this  Section,  the  successor  corporation  formed by such
consolidation  or into which the Guarantor is merged or the Person to which such
conveyance,  transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for,
and may exercise  every right and power of, the Guarantor  under this  Guarantee
and under the terms of the Securities of the Second Series (including assumption
of the  obligations  under the  Securities  of the  Second  Series and under the
Indenture to the extent  related to such series) with the same effect as if such
successor Person had been named as the Guarantor herein, and thereafter,  except
in the  case of a  lease,  the  predecessor  Person  shall  be  relieved  of all
obligations and covenants under this Guarantee.

SECTION 1A.       FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

         During the term of this  Guarantee,  the Guarantor shall deliver to the
holders of the Securities of the Second Series:

requirements  therefor  and which are filed  with the  Securities  and  Exchange

               (hereinafter  called "Secured  Obligations")  (a) in an aggregate

               Securities  of the Second Series then  Outstanding,  (b) maturing
               (or being subject to mandatory  redemption) on March 30, 2010 and

               provision for mandatory  redemption  upon an  acceleration of the
               maturity  of all  Outstanding  Securities  of the  Second  Series
               following an Event of Default  (such  mandatory  redemption to be
               rescinded  upon the  rescission of such  acceleration);  it being
               expressly  understood that such Secured  Obligations (x) may, but
               need  not,  bear  interest,   (y)  may,  but  need  not,  contain
               provisions  for  the  redemption  thereof  at the  option  of the
               issuer,  any such redemption to be made at a redemption  price or
               prices not less than the principal  amount  thereof and (z) shall
               be held by the  Trustee  for the  benefit  of the  Holders of all
               Securities  of the Second  Series  from time to time  Outstanding
               subject to such terms and conditions relating to surrender to the
               Guarantor, transfer restrictions, voting, application of payments
               of principal and interest and other matters as shall be set forth
               in an indenture  supplemental hereto  specifically  providing for
               the delivery to the Trustee of such Secured Obligations.

               C. If the Guarantor shall elect either of the alternatives
described in subsection B, the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee:

                       1. an  amendment  to this  Guarantee  (a)  together  with
               appropriate inter-creditor  arrangements,  whereby this Guarantee
               shall be secured by the Lien  referred to in subsection B equally
               and ratably with all other  indebtedness  secured by such Lien or
               (b)  providing  for  the  delivery  to  the  Trustee  of  Secured
               Obligations;

                       2. an  Officer's  Certificate  (a) stating  that,  to the
               knowledge of the signer, (I) no Event of Default has occurred and
               is  continuing  and (II) no event has occurred and is  continuing

               construction  of  property  to be used by the  Guarantor,  to the
               extent that such Lien is required in connection with the issuance

               (now The Bank of New  York)  and  Richard  H.  West  (Douglas  I.
               MacInnes,  successor),  as Trustees,  as heretofore and hereafter
               supplemented and amended (the  "Mortgage");  and Liens created by
               any other indenture  hereafter executed by the Guarantor pursuant
               to  which  bonds  issued  under  the  Mortgage  are  or are to be
               delivered to the  trustee(s)  under such indenture in a principal
               amount at least equal to the principal  amount of debt securities
               to be secured by such indenture; and

                       (x) in addition to the Permitted Liens defined in clauses

               borrowed money (under  circumstances not otherwise  excepted from
               the operation of this Section) in an aggregate  principal  amount
               not  exceeding  2.5% of the total assets of the Guarantor and its

instructions  to give such notice shall have been given to such trustee or other
holder.  As used  herein,  the term  "Investment  Securities"  means  any of the

amended,  or any successor  section of such Code or successor  federal  statute,
provided that the portfolio of such investment company is limited to obligations
or securities of the character and investment  quality  contemplated  in clauses
(a) through (f) above and repurchase  agreements which are fully  collateralized
by any of such  obligations  or  securities;  and (i) any other  obligations  or
securities  which may  lawfully be  purchased  by the Trustee in its capacity as
such.

                       "PURCHASE MONEY LIEN" means, with respect to any property
being acquired by the Guarantor, a Lien on such property which

                       (a) is taken or retained by the transferor of such
               property to secure all or part of the purchase price thereof;

                       (b) is  granted  to one or more  Persons  other  than the
               transferor  which, by making advances or incurring an obligation,
               give value to enable the  grantor of such Lien to acquire  rights
               in or the use of such property;

                       (c) is held by a trustee or agent for the  benefit of one
               or more Persons  described  in clause (a) or (b) above,  provided
               that such Lien may be held,  in addition,  for the benefit of one
               or more other Persons which shall have theretofore  given, or may
               thereafter  give,  value to or for the  benefit or account of the
               grantor of such Lien for one or more other purposes; or

                       (d) otherwise constitutes a purchase money mortgage or a
               purchase money security interest under applicable law;

and,  without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  for purposes of this
Guarantee,  the term  Purchase  Money Lien  shall be deemed to include  any Lien
described  above whether or not such Lien (x) shall permit the issuance or other
incurrence of additional indebtedness secured by such Lien on such property, (y)
shall permit the subjection to such Lien of additional property and the issuance
or other  incurrence of additional  indebtedness on the basis thereof and/or (z)
shall have been granted prior to the acquisition of such property,  shall attach
to or otherwise  cover property  other than the property  being acquired  and/or
shall secure  obligations  issued prior and/or subsequent to the issuance of the
obligations delivered in connection with such acquisition.

                                ADESA CORPORATION

                           OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE 2-D-2

         William T.  Stackhouse,  Chief Financial  Officer of ADESA  Corporation
(the "Company"),  pursuant to the authority  granted in the Board Resolutions of
the  Company  dated  as of  March  10,  2000,  and  Sections  201 and 301 of the
Indenture  defined herein,  in his capacity as such, does hereby certify for and
on behalf of the  Company  to The Bank of New York (the  "Trustee"),  as Trustee
under the Indenture of the Company (For Unsecured Debt  Securities)  dated as of
May 15, 1996 (as supplemented, the "Indenture"), that:

1.       The  Securities  of the second  series to be issued under the Indenture
         shall be  designated  "8.10%  Senior  Notes,  Series B, Due 2010"  (the
         "Securities of the Second  Series").  The term  "Guarantor"  shall mean
         Minnesota Power, Inc., its successors and assigns. The term "Guarantee"
         shall  mean  the  Guarantee  described  in  paragraph  13  hereof.  All
         capitalized terms used in this certificate which are not defined herein
         but are defined in the  Indenture  shall have the meanings set forth in
         the Indenture;

2.       The Securities of the Second Series shall be limited in aggregate
         principal  amount to  $35,000,000  at any time  Outstanding,  except as
         contemplated in Section 301(b) of the Indenture;

3.       The Securities of the Second Series shall mature and the principal
         shall be due and payable  together with all accrued and unpaid interest
         thereon on March 30, 2010;

4.       The  Securities  of the Second  Series shall bear  interest  from,  and
         including,  March 30,  2000,  at the rate of 8.10%  per  annum  payable
         semi-annually  on March 30 and  September  30 of each  year  (each,  an
         "Interest Payment Date") commencing  September 30, 2000;  PROVIDED that
         such rate of  interest  shall be 10.10% per annum  with  respect to any
         days during which an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of
         the Second Series shall exist and be continuing. The amount of interest
         payable  for any such period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
         year of twelve  30-day  months and for any period  shorter  than a full
         month,  on the  basis of the  actual  number  of days  elapsed  in such
         period.  Interest on the  Securities  of the Second  Series will accrue
         from, and including,  the date of original  issuance and will accrue to
         the first Interest  Payment Date, and thereafter  will accrue from, and
         including,  the last Interest  Payment Date to which  interest has been
         paid or duly provided for. In the event that any Interest  Payment Date
         is not a Business  Day,  then payment of interest  payable on such date
         will be made on the next  succeeding  day which is a Business  Day (and
         without any interest or other  payment in respect of such delay),  with
         the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date;

5.       Each installment of interest on a Security of the Second Series shall
         be payable to the Person in whose name such  Security is  registered at
         the  close of  business  on the date  fifteen  (15)  days  prior to the
         relevant  Interest  Payment Date (the "Regular Record Date") or if such
         date is not a Business  Day,  the next  succeeding  Business  Day.  The
         Company  shall  not be  required  to  execute  or to  provide  for  the
         registration  of  transfer of or the  exchange  of any  Security of the
         Second  Series  during a period of 15 days next  preceding any Interest
         Payment  Date for such  Series.  Any  installment  of  interest  on the
         Securities  of the Second Series not  punctually  paid or duly provided
         for  shall  forthwith  cease  to be  payable  to the  Holders  of  such
         Securities of the Second Series on such Regular  Record Date and may be
         paid to the Persons in whose name the  Securities  of the

<PAGE>

         Second  Series are  registered  at the close of  business  on a Special
         Record  Date  to be  fixed  by the  Trustee  for  the  payment  of such
         Defaulted  Interest.  Notice of such  Defaulted  Interest  and  Special
         Record  Date  shall be given to the  Holders of the  Securities  of the
         Second Series not less than 10 days prior to such Special  Record Date,
         or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not  inconsistent
         with  the  requirements  of  any  securities   exchange  on  which  the
         Securities of the Second Series may be listed,  and upon such notice as
         may be required  by such  exchange,  all as more fully  provided in the
         Indenture;

6.       The principal, premium, if any, and each installment of interest on the
         Securities of the Second Series shall be payable as provided in Exhibit
         A.  Registration and registration of transfers and exchanges in respect
         of the Securities of the Second Series may be effected at the office or
         agency of the  Company in The City of New York.  Notices and demands to
         or upon the Company in respect of the  Securities  of the Second Series
         may be served at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New
         York.  The Corporate  Trust Office of the Trustee will initially be the
         agency of the Company for such service of notices and demands,  and the
         Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes;
         provided,  however,  that the Company reserves the right to change,  by
         one or more  Officer's  Certificates,  any such  office or agency.  The
         Company will  initially be the Security  Registrar and the Paying Agent
         for the Securities of the Second Series;

7.       The Securities of the Second Series will be redeemable as provided in
         the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto,  upon not less than 30 nor more
         than 60 days'  notice  given  to the  Holders  thereof.  In case of any
         redemption  at the election of the Company of all of the  Securities of
         the Second  Series,  the Company  shall,  at least 45 days prior to the
         Redemption  Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be
         satisfactory  to the  Trustee),  notify the  Trustee in writing of such
         Redemption  Date.  In case of any  redemption  at the  election  of the
         Company of less than all the  Securities  of such  series,  the Company
         shall,  at least  45 days  prior to the  Redemption  Date  fixed by the
         Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee),
         notify  the  Trustee  in  writing  of such  Redemption  Date and of the
         principal  amount  of  Securities  of such  series to be  redeemed  and
         deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that no default
         in  payment  of  interest  or  Event of  Default  with  respect  to the
         Securities of such series has occurred (or, if such an Event of Default
         shall have occurred,  that the same has been cured or waived).  In case
         of any partial  redemption of the Securities of the Second Series,  the
         principal  amount  to be  redeemed  shall  be  prorated  as  nearly  as
         practicable  among the  Holders of the  Outstanding  Securities  of the
         Second Series  except that the portion of the principal  amount of each
         Outstanding  Security of the Second Series to be redeemed  shall always
         be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof;

8.       Each Security of the Second Series shall bear the non-registration
         legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto,  unless
         otherwise  agreed by the  Company,  such  agreement  to be confirmed in
         writing to the Trustee. Nothing in the Indenture, the Securities of the
         Second  Series or this  certificate  shall be  construed to require the
         Company to  register  any  Securities  of the Second  Series  under the
         Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  (the  "Securities  Act")  unless
         otherwise expressly agreed by the Company,  confirmed in writing to the
         Trustee,  or to make any  transfer of such  Securities  in violation of
         applicable  law. In  connection  with any transfer of Securities of the
         Second Series,  the transferring  Holders and their  transferees  shall
         provide the Company and the Trustee  with such  certificates  and other
         information  as the  Company  or the  Trustee  may  reasonably  request
         regarding the  compliance of such transfer with the  Securities Act and
         any applicable  state securities laws or any exemption  therefrom,  the
         validity,  legality and due  authorization  of any such  transfer,  the
         eligibility  of the  transferee  to receive such Security and any other
         facts and circumstances related to such transfer;  and the Trustee, the
         Security  Registrar  and

                                       2

<PAGE>

         the Company  shall be under no duty to inquire into,  may  conclusively
         presume the  correctness  of, and shall be fully  protected  in relying
         upon such opinions,  certificates and other  information  received from
         the Holders and any transferees of any Securities of the Second Series;

9.       No service  charge  shall be made for the  registration  of transfer or
         exchange of the  Securities of the Second  Series;  provided,  however,
         that the Company may require  payment of a sum  sufficient to cover any
         tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with
         the exchange or transfer;

10.      The Company additionally covenants that, so long as any Securities of
         the Second Series remain Outstanding, it will:

         A.       keep proper books of record and account in accordance with
                  generally accepted accounting principles;

         B.       pay all applicable taxes, assessments and governmental charges
                  imposed  upon  it or any of its  properties  or  assets  or in
                  respect of any of its  franchises,  business income or profits
                  and  comply  with all  applicable  statutes,  regulations  and
                  orders of governmental bodies relating to taxes except for any
                  tax the payment of which, or statutes,  regulations and orders
                  the compliance with which, in each case, is being contested in
                  good  faith and by  appropriate  means and for which  adequate
                  reserves  have been  provided  or with  respect to which there
                  would not  reasonably  be  expected  to be a material  adverse
                  effect on the financial condition of the Company;

         C.       carry and  maintain in full force and effect at all times with
                  fiscally sound and reputable  insurers  insurance against such
                  risks as the  Company  deems  reasonable  and  prudent  in the
                  circumstances;   provided   that  such   insurance   shall  be
                  comparable  to insurance  carried by, or otherwise  maintained
                  by,  comparable  companies  similarly  situated to the Company
                  carrying on the same types of businesses;

         D.       comply with the requirements of all applicable laws, rules,
                  regulations  and  orders of any  governmental  authority,  the
                  noncompliance with which would materially adversely affect the
                  business,  condition (financial or other), assets,  properties
                  or operations of the Company taken as a whole; and

         E.       give prompt written notice to the Holders of its acceptance of
                  the  appointment  by the Trustee of any  Authenticating  Agent
                  (such   notice  to  include  the  name  and  address  of  such
                  Authenticating  Agent) as  contemplated  by Section 915 of the
                  Indenture.

11.      So long as any Securities of the Second Series remain Outstanding,  the
         following shall constitute additional Events of Default with respect to
         such series:

         (a)      At any time prior to the payment in full of all amounts due
                  under the Securities of the Second  Series,  the Company shall
                  (A)  fail  to  pay  aggregate   Indebtedness  (as  hereinafter
                  defined)  in excess of the greater of (i) $15 million and (ii)
                  5%  of  the  total  assets  of  the  Company  (whether  as  to
                  principal,  interest or  premium)  when due, or (B) breach any
                  covenant with respect to aggregate  Indebtedness  in excess of
                  the greater of (i) $15 million and (ii) 5% of the total assets
                  of the Company (whether as to principal, interest or premium),
                  and such failure or breach  shall  continue  after  applicable
                  grace  periods   specified  in  the  agreement  or  instrument
                  relating to such  Indebtedness,  if the effect of such failure
                  or breach is to accelerate the maturity of such  Indebtedness,
                  and, in such

                                       3
<PAGE>

                  case,  the  Company  shall  have  failed to cure (or  obtain a
                  waiver of) such  failure,  breach or  default  within ten days
                  after the expiration of such grace period has occurred;

         (b)      At any time prior to the  payment in full of all  amounts  due
                  under the Securities of the Second Series, the Guarantor shall
                  fail to pay  aggregate  Indebtedness  in excess of $25 million
                  (whether as to  principal,  interest or premium) when due, and
                  such failure shall  continue  after  applicable  grace periods
                  specified  in the  agreement  or  instrument  relating to such
                  Indebtedness,  if the effect of such failure is to  accelerate
                  the  maturity of such  Indebtedness,  and,  in such case,  the
                  Guarantor  shall  have  failed to cure (or obtain a waiver of)
                  such failure or default with ten days after the  expiration of
                  such grace period has occurred;

                  INDEBTEDNESS,  as used in this  certificate,  shall mean, with
                  respect  to a  Person  (as  defined  in  the  Indenture),  all
                  obligations  (other  than  non-recourse  obligations)  of,  or
                  guaranteed  or assumed by, such Person for  borrowed  money or
                  obligations  under  leases  of  personal  property  which  are
                  required by  generally  accepted  accounting  practices  to be
                  capitalized on the balance sheet of such Person.

         (c)      The entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of

                  (i)      a decree  or  order  for  relief  in  respect  of the
                           Guarantor in an involuntary  case or proceeding under
                           any   applicable   Federal   or   state   bankruptcy,
                           insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or

                  (ii)     a decree or order  adjudging the Guarantor a bankrupt
                           or  insolvent,  or  approving  as  properly  filed  a
                           petition  by one  or  more  persons  other  than  the
                           Guarantor   seeking   reorganization,    arrangement,
                           adjustment  or  composition  of or in  respect of the
                           Guarantor  under  any  applicable  Federal  or  state
                           bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization  or  other
                           similar law, or  appointing  a  custodian,  receiver,
                           liquidator,  assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other
                           similar   official  for  the  Guarantor  or  for  any
                           substantial  part of its  property,  or ordering  the
                           winding up or  liquidation  of its  affairs,  and any
                           such  decree  or order for  relief or any such  other
                           decree or order shall have  remained  unstayed and in
                           effect for a period of 90 consecutive days.

         (d)      The commencement by the Guarantor of a voluntary case or
                  proceeding under any applicable  Federal or state  bankruptcy,
                  insolvency,  reorganization  or  other  similar  law or of any
                  other case or  proceeding  to be  adjudicated  a  bankrupt  or
                  insolvent,  or the  consent  by it to the entry of a decree or
                  order for  relief in  respect  of the  Guarantor  in a case or
                  other  similar  proceeding  or  to  the  commencement  of  any
                  bankruptcy or insolvency  case or proceeding  against it under
                  any  applicable  Federal or state law or the filing by it of a

                  under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy,  insolvency,
                  reorganization  or other  similar law, or the consent by it to
                  the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking
                  possession  by a custodian,  receiver,  liquidator,  assignee,
                  trustee,  sequestrator or similar official of the Guarantor or
                  of any substantial  part of its property,  or the making by it
                  of  an  assignment  for  the  benefit  of  creditors,  or  the
                  admission  by it in writing of its  inability to pay its debts
                  as they become due, or the authorization of such action by the
                  Guarantor's board of directors;

                                       4

         (e)      Failure to perform or breach of any covenant or warranty of
                  the  Guarantor in the  Guarantee for a period of 60 days after
                  there has been given,  by registered or certified mail, to the
                  Guarantor by the Trustee,  or to the Guarantor and the Trustee
                  by the  Holders  of at least  25% in  principal  amount of the
                  Outstanding  Securities of the Second Series, a written notice
                  specifying  such  default  or breach  and  requiring  it to be
                  remedied  and  stating  that  such  notice  is  a  "Notice  of
                  Guarantor  Default"  hereunder,  unless  the  Trustee,  or the
                  Trustee and the Holders of a principal amount of Securities of
                  the  Second  Series  not less  than the  principal  amount  of
                  Securities the Holders of which gave such notice,  as the case
                  may be,  shall agree in writing to an extension of such period
                  prior to its expiration;  provided, however, that the Trustee,
                  or the  Trustee and the  Holders of such  principal  amount of
                  Securities of the Second Series,  as the case may be, shall be
                  deemed  to have  agreed  to an  extension  of such  period  if
                  corrective  action is initiated by the  Guarantor  within such
                  period and is being diligently  pursued.  On any date that the
                  principal  financial officer,  the principal executive officer
                  or the principal  accounting  officer of the  Guarantor  shall
                  obtain  actual  knowledge  that the  Guarantor  has  failed to
                  perform or breached any covenant or warranty of the  Guarantor
                  in the  Guarantee  (and  without  limiting  the  rights of the
                  Trustee  or  the  Holders  if an  actual,  written  Notice  of
                  Guarantor  Default shall have been  delivered),  the Guarantor
                  shall  be  deemed  to have  received  on such  date a  written
                  "Notice  of  Guarantor  Default"  specifying  such  failure or
                  breach and requiring it to be remedied and,  accordingly,  the
                  aforementioned 60 day period shall commence as of such date of
                  actual knowledge.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Securities of
         the Second Series,  this certificate or in the Indenture,  with respect
         to an event  described  in clause (b),  (c), (d) or (e) of this section
         (each such event, a "Guarantor Event"),  such Guarantor Event shall not
         be deemed to be an Event of Default  until 15 Business  Days after such
         Guarantor Event has occurred,  and, if, within such 15 day period,  the
         Company shall have provided to the Trustee a certificate or letter from
         Standard & Poor's  Corporation  (if the Securities of the Second Series
         are then rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation,  or, if the Securities
         of the Second  Series are then rated by another  nationally  recognized
         rating agency, then by such other agency) confirming that the rating on
         the  Securities  of the Second Series at such time is BBB or better (or
         the equivalent rating if by another rating agency), then such Guarantor
         Event shall be deemed to be waived by the Holders of the  Securities of
         the  Second  Series  and  shall  not  constitute  an Event  of  Default
         notwithstanding its continuation in fact;

12.      The Company covenants that the Securities of the Second Series shall
         rank  PARI  PASSU  with  all  existing  and  future   unsecured  Senior
         Indebtedness of the Company;

         For the  purposes  of this  covenant,  except  as  otherwise  expressly
         provided or unless the context otherwise requires:

         SENIOR  INDEBTEDNESS  means all  obligations  (other than  non-recourse
         obligations)  of, or guaranteed or assumed by, the Company for borrowed
         money,  including indebtedness for borrowed money or for the payment of
         money relating to any lease which is  capitalized  on the  consolidated
         balance sheet of the Company and its  subsidiaries  in accordance  with
         generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as in effect  from time to
         time,  or  evidenced  by  bonds,  debentures,  notes or  other  similar
         instruments,  and  in  each  case,  amendments,  renewals,  extensions,
         modifications  and refundings of any such  indebtedness or obligations,
         whether  existing  as of the  date of this  Indenture  or  subsequently
         incurred by the Company;

                                       5

13.      The obligations of the Company to make due and punctual payment of the
         principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of the
         Second  Series  shall be fully and  unconditionally  guaranteed  by the
         Guarantor,  as  provided  in  the  Guarantee  to be  delivered  by  the
         Guarantor to the Trustee. The form of such Guarantee is attached hereto
         as Exhibit B. The Trustee shall hold and enforce such Guarantee  solely
         for the benefit of the Holders of the  Securities of the Second Series.
         If any amounts shall become due and payable under such  Guarantee,  the
         Trustee,  in its own name and as trustee for such  Holders,  may demand
         payment,  may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the
         sums so due and unpaid,  may prosecute  such  proceeding to judgment or
         final  decree and may enforce the same and collect the moneys  adjudged
         or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law;

14.      The  obligations  of the  Company  under the  Securities  of the Second
         Series and under the  Indenture  to the extent  related to such  series
         will be subject to  assumption  in whole by the  Guarantor  at any time
         (and upon such  assumption the Company shall be released and discharged
         from its  obligations  under the  Securities  of the Second  Series and
         under the  Indenture to the extent  related to such series) as provided
         in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto.  Upon such  assumption,  the
         additional Events of Default contained in clauses (a), (c), (d) and (e)
         and the last  paragraph  of  Section  11 of this  certificate  shall be
         deleted and the following  modifications to the Indenture shall be made
         by  supplemental  indenture,  to  remain  in  effect  so  long  as  any
         Securities of the Second Series remain Outstanding:

         A.       The  provisions  contained in the Guarantee  under the heading
                  "Limitation  of  Liens"  shall be added to the  Indenture.  In
                  making such addition,  the word "Company" shall be substituted
                  for the  word  "Guarantor",  the  word  "Indenture"  shall  be
                  substituted   for  the  word   "Guarantee"   and  such   other
                  modifications as the context may require shall be made.

         B.       The additional Event of Default contained in clause (b) of
                  Section  11  of  this  certificate   shall  be  added  to  the
                  Indenture.  In making such addition,  the word "Company" shall
                  be substituted for the word "Guarantor".

15.      The Holders of the Securities of the Second Series, by their acceptance
         of  Securities  of the  Second  Series,  agree  that  the sale or other
         transfer  by the  Company  of the  Company's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,
         Automotive  Finance  Corporation,   does  not  constitute  the  Company
         "conveying  or otherwise  transferring  or leasing its  properties  and
         assets substantially as an entirety" within the meaning of Section 1101
         of the  Indenture.  Nothing  contained  in this  paragraph  15 shall be
         construed  in any way to imply that the sale or other  transfer  by the
         Company of the Company's  subsidiary,  Automotive Finance  Corporation,
         does  constitute the Company  "conveying or otherwise  transferring  or
         leasing its properties and assets  substantially as an entirety" within
         the meaning of Section 1101 of the Indenture;

                                       6

16.      If the Company shall make any deposit of money and/or Government
         Obligations with respect to any Securities of the Second Series, or any
         portion of the principal amount thereof, as contemplated by Section 701
         of the  Indenture  (a  "Deposit"),  the Company may also deliver to the
         Trustee  an  instrument  wherein  the  Company,   notwithstanding   the
         satisfaction  and  discharge  of its  indebtedness  in  respect of such
         Securities  of the Second  Series,  or such  portion  of the  principal
         amount thereof,  shall assume the obligation  (which shall be absolute,
         unconditional and guaranteed to the same extent as were the obligations
         of  the  Company  under  the   Securities  of  the  Second  Series)  to
         irrevocably  deposit with the Trustee or Paying  Agent such  additional
         sums of money, if any, or additional  Government  Obligations  (meeting
         the  requirements of Section 701), if any, or any combination  thereof,
         at such time or times,  as shall be necessary,  together with the money
         and/or Government Obligations theretofore so deposited, to pay when due
         the  principal of and  premium,  if any, and interest due and to become
         due on such Securities of the Second Series or portions thereof, all in
         accordance  with and subject to the  provisions  of said  Section  701;
         provided,  however,  that such instrument may state that the obligation
         of the  Company  to make  additional  deposits  as  aforesaid  shall be
         subject  to the  delivery  to the  Company  by the  Trustee of a notice
         asserting the  deficiency  accompanied  by an opinion of an independent
         public accountant of nationally  recognized  standing,  selected by the
         Trustee, showing the calculation thereof.

         If the Company  proposes to make any  Deposit,  the Company  shall also
                  deliver to the Trustee either:

         (A)      a tax indemnity agreement of the Company (a "Tax Indemnity
                  Agreement"),   reasonably  satisfactory  in  form,  scope  and
                  substance to the Trustee,  which Tax Indemnity Agreement shall
                  include,  inter  alia  (a) the  agreement  of the  Company  to
                  indemnify  any Holder of the  Securities  of the Second Series
                  ("Indemnitee") from any United States federal,  state or local
                  income  tax  liability   (including  penalties  and  interest)
                  resulting  from a Deposit as  contemplated  by Section 7.01 of
                  the Indenture (any such United States federal,  state or local
                  tax  liability   (including   penalties  and  interest)  being
                  referred to as a "Tax  Loss,")  together  with any  reasonable
                  costs and  expenses  incurred by such  Indemnitee  (including,
                  without  limitation,  reasonable  legal fees and  expenses) in
                  connection  with such Tax Loss; and (b)  provisions  such that
                  calculation  of any  Tax  Loss  is net  of  any  tax  benefits
                  associated with such Tax Loss in the current or any future tax
                  years (whether such tax benefit shall be by deduction, credit,
                  allocation,  step-up in basis or otherwise) or refunds to such
                  Indemnitee;  any calculations made pursuant to this (a) or (b)
                  to be made on a so-called "grossed-up" after-tax basis; or

         (B)      an Opinion of Thelen Reid & Priest  LLP,  or other  nationally
                  recognized  independent  counsel,  reasonably  satisfactory in
                  form, scope and substance to the Trustee,  that the Holders of
                  such  Securities  of the Second  Series,  or  portions  of the
                  principal amount thereof,  will not recognize income,  gain or
                  loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result
                  of the Deposit,  the Deposit will not cause the Securities (or
                  any  deemed  exchanged  securities)  to  have  original  issue
                  discount as defined in the  Internal  Revenue Code or Treasury

succeeding  day which is a  Business  Day (and  without  any  interest  or other
payment in respect of such delay),  with the same force and effect as if made on
the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable,  and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest  Payment Date will, as provided in the  Indenture,

interest not so punctually  paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be
payable to the Holder on such Regular  Record Date and may either be paid to the
Person in whose name this Security (or one or more  Predecessor  Securities)  is
registered at the close of business on a Special  Record Date for the payment of

payment  by wire  transfer  is not  required  by such Note  Purchase  Agreement,
payment of principal,  and premium,  if any, and each installment of interest on
this  Security  shall be made at the office or agency of the Company  maintained

                          [FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY]

                  This Security is one of a duly authorized  issue of securities
of the Company (herein called the "Securities"),  issued and to be issued in one
or more series under an Indenture,  dated as of May 15, 1996  (herein,  together
with any amendments thereto,  called the "Indenture",  which term shall have the
meaning assigned to it in such instrument),  between the Company and The Bank of
New York,  as Trustee  (herein  called the  "Trustee",  which term  includes any
successor  trustee  under the  Indenture),  and  reference is hereby made to the
Indenture,  including the Board Resolutions and Officer's Certificate filed with
the Trustee on March 30, 2000 creating the series designated on the face hereof,
for a statement of the  respective  rights,  limitations  of rights,  duties and
immunities  thereunder  of the  Company,  the  Trustee  and the  Holders  of the
Securities  and of the terms  upon  which  the  Securities  are,  and are to be,
authenticated  and delivered.  This Security is one of the series  designated on
the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $35,000,000.

         The  Securities of this series are subject to redemption  upon not less
than 30 days nor more  than 60  days'  notice  by  mail,  at the  option  of the
Company,  in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time (but, if in part,
only in connection with redemptions of Securities of this series in an aggregate
principal  amount  of  $1,000  or any  integral  multiple  thereof),  at a price
("Redemption  Price")  equal  to the  sum of (A)  the  principal  amount  of the
Securities  of this series to be  redeemed,  plus (B) accrued  interest  thereon
(except if the  Redemption  Date shall be an Interest  Payment Date) to the date
selected for  redemption  ("Redemption  Date"),  plus (C) a premium equal to the
Make-Whole  Amount (as  hereinafter  defined).  Each Security of this series (or
portion thereof) so redeemed shall be canceled (or such portion thereof shall be
deemed to have been canceled) and, thereafter, shall not be reissued.

         Notice of a make-whole  redemption shall be accompanied by an Officer's
Certificate  certifying:  (A) the preliminary redemption price (the "Preliminary
Redemption Price"),  including the aggregate applicable principal,  interest and
Make-Whole  Amount,  and (B) the portion of such  Preliminary  Redemption  Price
allocable to each Security of this series.  On or prior to the Redemption  Date,
the Company shall deliver to each Holder of the Securities of this series and to
the Trustee a further Officer's Certificate certifying (X) the Redemption Price,
including the aggregate  applicable  principal,  interest and Make-Whole Amount,
and (Y) the portion of such Redemption  Price allocable to each Security of this
series.

         Any Holder of the  Securities  of this  series  shall have the right to
contest  the  calculation  of any  Redemption  Price  to be paid or paid to such
Holder as the result of any make-whole  redemption by delivering  written notice
to the Company,  within five (5) Business  Days of receipt by such Holder of the
further Officer's  Certificate referred to in the preceding  paragraph,  setting
forth such Holder's  objection.  Within five (5) Business Days of receipt by the
Company  of any such  notice,  the  Company  shall  notify  each  Holder of such
Securities of this series and the Trustee of the nature of such objection and of
the Company's  response thereto.  Any increase in a Redemption Price made by the
Company  as a result  of any such  objection  shall be paid to each  Holder  and
acceptance  thereof  shall not be  deemed  to be a waiver by such  Holder of any
right to  contest  the amount of such  payment;  provided,  that  notice of such
contest has been  delivered to the Company  within five (5) Business  Days after
receipt of such further Officer's Certificate.

         The Trustee  shall be under no duty to inquire into,  may  conclusively
presume  the  correctness  of, and shall be fully  protected  in acting upon the
Company's calculation of any Preliminary  Redemption Price, any Redemption Price
and any increase therein.

         The term "BUSINESS DAY" means any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday
or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or

Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee is closed for business.

         The term "DISCOUNT RATE" means the Treasury Rate plus .50%.

         The term  "MAKE-WHOLE  AMOUNT" means an amount equal to the excess,  if
any, of (A) the sum of the present values, on the day after the Redemption Date,
of the amount of each  remaining  scheduled  payment of interest  (exclusive  of
interest  accrued to the Redemption  Date) on and principal of the Securities of
this series,  or portion of such payment,  which will not be required to be made
as a result of such optional redemption (each such amount discounted  separately
at the Discount  Rate,  to be  determined  (1) with  respect to the  Preliminary
Redemption  Price,  as of the third  Business  Day before the date of mailing of
notice of an optional redemption,  and (2) with respect to the Redemption Price,
as  of  the  third   Business  Day  before  the  Redemption   Date,   compounded
semi-annually,  from the date such  amount  would have been  due),  over (B) the
principal amount of such Securities of this series to be optionally redeemed.

         The  term  "TREASURY  RATE"  means  the  rate  per  annum  equal to the
arithmetic  average of (A) the average yields on issues of  non-callable  United
States Treasury  securities adjusted to a constant maturity equal to the Life to
Maturity  of the  Securities  of  this  series  (determined,  if  necessary,  by
interpolating  such yields on  non-callable  United States  Treasury  securities
adjusted to the particular constant maturities greater than (but nearest to) and
less  than (but  nearest  to) the Life to  Maturity  of the  Securities  of this
series),  as  published  by the Federal  Reserve  Board for release on the first
Business Day  preceding  the Business Day on which such  determination  shall be
made in its Statistical  Release H.15(519) under the heading "Treasury  Constant
Maturities," for the two calendar weeks ending on the two Wednesdays immediately
preceding the date of such release, or (B) if such average yields shall not have
been published for such periods,  two such reasonably  comparable indices as may
be designated  for such period by the Company and not objected to by the Holders
of a majority in aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount of the  Securities of this
series then Outstanding.

         The term "LIFE TO MATURITY" of the Securities of this series means,  as
of the date of the determination thereof, the number of years (calculated to the
nearest one-twelfth) which will elapse between the date of determination and the
Stated Maturity of the Securities of this series.

                  In the event of  redemption  of this  Security in part only, a
new Security or Securities  of this series and of like tenor for the  unredeemed
portion  hereof  will be  issued  in the  name of the  Holder  hereof  upon  the
cancellation hereof.

                  The Indenture  contains  provisions for defeasance at any time
of the  entire  indebtedness  of this  Security  upon  compliance  with  certain
conditions set forth in the Indenture.

                  If an Event of  Default  with  respect to  Securities  of this
series shall occur and be  continuing,  the principal of the  Securities of this
series  may be  declared  due and  payable  in the  manner  and with the  effect
provided in the Indenture.

                  The  Indenture  permits,  with certain  exceptions  as therein
provided,  the  amendment  thereof  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the  Securities  of
each series to be affected  under the  Indenture  at any time by the Company and
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the  Securities at the time  Outstanding of all series to be affected.
The  Indenture  also  contains  provisions  permitting  the Holders of specified
percentages  in aggregate  principal  amount of the Securities of each series at
the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series,
to waive compliance by the

                                      A-4
<PAGE>

Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under
the Indenture and their  consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder
of this Security  shall be conclusive  and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration
of transfer  hereof or in  exchange  herefor or in lieu  hereof,  whether or not
notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

                  As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture,
the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder,  unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a continuing  Event of Default with respect to the
Securities of this series,  the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal  amount of the  Securities of such series at the time  Outstanding  in
respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall
have made written request to the Trustee to institute  proceedings in respect of
such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee  reasonable  indemnity,
and the  Trustee  shall not have  received  from the  Holders of a  majority  in
aggregate  principal  amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding
in respect of which an Event of Default  shall have occurred and be continuing a
direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any
such proceeding,  for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of
indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of
this  Security for the  enforcement  of any payment of  principal  hereof or any
premium  or  interest  hereon on or after  the  respective  due dates  expressed
herein.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Security  or of the  Indenture  shall  alter or  impair  the  obligation  of the
Company,  which is absolute and  unconditional,  to pay the principal of and any
premium and interest on this Security at the times,  place and rate,  and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

                  The  Securities of this series are issuable only in registered
form  without  coupons  in  denominations  of $1,000 and any  integral  multiple
thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  Securities  of this  series are  exchangeable  for a like  aggregate
principal  amount  of  Securities  of  this  series  and of  like  tenor  and of
authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

                  No service charge shall be made for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

                  The  Company,  the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this  Security is  registered  as the
absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue,
and  neither  the  Company,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

                  The Securities of this series are entitled to the benefit of a
Guarantee of Minnesota  Power,  Inc.  (together with its successors and assigns,
the "Guarantor") dated as of March 30, 2000 delivered to the Trustee as provided
therein;  provided,  however,  that such  Guarantee  shall be  terminated if the
obligations of the Company under the Securities of this series and the Indenture
to the  extent  related  to such  series  are  assumed  by  Guarantor  as herein
provided.

                  Unless an Event of Default, or an event which, after notice or
lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and
be  continuing,  the  obligations  of the Company  under the  Securities of this
series and the Indenture to the extent  related to such series may be assumed in
whole, on a full recourse basis, by the Guarantor at any time (and upon any such
assumption

                                      A-5
<PAGE>

the Company  shall be released and  discharged  from its  obligations  under the
Securities  of this  series  and the  Indenture  to the  extent  related to such
series);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that such  assumption  shall be  subject  to, and
permitted only upon the fulfillment and satisfaction of, the following terms and
conditions:  (a) an  assumption  agreement and a  supplemental  indenture to the
Indenture  evidencing such assumption  shall be in substance and form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and shall,  INTER ALIA,  include  modifications  and
amendments to the Indenture making the obligations  under the Securities of this
series and under the  Indenture  to the extent  related to such  series  primary
obligations of the Guarantor,  substituting the Guarantor for the Company in the
form of the  Securities of this series and in provisions of the Indenture to the
extent related to such series,  modifying the Indenture to add the limitation of
lien  provision  contained in the Guarantee  and  substitute  the  cross-default
provision applicable to the Guarantor, and releasing and discharging the Company
from its  obligations  under the  Securities of this series and the Indenture to
the extent  related to such series;  and (b) the Trustee shall have received (i)
an executed counterpart of such assumption agreement and supplemental indenture;
(ii)  evidence  satisfactory  to the Trustee and the Company that all  necessary
authorizations,  consents, orders, approvals,  waivers, filings and declarations
of or with, Federal,  state, county,  municipal,  regional or other governmental
authorities, agencies or boards (collectively,  "Governmental Actions") relating
to such  assumption  have been duly  obtained  and are in full force and effect,
(iii) evidence  satisfactory to the Trustee that any security  interest intended
to be created by the Indenture is not in any material way adversely  affected or
impaired by any of the agreements or  transactions  relating to such  assumption
and (iv) an Opinion of Counsel for the  Guarantor,  reasonably  satisfactory  in
substance, scope and form to the Trustee and the Company, to the effect that (A)
the supplemental  indenture evidencing such assumption has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the  Guarantor,  (B) the execution and delivery by the
Guarantor  of  such   supplemental   indenture  and  the   consummation  of  the
transactions  contemplated thereby do not contravene any provision of law or any
governmental   rule  applicable  to  the  Guarantor  or  any  provision  of  the
Guarantor's charter documents or by-laws and do not contravene any provision of,
or  constitute a default  under,  or result in the creation or imposition of any
lien  upon any of the  Guarantor's  properties  or assets  under any  indenture,
mortgage,  contract or other  agreement to which the  Guarantor is a party or by
which the Guarantor or any of its properties  may be bound or affected,  (C) all
necessary  Governmental  Actions  relating  to such  assumption  have  been duly
obtained  and  are  in  full  force  and  effect  and  (D)  such  agreement  and
supplemental  indenture  constitute the legal, valid and binding  obligations of
the Guarantor,  enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such  enforceability  may  be  limited  by  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws at the time in effect affecting
the rights of creditors generally.

                  All  terms  used in this  Security  which are  defined  in the
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

                                       OF
                              MINNESOTA POWER, INC.

                  For value received,  Minnesota Power, Inc., a corporation duly
organized and existing  under the laws of the State of Minnesota  (herein called
the  "Guarantor"),  hereby fully and  unconditionally  guarantees to the Trustee
under the Indenture,  dated as of May 15, 1996,  between ADESA  Corporation (the
"Company")  and The Bank of New York, as Trustee  (together  with any amendments
thereto,  the  "Indenture,"  which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in
such  instrument),  the  payment of the  obligations  of the  Company  under the
Securities  of the Second  Series and the  Indenture  relating  to such  series,
including, without limitation, (i) the due and punctual payment of the principal
of and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of the Second Series when
and as the same  shall  become due and  payable,  whether  at  maturity  or upon
redemption or upon declaration or otherwise,  according to the terms thereof and
of the Indenture, and (ii) the due and punctual payment of any amounts which may
be payable by the  Company  under or  pursuant  to the Tax  Indemnity  Agreement
referred  to  in  paragraph  16 of  the  Officer's  Certificate  of  William  T.
Stackhouse,  Chief  Financial  Officer of the Company  dated March 30, 2000 (the
"Tax Indemnity  Payments").  In case of the failure of the Company punctually to
pay any such principal,  premium,  if any, or interest or Tax Indemnity Payment,
the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made punctually when
and as the same  shall  become due and  payable,  whether  at  maturity  or upon
redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by
the Company. The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be
full and unconditional, irrespective of the validity, legality or enforceability
of the  Securities  of the Second  Series or the  Indenture,  the absence of any
action  to  enforce  the  same,  the  waiver  or  consent  by the  Holder of the
Securities of the Second Series or by the Trustee with respect to any provisions
thereof or of said Indenture,  the recovery of any judgment  against the Company
or any  action  to  enforce  the  same or any  other  circumstance  which  might
otherwise  constitute a legal or equitable  discharge or defense of a guarantor.
The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of
claims with a court in the event of merger or  bankruptcy  of the  Company,  any
right to require a proceeding first against the Company,  protest or notice with
respect to the  Securities  of the Second Series or the  indebtedness  evidenced
thereby, and all demands whatsoever,  and covenants that this Guarantee will not
be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the
Securities of the Second Series and in this Guarantee.

                  The Guarantor  hereby  guarantees  that the obligations of the
Company  under the  Securities  of the Second  Series and the  Indenture  to the
extent  related to such series will be paid to the  Trustee  without  set-off or
counterclaim or other reduction  whatsoever  (whether for taxes,  withholding or
otherwise) in lawful currency of the United States of America.

                  The obligations of the Guarantor  hereunder are independent of
the obligations of the Company under the Securities of the Second Series and the
Indenture to the extent related to such series, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted  against the Guarantor whether or not an action or
proceeding  is brought  against  the  Company  and whether or not the Company is
joined  in any  such  action  or  proceeding.  The  liability  of the  Guarantor
hereunder  is full and  unconditional  and (to the extent  permitted by law) the
liability  and  obligations  of the Guarantor  hereunder  shall not be released,
discharged,  mitigated,  waived, impaired or affected in whole or in part by any
circumstance  (including any statute of  limitations)  (other than payment) that
might  constitute  a defense  available  to, or  discharge of the Company or the
Guarantor,   including,   without   limitation,   any  termination,   amendment,

                                      B-1

<PAGE>

modification, addition, deletion, supplement or other change to any of the terms
of the Securities of the Second Series or the Indenture, any failure on the part
of the Trustee or any Holder to enforce,  assert or exercise any right, power or
remedy,  any  waiver,  consent,  extension,  renewal,  indulgence,   compromise,
release,  settlement,  refunding or other action or inaction under or in respect
of any obligation or liability of the Company or the Guarantor or the Trustee or
any  Holder,  or any  modification,  compromise,  settlement  or  release by the
Trustee,  or by  operation  of  law or  otherwise,  of  the  obligations  or the
liability of the Company under the Securities of the Second Series,  in whole or
in part.

                  The  Guarantor  agrees  that if at any time all or any part of
any payment at any time received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities
of the Second  Series is or must be rescinded or returned by the Trustee or such
Holders  for  any  reason  whatsoever   (including,   without  limitation,   the
insolvency,  reorganization or bankruptcy of the Company),  then the Guarantor's
obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned,
be deemed to have continued in existence  notwithstanding  such previous receipt
by the Trustee or such Holders, and the Guarantor's  obligations hereunder shall
continue to be effective or  reinstated,  as the case may be, as if such payment
had never been made.

                  The  failure of the  Trustee  to  enforce  any right or remedy
hereunder,  or promptly to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to
enforce any such right or remedy,  shall not  constitute a waiver  thereof,  nor
give rise to any estoppel against the Trustee, nor excuse the Guarantor from its
obligations hereunder.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Guarantee  or of the  Indenture  shall  alter or  impair  the  guarantee  of the
Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional,  of the due and punctual payment
of the  principal  of and  premium,  if any, and interest on the Security of the
series upon which this Guarantee is endorsed and of any Tax Indemnity Payments.

                  The Guarantor  shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder
of the  Securities  of the Second  Series  against the Company in respect of any
amounts paid by the Guarantor  pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee upon
payment by the Guarantor of all amounts due and payable under such Guarantee.

                  This  Guarantee  shall be  irrevocable  unless  terminated  as
provided  herein.  This Guarantee shall be terminated upon the assumption by the
Guarantor of the  obligations  of the Company under the Securities of the Second
Series and the Indenture to the extent related to such series as provided in the
terms of such Securities.

                  All  capitalized  terms used in this  Guarantee  which are not
defined  herein but are defined in the  Indenture  shall have the  meanings  set
forth in the Indenture.

                  This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made under the
laws of the State of New York and  shall for all  purposes  be  governed  by and
construed in accordance with the laws of such State.

                  During the term of this  Guarantee,  the  Guarantor  shall not
consolidate  with or merge into any other  corporation,  or convey or  otherwise
transfer or lease its properties and assets  substantially as an entirety to any
Person, unless

               (a) the corporation  formed by such  consolidation  or into which
      the  Guarantor is merged or the Person  which  acquires by  conveyance  or
      transfer,  or which  leases,  the  properties  and assets of the

                                      B-2
<PAGE>

      Guarantor  substantially  as an entirety  shall be a Person  organized and
      validly existing under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or
      the District of Columbia,  and shall expressly assume,  the obligations of
      the Guarantor under this Guarantee;

               (b) immediately  after giving effect to such transaction no Event
      of Default,  and no event  which,  after  notice or lapse of time or both,
      would become an Event of Default,  shall have occurred and be  continuing;
      and

               (c)  the  Guarantor  shall  have  delivered  to  the  Trustee  an
      Officer's  Certificate (as hereinafter  defined) and an Opinion of Counsel
      (as hereinafter  defined),  each stating that such consolidation,  merger,
      conveyance,  or other  transfer or lease and such  supplemental  indenture
      comply  with  this  Guarantee  and that all  conditions  precedent  herein
      provided for relating to such transactions have been complied with.

               Upon any  consolidation  by the  Guarantor  with or merger by the
Guarantor  into any other  corporation or any  conveyance,  or other transfer or

in  accordance  with this  Section,  the  successor  corporation  formed by such
consolidation  or into which the Guarantor is merged or the Person to which such
conveyance,  transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for,
and may exercise  every right and power of, the Guarantor  under this  Guarantee
and under the terms of the Securities of the Second Series (including assumption
of the  obligations  under the  Securities  of the  Second  Series and under the
Indenture to the extent  related to such series) with the same effect as if such
successor Person had been named as the Guarantor herein, and thereafter,  except
in the  case of a  lease,  the  predecessor  Person  shall  be  relieved  of all
obligations and covenants under this Guarantee.

               redemption  price or prices  not less than the  principal  amount
               thereof  and (z) shall be held by the  Trustee for the benefit of
               the Holders of all  Securities  of the Second Series from time to

               matters as shall be set forth in an indenture supplemental hereto
               specifically  providing  for the  delivery to the Trustee of such

                       3. an Opinion of Counsel (a) if this  Guarantee  is to be
               secured by such Lien,  to the effect that all  Securities  of the
               Second  Series then  Outstanding  are  entitled to the benefit of
               such  Lien  equally  and  ratably  with  all  other  indebtedness
               outstanding under such Lien or (b) if Secured  Obligations are to

               Obligations  have been duly issued under such Lien and constitute
               valid  obligations,  entitled to the benefit of such Lien equally
               and ratably with all other  indebtedness  then outstanding  under

<PAGE>

pursuant to the  provisions of the Note  Indenture,  to disburse the proceeds of
the sale of the Notes in accordance with the disbursement instructions set forth
in the Funding Requisition, such disbursement to constitute the complete funding
of the Loan. The Loan shall (i) be a term loan in the principal  amount of up to
$28,373,000,  (ii) be  evidenced  by the Borrower  Promissory  Note,  (iii) bear
interest from the Closing Date in the amount provided in the Borrower Promissory
Note,  such  interest  to be  payable on each  Interest  Payment  Date,  (iv) be
repayable as to principal as provided in the Borrower  Promissory Note and in no
event later than on the Scheduled  Termination  Date, and (v) be subject to such
other terms and  conditions  as are set forth in the Borrower  Promissory  Note.
Under the Lease, the Lessee has agreed to pay the Credit Rent to the Credit Bank
on each Rent Payment Date,  the proceeds of which,  subject to the provisions of
the  Operative  Documents,  are  intended to  reimburse  the Credit Bank for the
amount of all Drawings and other  Letter of Credit  Obligations  incurred by the
Lessor under the Reimbursement Agreement.

                  (d)      Upon  the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
SECTION 3.1, and concurrent  with the  disbursement of the proceeds of the Loan,
the Lessor  agrees to invest and apply the proceeds of the  Contribution  in the
sum of up to  $877,515.46  to pay Property  Costs in that amount,  in accordance
with the  disbursement  instructions set forth in the Funding  Requisition.  The
Contribution  shall (i) be in the aggregate  amount of $877,515.46,  (ii) be due

of the Lease) on the Lease  Termination Date and in any event not later than the
Scheduled  Termination Date, (iii) bear a pre-tax cumulative annual return equal
to the amount of the Contribution  Return,  which shall be payable in arrears by
the Lessee on each Rent  Payment  Date,  and (iv) be subject to such other terms
and conditions as set forth therein.  Under the Lease,  the Lessee has agreed to
pay the Facility Rent to the Credit Bank, for the account of the Lessor, on each
Rent  Payment  Date the  proceeds  of which,  subject to the  provisions  of the
Operative  Documents,  are intended to pay the Contribution  Return then accrued
and  remaining  unpaid.  The  Contribution  shall be disbursed by the Lessor and
applied according to the instructions set forth in the Funding Requisition.

                  (e)      At the Closing,  the Lessee shall prepare and deliver
the  Funding  Requisition  substantially  in the form set forth in  Appendix  II
hereof,  and shall  cause to be listed  therein the names,  addresses,  taxpayer
identification  information and, where applicable,  wiring  instructions of each
person to whom  Property  Costs are  payable,  and the amount so payable to such
person,  and shall  attach  thereto  the  invoice,  closing  statement  or other
evidence of the amounts due. Not more than ten percent (10%) of the total amount
of the Property  Costs may be delivered to the Lessee as agent of the Lessor for
the subsequent disbursement of Property Costs not payable or required to be paid
at  Closing,  and the  Lessee  shall hold all  monies  delivered  to it for such
purpose as a trust fund to be applied only to the payment of Property  Costs and
for no other  purpose.  The Lessee shall  deliver a written  report  signed by a
Responsible  Officer  setting forth an account of the application of such monies
on each Rent Payment Date  following the Closing until all such monies have been
disbursed  in full.  Any surplus of such monies not  required for the payment of
Property Costs may be applied by the Lessee to pay installments of Basic Rent on
any Rent Payment Date. The Funding Requisition shall be addressed to the Lessor,
the Credit Bank and the  Issuer,  and the  delivery  of the Funding  Requisition
shall  constitute the  representation  and warranty by the Lessee to the Lessor,
the Issuer and the Credit Bank that all the conditions  precedent to the Closing
have been satisfied, including but not limited to those contained in SECTION 3.1
hereof.

         SECTION 2.3    NATURE OF TRANSACTION.  It is the intent of the parties
hereto that:  (a) for financial  accounting  purposes the Lease  constitutes  an
"operating  lease" pursuant to Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
13, as amended;  (b) for purposes of  commercial,  real estate,  bankruptcy  and
federal,  state and local income tax law, the  transactions  contemplated by the
Lease are  financing  arrangements  and shall be  treated as the  repayment  and
security provisions of a loan by the Lessor to the Lessee, and that all payments
of Basic Rent during the Lease Term shall be treated as payments of interest and
all  payments  of Lease  Balance  (except  to the  extent  constituting  accrued
Contribution Return) shall be treated as payments of principal,  as the case may
be,  in  respect  of such  loan;  (c) if a  bankruptcy  court or other  court of
competent  jurisdiction  shall  at any  time  determine  that  the  transactions
represented  by the Lease and the other  Operative  Documents do not  constitute
true leasing transactions, then in any such event, the Lease shall be treated as
a deed of trust and security agreement, mortgage and security agreement or other
similar instrument  granting a lien and security interest,  with a power of sale
from the Lessee,  as mortgagor,  to Lessor for the benefit of the Issuer and the
Credit Bank, as the case may be, as mortgagee, encumbering the related Property,
to secure the Lessee's  performance under and payment of all amounts at any time
due or  payable  under  the Lease and the  other  Operative  Documents,  and the
payment by the Lessee of Basic Rent shall be treated as payments of interest and
the payment by the Lessee of any amounts in respect of the Lease Balance (except
to the extent  constituting  accrued  Contribution  Return)  shall be treated as
repayments of principal (all such payments  being  obligatory and to the fullest
extent  permitted by law, shall have priority over any and all mechanics'  liens
and other  liens and  encumbrances  arising  after each  Memorandum  of Lease is
recorded;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the maximum  amount of unpaid  indebtedness
secured by the Lease,  exclusive of interest and the Contribution  Return, which
may be outstanding at any time shall be $29,250,515),  and (d) each Mortgage and
the Assignment of Lease and Rents shall and hereby do create a lien and security
interest in the Collateral (as defined in each Mortgage) and the Lease,  subject
to the  Excluded  Rights  and to  exceptions,  if any,  set  forth in each  such

acceptance  of an Alternate  Letter of Credit in  accordance  with the terms and
conditions of the Note  Indenture or (iv) the  Expiration  Date of the Letter of

Credit  shall  be  issued  by  a  bank,  a  trust  company  or  other  financial
institution,  shall have administrative terms acceptable to the Note Trustee and
shall in all  respects  material to the Holders of the Notes be the same (except
for the expiration date thereof,  which shall not be earlier than the expiration
date of the  Letter of  Credit  to be  replaced).  In  connection  with any such
request, the Lessee, at its expense,  shall identify the replacement credit bank
which will provide the Alternate  Letter of Credit,  and make such  arrangements
with the replacement  credit bank,  with the Rating Services then  maintaining a
rating  with  respect  to the  Notes,  and with such  other  Persons as shall be
necessary  in order to  satisfy,  and enable the Issuer and the Note  Trustee to
satisfy,  each of the conditions set forth in SECTION 8.05 of the Note Indenture

of  Credit.  Upon  satisfaction  of  such  conditions,  or  providing  for  such
satisfaction on terms acceptable to the Issuer in its sole  discretion,  and the
payment of all of the reasonable expenses, including the reasonable expenses and
fees of legal counsel to the various parties  involved in the  transaction,  the
Issuer shall exercise its rights and powers under the provisions of Section 8.05
of the Note Indenture to effect the replacement of the Letter of Credit with the
Alternate  Letter of  Credit  proposed  by the  Lessee.  In the  event  that any
amendments  to the  provisions  of the Lease,  the  Participation  Agreement the
Reimbursement  Agreement  or  any  of  the  other  Operative  Documents,  or any
replacements  or  supplements  thereto,  are  requested  by  the  Lessee  or the
replacement  credit bank in  connection  with the  issuance  and delivery of the
Alternate  Letter of Credit,  the Lessor and the Issuer shall  cooperate in good
faith in the  consideration,  preparation and execution of any such  amendments,
replacements  or  supplements  provided that all of their  reasonable  costs and
expenses  related  thereto  are  paid in  full by the  Lessee,  the  duties  and
obligations of the Issuer or the Lessor are not materially  increased thereunder
or thereby and the rights and  priveleges of the Issuer and the Lessor shall not
be materially diminished thereunder or thereby.

         SECTION 2.10.  ANNUAL  FEE  OF THE  ISSUER.  In  consideration  of the
administrative  services to be  performed  by Issuer  pursuant to the  Operative
Documents,  the Lessee  shall pay,  as  Supplemental  Rent under the Lease,  the
Issuer's  annual fee for its services in connection  with the Notes and the Note
Indenture at the rate of 0.025% of the par amount of the Notes  Outstanding from
time to time,  such fee to be paid in  monthly  installments  in arrears on each
Interest  Payment  Date in the amount

Notes  outstanding  during the previous  month multiplied  by 0.025%.  To the

forfeiture,  and with respect to which the Lessee or a  Subsidiary,  as the case
may be, has established  adequate  reserves in accordance with GAAP; it knows of
no basis for any other tax or  assessment  that could  reasonably be expected to

asserted that it has incurred any material liability in connection with any such
pension  plan nor has any lien  attached nor any Person  threatened  to attach a
lien on any of its  property  as a  result  of the  failure  of it or any of its
Affiliates to comply with ERISA or regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (n)      SOLVENCY.   The  transactions  contemplated  by  this

date, a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein
and therein not misleading.  There are no facts known to it which,  individually
or in the  aggregate,  materially  adversely  affect,  or  could  reasonably  be
expected to materially  adversely affect, the condition,  business or affairs of
the Lessee and its Subsidiaries or their respective properties and assets, taken
as a whole,  which  have not  been  disclosed  herein  or in  written  materials
delivered to any other party hereto in connection  with the  negotiation  of the
Operative Documents.

                  (p)      TITLE TO COLLATERAL. It owns good and marketable
title to all  collateral  pledged as security for its  obligations in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Participation Agreement and the other
Operative  Documents  free and clear of all liens  and  encumbrances,  except as
disclosed in writing to the Credit Bank, the Lessor and the Issuer.

                  (q)      OTHER  OBLIGATIONS.  It is not a party to or bound by
any agreement,  contract,  instrument or understanding or commitment of any kind
or subject to any corporate or other restriction,  the performance or observance
of which by it now or, as far it can  reasonably  foresee,  will have a Material
Adverse  Effect,  financial  or  otherwise,  upon the assets or  business of the
Lessee  and its  Subsidiaries  taken as a whole;  and  neither  it nor any other
person or party to a contract or agreement  material to its financial  condition
or  operations,  taken as a whole,  is in  default  under any such  contract  or
agreement,  and no event has occurred which, but for the giving of notice or the
passage of time, or both, would constitute a default thereunder.

                  (r)      FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.  The  consolidated   financial
statements of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries for the period most recently ended
before the Closing Date,  heretofore  furnished

GAAP, omit no material contingent liabilities of any kind that are not disclosed
or otherwise reflected therein,  and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated  financial  condition of the Lessee and its  Subsidiaries as of the
date  thereof  and the  results of their  operations  for the period then ended.
Since  the date  thereof,  there  has been no  material  adverse  change  in the
financial condition, properties or businesses of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries
which has not been  disclosed in writing by the Lessee to the Credit  Bank,  the
Lessor and the Issuer.

                  (s)      QUALIFICATION  OF  REPRESENTATIONS.  Notwithstanding
any other provision of this SECTION 4.1 to the contrary,  the representations of
the Lessee set forth in this Section are  qualified by the  conditions  that (i)
all  representations  (including,  without  limitation,  the representations set
forth in SECTION  4.1(h)  above) are made and given to the best of  knowledge of
the Lessee,  (ii) where a representation  involves compliance by the Lessee with
an Applicable Law or an Environmental Law such representation is deemed to be as
to compliance by the Lessee in all material respects with any such law and (iii)
where a representation  involves conduct on the part of the Lessee that does not
violate an Applicable Law or an Environmental Law, such representation is deemed
to exclude any non-material violations of any such law.

         SECTION 4.2    REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS OF LESSOR. Effective as of
the date of execution  hereof, as of the Closing Date, the Lessor represents and
warrants to and  covenants  with the Credit  Bank,  the Issuer and the Lessee as
follows:

                  (a)      DUE  ORGANIZATION;  LIMITED  PURPOSE.  Lessor is a
limited  partnership  duly organized and validly existing in good standing under
the laws of the State of Ohio; is duly qualified to conduct  business in, and is
in good standing  under the laws of, each state where such  qualification,  good
standing and authority is or will be required in connection with the performance
of its duties under the Operative Documents;  and has full power,  authority and
legal  right  to  execute,  deliver  and  perform  its  obligations  under  this
Participation Agreement and each other Operative Document to which it is or will
be a party. The Lessor further  represents,  covenants and warrants that (i) the
Lessor  has been  organized  and exists  for the sole  purpose  of, and will not
engage in any business or other activity except as necessary in connection with,
the  Lessor's  acquiring  and owning the Leased  Property and taking the actions
contemplated on Lessor's part under the Operative  Documents and (ii) except for
obligations  and  indebtedness  of  Lessor  represented  by and set forth in the
Operative Documents and except for obligations or indebtedness of Lessor arising
directly or indirectly  from failure of the Lessee or the Guarantor to discharge
their respective obligations under the Operative Documents,  the Lessor (whether
as trustee or in its individual  capacity) will not create,  incur, suffer to be
created or incurred, or guarantee any obligation or indebtedness relating to, or
encumbering, the Leased Property.

                  (b)      DUE AUTHORIZATION;  ENFORCEABILITY, ETC. The
Participation Agreement and each other Operative Document to which the Lessor is
or will be a party have been or will be duly authorized,  executed and delivered
by or on behalf of the Lessor and are, or upon  execution  and delivery will be,
legal,  valid and binding  obligations of the Lessor  enforceable  against it in
accordance with their respective  terms,  except as such  enforceability  may be
limited  by  applicable  bankruptcy,   insolvency,  or  similar  laws  affecting
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles.

<PAGE>

                  (c)      NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery by the Lessor
of this  Participation  Agreement and each other Operative Document to which the
Lessor  is or will be a party are not or will not,  and the  performance  by the
Lessor  of its  obligations  under  each  do  not  and  will  not,  violate  its
certificate  of  incorporation  or by-laws,  do not and will not  contravene any
Applicable  Law  and do not  and  will  not  contravene  any  provision  of,  or
constitute a default under, any Contractual Obligation of the Lessor, and Lessor
possesses  all  requisite  regulatory  authority  to  undertake  and perform its
obligations under the Operative Documents.

                  (d)      LITIGATION.  There are no pending or threatened
actions  or  proceedings   against  Lessor  before  any  court,   arbitrator  or
administrative agency that would have a material adverse effect upon the ability
of Lessor to perform its obligations under this  Participation  Agreement or any
other Operative Documents to which it is or will be a party.

                  (e)      LESSOR  LIENS. No Lessor Liens or other Liens created
by  acts or  omissions  of  Lessor  (whether  as  trustee  or in its  individual
capacity)  (other than Liens  created by the Operative  Documents)  exist on the
Closing Date on the Leased Property,  or any portion thereof, and the execution,
delivery and performance by Lessor of this Participation  Agreement or any other
Operative Document to which it is or will be a party will not subject the Leased
Property,  or any portion thereof, to any Lessor Liens or other Liens created by
Lessor  (other than by the  Operative  Documents).  Except for Liens against the
Leased Property created by the Operative Documents,  Permitted Liens (other than
Lessor Liens),  Liens  (including  Lessor Liens) arising  directly or indirectly
from the  Lessee's  failure to  discharge  the  Lessee's  obligations  under the
Operative Documents, the Lessor further represents and warrants that it will not
create, suffer to be created or permit any Liens on the Leased Property.

                  (f)      EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS. The Lessor is not and will
not be making its Contribution hereunder,  and is not performing its obligations
under the Operative Documents, with the assets of an "employee benefit plan" (as
defined in  Section  3(3) of ERISA)  which is  subject  to Title I of ERISA,  or
"plan" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code).

                  (g)      GOVERNMENTAL  REGULATION.  The  Lessor  is not an
"investment  company"  or a company  "controlled"  by an  "investment  company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

                  (h)      USE OF PROCEEDS;  MARGIN  REGULATIONS. To the best of
the Lessor's knowledge,  no part of the proceeds of the Borrower Promissory Note
will be used, directly or indirectly,  for the purpose of buying or carrying any
margin stock within the meaning of Regulation G of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or
trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Lessor in a
violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or
dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220).

                  (i)      PAYMENT OF TAXES AND  CLAIMS.  The Lessor will cause
to be  filed  on its  behalf,  all  tax  returns  required  to be  filed  in any
jurisdiction and pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on such
returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

levies imposed on them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises,
to the extent such taxes and assessments  have become due and payable and before
they have  become  delinquent  and all claims for which sums have become due and
payable that have or might become a Lien on  properties or assets of the Lessor,
provided  that the Lessor need not pay any such tax or  assessment  or claims if
(i) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by the Lessor, or
any Person on its  behalf,  on a timely  basis in good faith and in  appropriate
proceedings  or (ii) the  nonpayment  of all such taxes and  assessments  in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect on
the Lessee's ability to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under the
Operative Documents.

                  (j)      MAINTENANCE OF  PROPERTIES. The  Lessor will use
reasonable  efforts to enforce the  obligation  of the Lessee under the Lease to
maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained  and kept,  the Leased  Property in
good repair, working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so
that the business carried on in connection  therewith may be properly  conducted
at all times.

                  (k)      SINGLE  PURPOSE  ENTITY/SEPARATENESS.  Without the
written consent of the Credit Bank and the Lessee  (provided that the consent of
the Credit Bank shall not be required  after the Letter of Credit has terminated
in  accordance  with its terms and all  Letter of Credit  Liabilities  have been
satisfied),  except  as  shall  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  perform  its
obligations under the Operative Documents:

                           (i)     Lessor will not own any asset or property
other  than  (A) the  Leased  Property,  and (B)  incidental  personal  property
necessary for the ownership or operation of the Leased  Property and performance
of its obligations under the Operative Documents.

                           (ii)    Lessor will not engage in any business other
than the ownership,  management and operation of the Leased Property pursuant to
the Operative Documents and any activity incidental or related thereto.

                           (iii)   Lessor  will not enter into any  contract  or
agreement with any affiliate of the Lessor,  any  constituent  partner or member
("constituent  party") of Lessor, or any affiliate of any constituent partner or
member,  except  upon  terms  and  conditions  that are  intrinsically  fair and
substantially  similar to those that would be available on an arms-length  basis
with third parties other than any such party.

                           (iv)    Lessor will not incur any  indebtedness,
secured or  unsecured,  direct or indirect,  absolute or  contingent  (including
guaranteeing any obligation), other than (i) the Loan, (ii) the Letter of Credit
Liabilities,  and (iii) trade and  operational  debt  incurred  in the  ordinary
course of business with trade  creditors in amounts as are normal and reasonable
under the circumstances.

                           (v)     Lessor  will not make any  loans or  advances
to any third  party  (including  any  affiliate  or  constituent  party,  or any
affiliate  of any  constituent  party),  and shall not  acquire  obligations  or
securities of its affiliates or any constituent party.

                                      -19-


<PAGE>

                           (vi)    Lessor shall remain solvent and pay its debts
and  liabilities  (including,  as  applicable,  shared  personnel  and  overhead
expenses) from its assets as the same shall become due.

                           (vii)   Lessor will do all things reasonably
necessary to observe organizational  formalities and preserve its existence, and
Lessor will not, nor will Lessor permit any constituent  party to amend,  modify
or otherwise  change the partnership  certificate,  the  partnership  agreement,
articles of incorporation and bylaws, trust or other organizational documents of
Lessor or such constituent party.

                           (viii)  Lessor will maintain all of its books,
records,  financial  statements  and bank  accounts  separate  from those of its
affiliates and any  constituent  party and Lessor will file its own tax returns.
Lessor shall maintain its books, records, resolutions and agreements as official
records.

                           (ix)    Lessor  will be, and at all times will hold
itself out to the public as, a legal entity separate and distinct from any other
entity  (including any affiliate of Lessor or any constituent  party of Lessor),
shall  correct  any known  misunderstanding  regarding  its status as a separate
entity, shall conduct business in its own name, shall not identify itself or any
of its  affiliates  as a division  or part of the other and shall  maintain  and
utilize  separate  stationery,  invoices and checks,  except that nothing herein
shall  prevent  Lessor from  engaging a manager,  agent or contractor to perform
services on behalf of Lessor in such manager's, agent's or contractor's name.

                           (x)     Neither  Lessor nor any  constituent  party
will seek the dissolution,  winding up, liquidation,  consolidation or merger in
whole or in part, of the Lessor.

                           (xi)    Lessor will not commingle the funds and other
assets of Lessor  with  those of any  affiliate  or  constituent  party,  or any
affiliate of any constituent party, or any other Person.

                           (xii)   Lessor  will  maintain its assets in such a
manner  that it will not be costly  or  difficult  to  segregate,  ascertain  or
identify its individual  assets from those of any affiliate or constituent party
or any affiliate of any constituent party, or any other Person.

                           (xii)   Lessor   will  not  hold  itself  out  to  be
responsible for the debts or obligations of any other Person.

         SECTION 4.3    COVENANT OF THE CREDIT BANK. Upon payment by Lessee to
the Credit Bank of the  purchase  price for the related  Properties  pursuant to
ARTICLE XV of the Lease,  the Credit Bank will release the lien of the Operative
Documents against the related Property.

         SECTION 4.4    TAX TREATMENT.  (a) The parties hereto agree that it is
the Lessor's and Lessee's intention that for Federal, state and local income Tax
purposes (i) the Lease be treated as the repayment and security  provisions of a
loan to the Lessee,  all rights to the principal and interest of which have been
assigned  by the  Lessor to the Credit  Bank,  (ii) the Lessee be treated as the
legal

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

and  beneficial  owners  entitled to any and all  benefits of  ownership  of the
related  Properties or any part thereof and (iii) all payments of Basic Rent and
Lease  Balance,  respectively,  during the Lease Term be treated as  payments of
interest and principal, as the case may be, under the Borrower Promissory Note.

                  (b)      The Lessee  agrees  that neither it nor any member of
     any affiliated  group of which it is or may become a member (whether or not
consolidated  or  combined  returns  are  filed  for such  affiliated  group for
Federal,  state or local income Tax purposes)  will at any time take any action,
directly or indirectly,  or file any return or other document  inconsistent with
the intended income Tax treatment set forth in SECTION 4.4(a) hereof, and agrees
that it and any such Affiliates  will file such returns,  maintain such records,
take such actions and execute such documents as may be appropriate to facilitate
the realization of such intended income Tax treatment.

                  (c)      The Lessor agrees that, except to the extent required
     by law, neither it nor any member of any affiliated group of which it is or
may become a member (whether or not  consolidated or combined  returns are filed
for such affiliated group for Federal,  state or local income Tax purposes) will
at any time take any action, directly or indirectly, or file any return or other
document claiming,  or asserting that it is entitled to the income Tax benefits,
deductions  and/or credits which,  pursuant to the intended income Tax treatment
set forth in SECTION 4.4 (a) hereof,  would otherwise be claimed or claimable by
the  Lessee,  and that it and any such  Affiliates  will at the  expense  of the
Lessee file such returns,  maintain such records, take such actions, and execute
such documents (as reasonably  requested by the Lessee from time to time) as may
be  appropriate  to facilitate  the  realization  of, and as shall be consistent
with, such intended income Tax treatment,  other than engaging in any contest of
such treatment with any taxing authority,  and if any such filing,  maintenance,
action or  execution  requested  by the Lessee  would  result in any  additional
income Tax liability or expense payable by the Lessor or any Affiliate, or could
reasonably  be expected to result in liability  or expense  payable by it or any
Affiliate,  then the Lessee will  provide an  indemnity  against such income Tax
liability or other  liability  satisfactory to the Lessor or the Credit Bank, as
the case may be, in the Lessor's or the Credit Bank's sole opinion,  as the case
may be.

         SECTION 4.5    REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS OF ISSUER. Effective as of
the date of execution  hereof and as of the Closing Date, the Issuer  represents

                  (c)      NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery by the Issuer

other Operative Documents to which it is or will be a party.

                  (e)      SEPARATENESS  COVENANTS OF THE ISSUER. Without the

hold itself out to the public as, a legal entity  separate and distinct from any
other  entity  (including  any  affiliate  of the Issuer or any  stockholder  of
Issuer),  shall  correct any known  misunderstanding  regarding  its status as a
separate  entity,  shall conduct business in its own name (unless in the opinion

other and shall maintain and utilize separate  stationery,  invoices and checks,

         (a)  COMPLIANCE  WITH LAW. The Lessee will,  and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries  to,  comply with all laws,  ordinances  or  governmental  rules or
regulations  to which each of them is subject,  including,  without  limitation,
Environmental  Laws,  and will  obtain  and  maintain  in effect  all  licenses,
certificates,   permits,   franchises  and  other  governmental   authorizations
necessary to the ownership of their  respective  properties or to the conduct of
their respective businesses, in each case to the extent necessary to ensure that
non-compliance  with such laws,  ordinances or governmental rules or regulations
or  failures  to  obtain or  maintain  in effect  such  licenses,  certificates,
permits,   franchises   and  other   governmental   authorizations   could  not,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         (b)  PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS.  The Lessee will,  and will
cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, file all tax returns required to be filed in
any  jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable
on such  returns and all other  taxes,  assessments,  governmental  charges,  or
levies imposed on them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises,
to the extent such taxes and assessments  have become due and payable and before
they have  become  delinquent  and all claims for which sums have become due and
payable that have or might become a Lien on  properties  or assets of the Lessee
or any Subsidiary,  provided that neither the Lessee nor any Subsidiary need pay
any such  tax or  assessment  or  claims  if (i) the  amount,  applicability  or
validity thereof is contested by the Lessee or such Subsidiary on a timely basis
in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and the Lessee or a Subsidiary has
established  adequate  reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of
the  Lessee or such  Subsidiary  or (ii) the  nonpayment  of all such  taxes and
assessments in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         (c)  CORPORATE EXISTENCE. The Lessee will at all times preserve and
keep in full force and effect its  corporate  existence.  The Lessee will at all
times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of each
of its  Subsidiaries  (unless  merged into the Lessee or a  Subsidiary)  and all
rights and  franchises of the Lessee and its  Subsidiaries  unless,  in the good
faith judgment of the Lessee, the termination of or failure to preserve and keep
in full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise could not,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         (d)  MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES.  The Lessee will and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and kept, their
respective  properties in good repair,  working order and condition  (other than
ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in connection therewith
may be properly conducted at all times,  provided that this SECTION 5.4(d) shall
not prevent the Lessee or any Subsidiary  from  discontinuing  the operation and
the maintenance of any of its properties if such  discontinuance is desirable in
the  conduct  of  its   business  and  the  Lessee  has   concluded   that  such
discontinuance  could  not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.5 FINANCIAL  COVENANTS.  The Lessee shall at all times comply
with the agreements and covenants set forth in SCHEDULE I hereof.

any time during which the Lessee or any  Affiliate  thereof owns any interest in
or otherwise  occupies or possesses the Leased Property or any portion  thereof;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the Lessee  shall not be  required  to  indemnify  any
Indemnitee  under  this  Section  for any Claim to the  extent  that such  Claim
results  from the willful  misconduct  or gross  negligence  of such  Indemnitee
(except that the exception set forth in the immediately  preceding PROVISO shall
not apply to Lessor  Indemnitees,  which the  Lessee  shall,  in any  event,  be
obligated to indemnify, except as provided in SECTION 18.12 of the Lease). It is

         SECTION  7.3  PROCEEDINGS  IN RESPECT OF CLAIMS.  The  obligations  and
liabilities  of the Lessee with respect to any Claims for which,  if valid,  the
Lessee is obligated to provide  indemnification  pursuant to the  provisions  of
SECTION  7.1 and  SECTION 7.2  ("Indemnified  Claims"),  shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

              (a)      Whenever an Indemnitee shall have received notice that an
Indemnified Claim has been asserted or threatened  against such Indemnitee,  the
Indemnitee  shall  promptly  notify  the  Lessee of such  Claim,  together  with
supporting  facts and data within the  possession or knowledge of the Indemnitee
related  thereto,  provided  that the failure to deliver  such notice  shall not
relieve the Lessee of its  indemnification  obligations  hereunder except to the
extent that such failure prejudices the Lessee.  With respect to any amount that
the Lessee is requested by an Indemnitee to pay by reason of SECTION 7.1 or 7.2,
such  Indemnitee  shall, if so requested by the Lessee and prior to any payment,
submit such  additional  information  to the Lessee as the Lessee may reasonably
request  and  which is in the  possession  of such  Indemnitee  to  substantiate
properly the requested payment.

              (b)      The Lessee  shall  defend,  at the expense of the Lessee,
such  Indemnified   Claim  with  counsel  of  the  Lessee's  choice   reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the Indemnitee shall have the right, upon notice
to the Lessee and at the expense of the Lessee, to undertake the defense of such
Claim during the  continuance  of such Event of Default.  The  Indemnitee  shall
promptly notify the Lessee of any compromise or settlement proposal with respect
to any such Claim and shall not unreasonably  refuse to accept any such proposal
if the same is acceptable to the Lessee.  The  Indemnitee  may  participate in a
reasonable  manner at its own expense and with its own counsel in any proceeding
conducted by Lessee in  accordance  with the  foregoing.  Lessee shall not enter
into any  settlement  or other  compromise  with  respect to any Claim  which is
entitled to be  indemnified  under  SECTION 7.1 or 7.2 without the prior written
consent of the affected  Indemnitee,  which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably
withheld.  The Lessee and each  Indemnitee  are and shall be bound to  cooperate
with each other in good faith in connection with the defense of any such action,
suit or  proceeding  in  providing  any  information  and bear  witness  or give
testimony which may be requested by counsel for any of such parties.

              (c)      Unless an Event of Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing,  no Indemnitee  shall enter into any settlement or other  compromise
with respect to any Claim which is entitled to be indemnified  under SECTION 7.1
or 7.2 without the prior written consent of the Lessee,  which consent shall not
be unreasonably  withheld (it being agreed that it will not be unreasonable  for
Lessee to withhold consent if such compromise or settlement  adversely affects a
material right or property interest of Lessee,  including,  without  limitation,
the Lessee's  use,  title or  possession  of the Leased  Property),  unless such
Indemnitee  waives its right to be  indemnified  under  SECTION  7.1 or 7.2 with
respect  to such  Claim,  PROVIDED  that no  Indemnitee  shall  enter  into  any
settlement which would adversely affect the Lessee's use, title to or possession
of the Leased Property without the Lessee's prior written consent.

              (d)      Upon  payment in full of any Claim by Lessee pursuant  to
SECTION 7.1 or 7.2 to or on behalf of an  Indemnitee,  the  Lessee,  without any
further  action,  shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee
may have relating  thereto  (other than claims in respect of insurance  policies
maintained by such Indemnitee at its own expense)  including  claims (subject to
the provisions of this SECTION 7 and SECTION 18.12 of the Lease) against another
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee  shall execute such instruments of assignment and
conveyance, evidence of claims and payment and such other documents, instruments
and  agreements  as may be necessary  to preserve any such Claims and  otherwise
cooperate  with Lessee and give such  further  assurances  as are  necessary  or
advisable to enable Lessee vigorously to pursue such Claims.

              (e)      Any amount  payable to an  Indemnitee pursuant to SECTION
7.1 or 7.2 shall be paid to such  Indemnitee  promptly upon receipt of a written
demand  therefor  from  such  Indemnitee,  accompanied  by a  written  statement
describing in reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the computation
of the amount so payable,  and if requested by Lessee,  such determination shall
be verified by a nationally  recognized  independent  accounting  firm  mutually
acceptable to Lessee and the Indemnitee at the expense of Lessee.

              (f)      If Lessee fails to assume the  defense of an  Indemnified
Claim  within a  reasonable  time (and in any event not more than 30 days) after
receipt  of notice  thereof  from the  Indemnitee,  the  Indemnitee  will  (upon
delivering  notice to such  effect to Lessee)  have the right to  undertake,  at
Lessee's cost and expense,  the defense,  compromise or settlement of such Claim
on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Lessee, subject to the right of
the Lessee  (PROVIDED  no Event of  Default  shall have  occurred  and  remained
outstanding)  to  assume  the  defense  of such  Claim at any time  prior to the
settlement,  compromise or final  determination  thereof,  and PROVIDED HOWEVER,
that the  Indemnitee  shall not enter  into any such  compromise  or  settlement
without the  written  consent of the  Lessee,  which  shall not be  unreasonably
withheld, as aforesaid, and PROVIDED FURTHER that no Indemnitee shall enter into
any such settlement  which would adversely  affect the Lessee's use, title to or
possession of the Leased Property without the Lessee's prior written consent. In
the event the Indemnitee  assumes the defense of any such Claim,  the Indemnitee
will cooperate with the Lessee in keeping the Lessee reasonably  informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement.

              (g)      Nothing  contained in this SECTION 7.3 shall be deemed to
expand  the  obligation  of  the  Lessee  to  defend  or  be   responsible   for
indemnification of the Indemnitees with respect to any Claim beyond the specific
indemnification obligations set forth in SECTIONS 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, or elsewhere in
the Operative Documents.

         SECTION 7.4   GENERAL TAX INDEMNITY.

              (a)      Except as otherwise  provided in this Section, the Lessee
shall pay on an After-Tax  Basis, and on written demand shall indemnify and hold
each Tax  Indemnitee  harmless  from and against,  any and all fees  (including,
without limitation,  documentation,  recording,  license and registration fees),
taxes (including,  without limitation,  income,  gross receipts,  sales, rental,
use, turnover, value-added,  property, excise and stamp taxes), levies, imposts,
duties, charges, assessments or withholdings of any nature whatsoever,  together
with any penalties,  fines or interest thereon or additions  thereto (any of the
foregoing  being referred to herein as "Taxes" and

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

individually  as a "Tax" (for the purposes of this  Section,  the  definition of
"Taxes"  excludes  amounts imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against each Tax
Indemnitee as the result of any  prohibited  transaction,  within the meaning of
Section 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section  4975(c) of the Code,  arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Operative Document)) imposed on
or with respect to any Tax  Indemnitee,  the Lessee,  the Leased Property or any
portion  thereof or the Land, or any  sublessee or user  thereof,  by the United
States or by any state or local  government  or other  taxing  authority  in the
United States in connection with or in any way relating to (i) the  acquisition,
financing,  mortgaging,  construction,  preparation,  installation,  inspection,
delivery, non-delivery,  acceptance, rejection, purchase, ownership, possession,
rental,  lease,  sublease,  maintenance,  repair,  storage,  transfer  of title,
redelivery,  use,  operation,  condition,  sale,  return or other application or
disposition  of all or any part of the Leased  Property or the imposition of any
Lien,  other than a Lessor Lien (or incurrence of any liability to refund or pay
over any amount as a result of any Lien, other than a Lessor Lien) thereon, (ii)
Basic Rent or  Supplemental  Rent or the  receipts or earnings  arising  from or
received  with  respect  to the  Leased  Property  or any part  thereof,  or any
interest therein or any applications or dispositions  thereof,  (iii) the Leased
Property,  the Land or any part thereof or any interest therein, (iv) all or any
of the Operative  Documents,  any other documents  contemplated  thereby and any
amendments  and  supplements  thereto and (v)  otherwise  with  respect to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents.

              (b)      SECTION 7.4(a) shall not apply to:

                       (i)      Taxes  on,  based  on,  or  measured  by or with
         respect to, net income of Lessor, the Holders, the Issuer or the Credit
         Bank  (including,  without  limitation,  minimum  Taxes,  capital gains
         Taxes,  Taxes on or measured by items of tax  preference or alternative
         minimum  Taxes)  other than (A) any such Taxes that are,  or are in the
         nature  of,  sales,  use,  license,   rental  or  property  Taxes,  (B)
         withholding  Taxes  imposed  by the  United  States or any state (1) on
         payments  with  respect  to the  Letter  of Credit  Liabilities  or the
         Borrower  Promissory  Note, to the extent imposed by reason of a change
         in Applicable  Law occurring  after the Closing Date or (2) on Rent, to
         the extent the net payment of Rent after deduction of such  withholding
         Taxes would be less than amounts  currently payable with respect to the
         Letter of Credit  Liabilities or the Borrower  Promissory  Note and (C)
         any increase in any franchise  taxes based on or otherwise  measured by
         net income, estate,  inheritance,  transfer, income tax or gross income
         or gross receipts tax in lieu of net income over the term of the Lease,
         net of any decrease in such taxes realized by such Tax  Indemnitee,  to
         the extent that such tax increase or decrease  would not have  occurred
         if on the Closing Date Lessor had advanced  funds to Lessee in the form
         of a loan  secured by the  Leased  Property  in an amount  equal to the
         Loan, with debt service for such loan equal to the portion of the Basic
         Rent  attributable  to the Loan payable on each Rent Payment Date and a
         principal  balance at the  maturity of such loan in an amount  equal to
         the Loan at the end of the Lease Term;

                       (ii)     Taxes  on,  based  on,  or in the  nature of or
         measured  by, Taxes on doing  business,  business  privilege,  capital,
         capital stock, net worth, or mercantile  license or similar taxes other
         than (A) any increase in such Taxes  imposed on such Tax  Indemnitee by
         any  state,  net of any  decrease  in such taxes  realized  by such Tax
         Indemnitee,  to the extent that such tax increase or decrease would not
         have  occurred if on the Closing Date Lessor had advanced  funds to the
         Lessee  in the form of a loan  secured  by the  Leased  Property  in an

                                      -32-


<PAGE>

         amount equal to the principal  amount of the Borrower  Promissory  Note
         plus the  Contribution,  with debt  service  for such loan equal to the
         portion  of the  Basic  Rent  attributable  to  the  Letter  of  Credit
         Liabilities  and the  Borrower  Promissory  Note  and the  Contribution
         Return payable on each Rent Payment Date and a principal balance at the
         maturity  of such loan in an amount  equal to the Lease  Balance at the
         end of the Lease Term or (B) any Taxes that are or are in the nature of
         sales, use, rental, license or property Taxes;

                       (iii)    Taxes  that  result  from  any  act,  event or
         omission,  or are attributable to any period of time, that occurs after
         the  earliest of (A) the  expiration  of the Lease Term with respect to
         the Leased  Property  and,  if the Leased  Property  is  required to be
         returned to Lessor in  accordance  with the Lease,  such return and (B)
         the  discharge  in full of the  Lessee's  obligations  to pay the Lease
         Balance, or any amount determined by reference thereto, with respect to
         the Leased  Property and all other amounts due under the Lease,  unless
         such Taxes  relate to acts,  events or matters  occurring  prior to the
         earliest  of  such  times  or are  imposed  on or with  respect  to any
         payments due under the  Operative  Documents  after such  expiration or
         discharge;

                       (iv)     Taxes  imposed on a Tax  Indemnitee  that result
         from any voluntary sale,  assignment,  transfer or other disposition by
         such Tax  Indemnitee  or any related Tax  Indemnitee of any interest in
         the Leased Property or any part thereof, or any interest therein or any
         interest or obligation arising under the Operative Documents (including
         a sale of an  interest  in the  Borrower  Promissory  Note) or from any
         sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any interest in such
         Tax Indemnitee or any related Tax Indemnitee,  it being understood that
         each of the following shall not be considered a voluntary sale: (A) any
         substitution, replacement or removal of any part of any Property by the
         Lessee  shall  not  be  treated  as  a  voluntary  action  of  any  Tax
         Indemnitee, (B) any sale or transfer resulting from the exercise by the
         Lessee of any termination  option,  any purchase option or sale option,
         (C) any sale or transfer  while an Event of Default shall have occurred
         and be  continuing  under  the  Lease  and  (D) any  sale  or  transfer
         resulting from Lessor's exercise of remedies under the Lease;

                       (v)      any Tax which is being contested in accordance
         with the  provisions  of SECTION  7.4(c),  during the  pendency of such
         contest;

                       (vi)     any Tax that is imposed on a Tax Indemnitee as a
         result of such Tax Indemnitee's  gross negligence or willful misconduct
         (other   than   gross   negligence   on  the  part  of  Lessor  or  the
         incorporators,  stockholders, directors, officers, employees and agents
         of Lessor or gross negligence or willful  misconduct imputed to Lessor,
         the  Holders,  the Issuer or the Credit  Bank solely by reason of their
         respective interests in the Leased Property);

                       (vii)    any Tax  that  results  from a Tax  Indemnitee
         engaging,  with respect to the Leased Property,  in transactions  other
         than those permitted by the Operative Documents; or

                       (viii)   to the  extent  any  interest,  penalties  or
         additions  to tax result in whole or in part from the  failure of a Tax
         Indemnitee to file a return that it is required to file in a

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

         proper and timely  manner,  unless such  failure  (A) results  from the
         transactions  contemplated by the Operative  Documents in circumstances
         where Lessee did not give timely notice to Lessor (and Lessor otherwise
         had no actual  knowledge)  of such filing  requirement  that would have
         permitted a proper and timely filing of such return or (B) results from
         the failure of Lessee to supply  information  necessary  for the proper
         and timely  filing of such  return  that was not in the  possession  of
         Lessor.

              (c)      If any claim shall be made against any Tax Indemnitee  or
if any proceeding  shall be commenced  against any Tax  Indemnitee  (including a
written notice of such proceeding) for any Taxes as to which the Lessee may have
an indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section, or if any Tax Indemnitee shall
determine that any Taxes as to which the Lessee may have an indemnity obligation
pursuant to this  Section may be payable,  such Tax  Indemnitee  shall  promptly
notify Lessee.  Lessee shall be entitled,  at its expense, to participate in and
to the extent that Lessee  desires to,  assume and control the defense  thereof;
provided,  however,  that Lessee shall not be entitled to assume and control the
defense of any such action,  suit or proceeding  (but the Tax  Indemnitee  shall
then  contest,  at the sole cost and expense of Lessee,  on behalf of Lessee) if
and to the extent that (A) an Event of Default has occurred  and is  continuing,
(B) such action,  suit or proceeding involves matters which are unrelated to the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents and if determined adversely
could  be  materially  detrimental  to the  interests  of  such  Tax  Indemnitee
notwithstanding indemnification by Lessee or (C) such action, suit or proceeding
involves  the federal or any state income tax  liability of the Tax  Indemnitee.
With respect to any contests controlled by a Tax Indemnitee, (i) if such contest
relates to the federal or any state income tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee,
such Tax  Indemnitee  shall be required to conduct  such  contest only if Lessee
shall have provided to such Tax Indemnitee an opinion of independent tax counsel
selected by Lessee and reasonably  satisfactory  to the Tax  Indemnitee  stating
that a  reasonable  basis exists to contest such claim or (ii) in the case of an
appeal of an adverse  determination  of any contest  relating  to any Taxes,  an
opinion of such  counsel to the effect  that such appeal is more likely than not
to be successful;  provided,  however,  such Tax Indemnitee shall in no event be
required to appeal an adverse  determination to the United States Supreme Court.
The Tax Indemnitee may participate in a reasonable manner at its own expense and
with its own counsel in any  proceeding  conducted by Lessee in accordance  with
the foregoing.  Each Tax Indemnitee shall at Lessee's expense supply Lessee with
such information and documents  reasonably  requested by Lessee as are necessary
or advisable for Lessee to participate in any action,  suit or proceeding to the
extent permitted by this Section. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing,  no Tax  Indemnitee  shall enter into any settlement or other
compromise  with respect to any Claim which is entitled to be indemnified  under
this Section  without the prior written  consent of Lessee,  which consent shall
not be  unreasonably  withheld (it being agreed that it will not be unreasonable
for Lessee to withhold  consent if such compromise or settlement would adversely
affect  material  rights or property  interests  of Lessee,  including,  without
limitation,  the Lessee's  use,  title or  possession  of the Leased  Property),
unless such Tax Indemnitee waives its right to be indemnified under this Section
with respect to such Claim,  provided the settlement  would not adversely affect
material rights or property interests of Lessee, including,  without limitation,
the Lessee's use,  title or possession of the Leased  Property.  Notwithstanding
anything  contained  herein to the contrary,  (i) a Tax  Indemnitee  will not be
required to contest  (and Lessee shall not be permitted to contest) a Claim with
respect to the  imposition  of any Tax if such Tax  Indemnitee  shall  waive its
right to indemnification  under this Section with respect to such Claim (and any
related  Claim  with  respect  to

                                      -34-


<PAGE>

other  taxable  years  the  contest  of which is  precluded  as a result of such
waiver) and (ii) no Tax Indemnitee shall be required to contest any Claim if the
subject matter thereof shall be of a continuing nature and shall have previously
been  decided  adversely,  unless  there  has been a change  in law which in the
opinion of Lessee's  counsel  creates  substantial  authority for the success of
such contest.  Each Tax  Indemnitee  and Lessee shall consult in good faith with
each other regarding the conduct of such contest controlled by either.

              (d)      If (i) a Tax Indemnitee shall obtain a credit or refund
of any Taxes paid by Lessee  pursuant  to this  Section or (ii) by reason of the
incurrence or imposition  of any Tax for which a Tax  Indemnitee is  indemnified
hereunder  or any payment made to or for the account of such Tax  Indemnitee  by
Lessee  pursuant to this  Section,  such Tax  Indemnitee  at any time realizes a
reduction in any Taxes for which the Lessee is not  required to  indemnify  such
Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this Section,  which reduction in Taxes was not taken
into  account in  computing  such payment by the Lessee to or for the account of
such Tax Indemnitee,  then such Tax Indemnitee  shall promptly pay to Lessee the
amount of such  credit  or  refund,  together  with the  amount of any  interest
received by such Tax Indemnitee on account of such credit or refund or an amount
equal to such reduction in Taxes, as the case may be; provided, however, that no
such payment  shall be made so long as an Event of Default  shall have  occurred
and be continuing; and provided,  further, that the amount payable to the Lessee
by any Tax Indemnitee  pursuant to this subsection  shall not at any time exceed
the  aggregate  amount of all  indemnity  payments made by the Lessee under this
Section to such Tax Indemnitee and all related Tax  Indemnitees  with respect to
the Taxes which gave rise to a credit or refund or with respect to the Tax which
gave rise to a reduction in Taxes less the amount of all prior  payments made to
Lessee by such Tax  Indemnitee and related Tax  Indemnitees  under this Section.
Each Tax Indemnitee  agrees to act in good faith to claim such refunds and other
available  Tax  benefits,  and take such other  actions as may be  reasonable to
minimize  any  payment  due from the  Lessee  pursuant  to this  Section  and to
maximize the amount of any Tax savings available to it or them. The disallowance
or reduction of any credit,  refund or other tax savings with respect to which a
Tax Indemnitee has made a payment to the Lessee under this  subsection  shall be
treated  as a Tax for  which the  Lessee  is  obligated  to  indemnify  such Tax
Indemnitee hereunder.

              (e)      Any Tax  indemnifiable  under this Section  shall be paid
directly  when due to the  applicable  taxing  authority  if direct  payment  is
practicable and permitted.  If direct payment to the applicable taxing authority
is  not  permitted  or is  otherwise  not  made,  any  amount  payable  to a Tax
Indemnitee  pursuant to this Section shall be paid within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written demand  therefor from such Tax Indemnitee  accompanied by a
written statement describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable, but not
before the date that the relevant  Taxes are due. Any payments  made pursuant to
this Section shall be made directly to the Tax Indemnitee entitled thereto or to
the Lessee,  as the case may be, in immediately  available funds at such bank or
to such account as specified  by the payee in written  directions  to the payor,
or, if no such direction shall have been given, by check of the payor payable to
the order of the payee by certified mail,  postage prepaid at its Address as set
forth in this  Participation  Agreement.  Upon the request of any Tax Indemnitee
with  respect  to a Tax that the Lessee is  required  to pay,  the Lessee  shall
furnish to such Tax Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of a receipt for
the  Lessee's  payment  of such Tax or such  other  evidence  of  payment  as is
reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee.

                                      -35-



<PAGE>

              (f)      If the Lessee  knows of any  report, return or  statement
required   to  be  filed  with   respect  to  any  Taxes  that  are  subject  to
indemnification under this Section, the Lessee shall, if permitted by Applicable
Law, timely file such report,  return or statement (and, to the extent permitted
by law, show  ownership of the  applicable  Property in the Lessee except to the
extent contrary to financial reporting requirements); provided, however, that if
the Lessee is not  permitted  by  Applicable  Law or does not have access to the
information  required to file any such report,  return or statement,  the Lessee
will  promptly  so notify  the  appropriate  Tax  Indemnitee,  in which case Tax
Indemnitee  will file such report.  In any case in which the Tax Indemnitee will
file any such  report,  return or  statement,  the Lessee  shall,  upon  written
request  of  such  Tax  Indemnitee,   provide  such  Tax  Indemnitee  with  such
information as is reasonably available to the Lessee.

              (g)      At the  Lessee's  request,  the amount  of any  indemnity
payment by the Lessee or any payment by a Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee  pursuant
to this  Section  shall be  verified  and  certified  by an  independent  public
accounting  firm  selected  by  Lessee  and  reasonably  acceptable  to the  Tax
Indemnitee.  Unless such verification  shall disclose an error in Lessee's favor
of 5% or more, the costs of such  verification  shall be borne by Lessee.  In no
event shall Lessee have the right to review the Tax  Indemnitee's tax returns or
receive any other confidential information from the Tax Indemnitee in connection
with  such  verification.  The Tax  Indemnitee  agrees  to  cooperate  with  the
independent  public  accounting firm performing the  verification  and to supply
such firm with all information  reasonably  necessary to permit it to accomplish
such verification; provided, however, that the information provided to such firm
by such Tax Indemnitee shall be for its confidential use. The parties agree that
the sole  responsibility  of the independent  public accounting firm shall be to
verify the amount of a payment pursuant to this Participation Agreement and that
matters of  interpretation  of this  Participation  Agreement are not within the
scope of the independent accounting firm's responsibilities.

         SECTION 7.5   [Reserved]

         SECTION 7.6   END OF TERM INDEMNITY.  In the event that at the end of
the Lease Term (i) Lessor  elects  the option to reject a third  party  offer to
purchase a Property as set forth in SECTION 15.6(xi) of the Lease and (ii) after
Lessor  receives the sales proceeds from the Leased  Property under SECTION 15.6
or 15.7 of the Lease together with Lessee's  payment of the Recourse  Deficiency
Amount,  Lessor shall not have received the entire Lease  Balance,  then Lessor,
the Credit Bank or the  Holders may obtain,  at the sole cost and expense of the
Lessee,  an  appraisal  report from the  Appraiser  (or if the  Appraiser is not
available,  another appraiser reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, the Credit Bank
or the  Holders,  as the  case  may be) in form and  substance  satisfactory  to
Lessor,  the Credit Bank and the Holders to establish the reason for any decline
in value of the  Leased  Property  from  that  anticipated  for such date in the
appraisal  delivered on the Closing Date.  The Lessee shall  promptly  reimburse
Lessor for the  amount  equal to such  decline  in value to the extent  that the
appraisal report  delivered  pursuant to the preceding  sentence  concludes that
such decline was due to (i) extraordinary  use, failure to maintain,  to repair,
to restore,  to rebuild or to replace the Leased Property or any part thereof in
a manner consistent with reasonable preservation of its value, failure to comply
with all Applicable Laws, failure to use, workmanship, method of installation or
removal or maintenance, repair, rebuilding or replacement, or any other cause or
condition within the reasonable power of the Lessee to control or effect, in any
such case resulting in the Improvement failing to be in the same condition as on
the Closing  Date  (excepting  in each case  ordinary  wear and

                                      -36-

tear), (ii) any Alteration made to, or any rebuilding of, the Leased Property or
any part thereof by the Lessee,  (iii) any restoration or rebuilding carried out
by the Lessee or any condemnation of any portion of the Leased Property pursuant
to ARTICLE  XI of the Lease  (after  taking  into  account  any Award in respect
thereof)  or (iv) any use of the  Leased  Property  or any part  thereof  by the
Lessee  other  than as  permitted  pursuant  to ARTICLE  VIII of the Lease.  The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the obligation imposed upon the Lessee
under this Section  arises from a higher  standard of  maintenance of the Leased
Property  than that  required  under  ARTICLE VII of the Lease and is applicable
whether or not the Lessee has failed to comply  with any such other  obligations
under the Operative Documents.

         SECTION 7.7   INCREASED COSTS, ETC.

              (a)      CHANGES;  LEGAL RESTRICTIONS. In the event that after the
date  hereof  (i) the  adoption  of or any  change  in any  law,  treaty,  rule,
regulation,  guideline or determination of a court or Governmental  Authority or
any  change  in  the  interpretation  or  application  thereof  by  a  court  or
Governmental  Authority or (ii) compliance by the Issuer or the Credit Bank with
any  request  or  directive  (whether  or not  having the force of law) from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority:

              (A)      does or will subject the Issuer or the Credit Bank to any
         tax, duty or other charge of any kind which the Credit Bank  determines
         to be  applicable to the Letter of Credit,  any of the other  Operative
         Documents  or  the  Letter  of  Credit   Liabilities  or  the  Borrower
         Promissory  Note or any change in the basis of  taxation of payments to
         the Credit Bank of principal, interest, invested amount, yield, fees or
         any other amount  payable  hereunder or under the Operative  Documents,
         except for taxes  imposed on or  measured  by the overall net income of
         the Issuer or the Credit Bank; or

              (B)      does or will impose,  modify,  or hold applicable, in the
         determination  of the Issuer or the Credit Bank,  any reserve,  special
         deposit,  liquidity  ratio,  compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
         requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in
         or for the account of, advances or loans by, commitments made, or other
         credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, the Issuer or
         the Credit Bank;

and the result of any of the  foregoing is to increase the cost to the Issuer or
the Credit  Bank of making,  renewing or  maintaining  the Loan or the Letter of
Credit or to reduce any amount receivable under the Borrower  Promissory Note or
the Reimbursement  Agreement, and the Issuer or the Credit Bank gives the Lessee
notice of any of the foregoing and the approximate  amount of such cost increase
within  120 days after the  calendar  year in which  such  increased  costs were
incurred by the Issuer or the Credit Bank,  then,  in any such case,  the Lessee
shall  promptly  pay to the Issuer and the Credit  Bank on an  After-Tax  Basis,
within thirty (30) days after demand made in writing by the Issuer or the Credit
Bank to the Lessee,  such amount or amounts (based upon an allocation thereof by
the Issuer or the Credit Bank, as the case may be, to the financing transactions
contemplated  by the Operative  Documents that were so affected by this Section)
as may be reasonably  necessary to compensate  the Issuer or the Credit Bank, as
the case  may be,  for any such  additional  cost  incurred  or  reduced  amount
received.  The Issuer or the Credit Bank,  as the case may be, shall  deliver to
the Lessee a written statement of the costs or reductions  claimed and the basis
therefor,  and the

                                      -37-


<PAGE>

allocation made by the Issuer or the Credit Bank, as the case may be, of such
costs and reductions  shall be conclusive,  absent  demonstrable error.

              (b)      CAPITAL  ADEQUACY.  Subject to the provisions  of SECTION
8.12, if the the Credit Bank shall have determined  that, after the date hereof,
the  adoption  of any  applicable  law,  rule or  regulation  regarding  capital
adequacy,  or any  change  therein,  or any  change  in  the  interpretation  or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration  thereof, or compliance
by the Credit  Bank with any request or  directive  regarding  capital  adequacy
(whether  or not  having the force of law) of any such  Governmental  Authority,
central bank or comparable  agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate  of  return  on the  Credit  Bank's  capital,  as the  case  may  be,  as a
consequence of its obligations under the Letter of Credit, to a level below that
which the Credit  Bank  could have  achieved  but for such  adoption,  change or
compliance (taking into consideration the Credit Bank's policies with respect to
capital adequacy),  then from time to time, within thirty (30) days after demand
made in writing by the Credit  Bank to the Lessee,  the Lessee  shall pay to the
Credit Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Credit Bank
for such  reduction.  The Credit Bank,  upon  determining in good faith that any
additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this subsection, will give prompt
written  notice  thereof to the Lessee  which  notice  shall show in  reasonable
detail the basis for calculation of such additional  amounts.  Such notice shall
be conclusive absent demonstrable error.

         SECTION 7.8   EXCULPATION. Except for the Issuer's obligations to
advance the Loan in accordance with the Operative Documents,  neither the Issuer
nor the Credit Bank has nor shall have any liability or obligation whatsoever or
howsoever in  connection  with the  acquisition,  ownership or management of the
Improvements, and neither the Issuer nor the Credit Bank is obligated to inspect
the  Improvements;  nor is either the Issuer or the Credit Bank liable and under
no  circumstances  whatsoever  shall the Issuer or the Credit  Bank be or become
liable for the performance or default of any contractor or subcontractor, or for
any failure to construct,  complete, protect or insure the Improvements,  or any
part thereof,  or for the payment of any cost or expense  incurred in connection
therewith,  or for the performance or  non-performance  of any obligation of the
Lessor or the Lessee to the Issuer, the Credit Bank or to any other person, firm
or entity without limitation;  and nothing,  including without  limitation,  any
disbursement  of  proceeds  of  the  Loan  or  acceptance  of  any  document  or
instrument,  shall be construed  as a  representation  or  warranty,  express or
implied, on the Issuer's or the Credit Bank's part.

         SECTION 7.9   ROLE OF ISSUER AND THE CREDIT BANK. Any term or condition
hereof  or  of  any  of  the  other   Operative   Documents   to  the   contrary
notwithstanding, neither the Issuer nor the Credit Bank shall have, and by their
respective  execution and  acceptance  of this  Participation  Agreement  hereby
expressly  disclaims,  any  obligation  or  responsibility  for the  management,
conduct or operation of the  Improvements  or business and affairs of the Lessee
and any term or condition  hereof,  or of any of the other Operative  Documents,
permitting  the Issuer or the Credit Bank to disburse  funds,  whether  from the
proceeds of the Loan or otherwise,  or to take or refrain from taking any action
with respect to the Lessee or the Improvements  shall be deemed to be solely for
the benefit of the Issuer and the Credit  Bank,  as the case may be, and may not
be relied upon by any other  person.  Further,  neither the Issuer or the Credit
Bank  shall  have,  neither  of them  has  assumed,

                                      -38-

and  each  of  them  by  their  respective  execution  and  acceptance  of  this
Participation   Agreement   hereby   expressly   disclaims,   any  liability  or
responsibility  for the payment or performance of any indebtedness or obligation
of the Lessee or the Lessor and no term or  condition  hereof,  or of any of the
other Operative Documents, shall be construed otherwise.

precedent to the  obligation of Issuer to make the Loan,  and the  obligation of
the Credit Bank to deliver the Letter of Credit,  are imposed  hereby solely for
the benefit of Issuer and the Credit Bank, respectively. No party other than the
Issuer  and the  Credit  Bank may  require  satisfaction  of any such  condition
precedent.  No other party  (including  the Lessor)  shall be entitled to assume
that Issuer will refuse to advance the proceeds of the Loan,  or that the Credit
Bank will refuse to issue and  deliver  the Letter of Credit,  in the absence of
strict  compliance  with such  conditions  precedent.  Any  requirement  of this
Participation Agreement, and any requirement of the Reimbursement Agreement, may
be waived by the Issuer or the Credit  Bank,  with  respect to the making of the
Loan or the delivery of the Letter of Credit, as the case may be, in whole or in
part, at any time. Any requirement  herein or in any other Operative Document of
submission  of  evidence  to  Issuer  or the  Credit  Bank of the  existence  or
non-existence of a fact or condition shall be deemed,  also, to be a requirement
that the fact or  condition  shall  exist or not exist,  as the case may be, and
without  waiving any condition or  obligation  of the Lessee or the Lessor,  the
Issuer for itself and the Credit Bank for itself, may at all times independently
establish to its respective satisfaction such existence or non-existence.

         SECTION 7.11  LESSOR'S  BENEFITS.  All  conditions  precedent  to  the
obligation of Lessor to invest the  Contribution  are imposed  hereby solely for
the benefit of Lessor.  No party other than the Lessor may require  satisfaction
of any such  condition  precedent.  No party other than the Credit Bank shall be
entitled to direct Lessor to refuse to make any  Contribution  in the absence of
strict  compliance  with such  conditions  precedent.  Any  requirement  of this
Participation Agreement and any requirement of Operative Documents may be waived
by Lessor, in whole or in part, at any time, subject to the Credit Bank's rights
under the Assignment of Lease and Rents and the other Operative  Documents.  Any
requirement  herein or in any other Operative Document of submission of evidence
to Lessor of the existence or non-existence of a fact shall be deemed,  also, to
be a requirement that the fact shall exist or not exist, as the case may be, and
without  waiving any condition or  obligation  of the Lessee,  Lessor may at all
times   independently   establish  to  its   satisfaction   such   existence  or
non-existence.

                                    SECTION 8
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Operative Documents (including, without limitation, the termination of the Lease
pursuant to SECTION 15.7 thereof in connection with the Lessee's  payment of the
Recourse Deficiency  Amount),  and any disposition of any interest of the Lessor
or the  Issuer  in the  Leased  Property  and  shall be and  continue  in effect
thereafter   for  the  period  of  the   applicable   statute   of   limitations
notwithstanding  any  investigation  made by any  party  hereto or to any of the
other Operative  Documents and the fact that any such party may waive compliance
with any of the other terms,  provisions  or  conditions of any of the Operative
Documents.

                  SECTION 2.1  LEASE OF LEASED  PROPERTY.  Subject to the terms,
conditions and provisions of this Lease and the other Operative  Documents,  the
Lessor hereby demises and leases the Lessor's interest in the Leased Property to
the Lessee and the Lessee does hereby  rent and lease the  Lessor's  interest in
the Leased Property from the Lessor, for and during the Lease Term.

                  SECTION 2.4  NATURE OF  TRANSACTION.  It is the intent of the
parties  hereto  that:  (a)  for  financial   accounting   purposes  this  Lease
constitutes an "operating  lease" pursuant to Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 13, as amended;  (b) for  purposes of  commercial,  real  estate,
bankruptcy  and  federal,  state  and  local  income  tax law,  the  transaction
contemplated  by this Lease is a financing  arrangement  and shall be treated as
the repayment and security provisions of a loan by the Lessor to the Lessee, and
that all  payments  of Basic  Rent  during  the Lease  Term  shall be treated as
payments of interest and principal, as the case may be, in respect of such loan;
(c) if a bankruptcy court or other court of competent  jurisdiction shall at any
time  determine  that the  transactions  represented by this Lease and the other
Operative  Documents do not constitute a true leasing  transaction,  then in any
such  event,  this  Lease  shall  be  treated  as a deed of trust  and  security
agreement,  a  mortgage  and  security  agreement  or other  similar  instrument
granting a lien and security interest,  with a power of sale from the Lessee, as
mortgagor or grantor,  to the Lessor as mortgagee  or grantee,  encumbering  the
Leased  Property,  to secure the Lessee's  performance  under and payment of all
amounts  at any time due or payable  under  this  Lease and the other  Operative
Documents,  and the  payment  by the  Lessee of Basic  Rent  shall be treated as
payments of interest  and the payment by the Lessee of any amounts in respect of
the Lease Balance shall be treated as repayments of principal (all such payments
being obligatory and to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall have priority
over any and all mechanics' liens and other liens and encumbrances arising after
each Memorandum of Lease is recorded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the maximum amount
of  unpaid   indebtedness   secured  hereby,   exclusive  of  interest  and  the
Distributions, which may be outstanding at any time shall be $29,250,515 and (d)
the Mortgages and the Assignment of Lease and Rents shall and hereby do create a

as the Lessor and the Lessee shall from time to time mutually agree upon. In the
event of any  failure  on the part of the Lessee to pay any  Supplemental  Rent,
which failure constitutes an Event of Default, the Lessor shall have all rights,
powers and  remedies  provided for herein or by law or in equity or otherwise in
the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. All Supplemental  Rent to be paid pursuant
to this  Section  shall be  payable  in the type of funds and in the  manner set
forth in SECTION 4.3 hereof. Without limitation of the foregoing in any respect,

Lessee  directly to the Credit Bank,  which shall in turn apply such amounts (i)
to  reimburse  amounts  due  under  the  Reimbursement  Agreement  for  Drawings
previously  made, or to be made on the next  Business  Day,  under the Letter of
Credit,  and (ii) on behalf of the Lessor in respect of Distributions  then due,
to the extent of such payment of Basic Rent. All  Supplemental  Rent  (including
amounts due under ARTICLE XV hereof)  payable to the Lessor  (excluding  amounts
payable  with  respect to the  Excluded  Rights,  which  shall be payable to the
Lessor or such other  recipient as  appropriate)  shall be payable by the Lessee
directly to the Credit Bank,  which  shall,  so long as no Loan Event of Default
shall have occurred and remain outstanding, pay such amounts to the order of the
Lessor.  All Supplemental Rent payable to Persons other than the Lessor shall be
paid to such Person as may be entitled  thereto or, in each case, to such Person
as the Lessor (or such other Person) shall specify in writing to the Lessee, and
at such place as the Lessor (or such other  Person)  shall specify in writing to
the Lessee,  which  specifications by the Lessor shall be given by the Lessor at
least ten  Business  Days prior to the due date  therefor.  Each payment of Rent
(including  all payments  under  ARTICLE XV hereof)  shall be made by the Lessee
prior to 10:00 a.m. Columbus, Ohio time on the date due, at the place of payment
in funds  consisting  of lawful  currency of the United  States of America which

payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.

         SECTION 4.4   LATE PAYMENT. If any Rent (other than  Supplemental  Rent
payable by reason of this  SECTION  4.4) shall not be paid when due,  the Lessee
shall pay to the Lessor, as Supplemental  Rent,  interest (to the maximum extent
permitted by law) on such overdue amount from and including the due date thereof
to but excluding the Business Day of payment thereof at the Overdue Rate.

notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this Lease,  the Lessee  shall pay all
Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent, and all costs, charges, taxes, assessments and
other expenses  (foreseen or unforeseen)  for which the

for any reason,  including  without  limitation (i) any defect in the condition,
merchantability,  design,  quality or fitness for use of the Leased  Property or

any other Person,  or any action taken with respect to this Lease by any trustee

court,  in any such  proceeding,  (vii) any failure on the part of the Lessor to
perform  or comply  with any of the  terms of this  Lease,  any other  Operative
Document or of any other agreement where such failure was caused by the Lessee's
failure to perform its  obligations  under the Operative  Documents,  (viii) any
disaffirmance  of  this  Lease  or any  provision  hereof  or  any of the  other
Operative  Documents  or any  provision  of any thereof by the Lessee,  (ix) any

forth in ARTICLES XI and XV hereof,  this Lease shall be  noncancellable  by the
Lessee for any reason  whatsoever  and the Lessee,  to the extent  permitted  by
Applicable  Law,  waives  all rights now or  hereafter  conferred  by statute or
otherwise  to quit,  terminate or surrender  this Lease,  or to any  diminution,
abatement  or  reduction  of Rent  payable by the Lessee  hereunder.  The Lessee
assumes the sole responsibility for the condition, use, operation,  maintenance,
and   management   of  the  Leased   Property  and  the  Lessor  shall  have  no
responsibility  in respect thereof and shall have no liability for damage to the
property of the Lessee or any  subtenant of the Lessee on any account or for any
reason  whatsoever  other than by reason of the Lessor's  willful  misconduct or
breach of any of its express obligations under any Operative Document.

         SECTION 4.6   LESSEE TO COOPERATE  WITH LESSOR.  The Lessee hereby
agrees to use its best  efforts to supply the Lessor  with all such  information
necessary in order for the Lessor to maintain its books and accounts and prepare
all required federal, state and local tax returns.

                          CONDITION AND USE OF PROPERTY

         During the Lease Term, the Lessor's  interest in the Leased Property is
demised  and let by the Lessor "AS IS" subject to (i) the rights of any parties
in possession thereof,  (ii) the state of the title thereto existing at the time
the Lessor  acquired  its  interest in the Leased  Property,  (iii) any state of
facts  which an  accurate  survey or physical  inspection  might show,  (iv) all
Applicable  Law and (v) any violations of Applicable Law which may exist upon or
subsequent to the commencement of the Lease Term. THE LESSEE  ACKNOWLEDGES THAT,
ALTHOUGH THE LESSOR WILL OWN AND HOLD TITLE TO THE LEASED  PROPERTY,  THE LESSEE
IS SOLELY  RESPONSIBLE  FOR THE  CONDITION AND USE OF THE  IMPROVEMENTS  AND ANY
ALTERATIONS.  NEITHER  THE  LESSOR  NOR ANY  OTHER  PARTY  TO THE  PARTICIPATION
AGREEMENT  HAS MADE OR SHALL  BE  DEEMED  TO HAVE  MADE  ANY  REPRESENTATION  OR
WARRANTY,  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,  OR  SHALL  BE  DEEMED  TO HAVE  ANY  LIABILITY
WHATSOEVER AS TO THE VALUE,  MERCHANTABILITY,  TITLE,  HABITABILITY,  CONDITION,

THEREOF),  OR ANY  OTHER  REPRESENTATION  OR  WARRANTY  WHATSOEVER,  EXPRESS  OR
IMPLIED,  WITH RESPECT TO THE LEASED  PROPERTY (OR ANY PART  THEREOF),  ALL SUCH
WARRANTIES BEING HEREBY DISCLAIMED,  AND NEITHER THE LESSOR NOR ANY PARTY TO THE
PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LATENT, HIDDEN, OR PATENT DEFECT
THEREIN OR THE FAILURE OF THE LEASED  PROPERTY,  OR ANY PART THEREOF,  TO COMPLY
WITH ANY  APPLICABLE  LAW except that the Lessor hereby  represents and warrants
that the Leased  Property is and shall at all times remain free of Lessor Liens.
As between  the  Lessor  and the  Lessee,  the  Lessee  has been  afforded  full
opportunity to inspect the Leased Property, is satisfied with the results of its
inspections of the Leased Property and is entering into this Lease solely on the
basis of the  results  of its own  inspections  and all  risks  incident  to the
matters  discussed in the two preceding  sentences,  as between the Lessor,  the
Issuer or the Credit Bank, on the one hand, and the Lessee, on the other, are to
be borne by the Lessee.  The  provisions of this ARTICLE V have been  negotiated
and, except to the extent otherwise  expressly stated, the foregoing  provisions
are intended to be a complete  exclusion and negation of any  representations or
warranties by the Lessor,  the Issuer,  or the Credit Bank,  express or implied,
with respect to the Leased  Property  that may arise  pursuant to any law now or
hereafter in effect or otherwise.

                      LIENS; EASEMENTS; PARTIAL CONVEYANCES

         Commencing on the Closing Date and  thereafter,  neither the Lessee nor
the Lessor shall directly or indirectly create,  incur or assume, any Lien on or
with respect to the Leased  Property,  title  thereto,  or any interest  therein
including  any  Liens  which  arise  out  of  the  possession,  use,  occupancy,
construction,  repair or rebuilding of the Leased Property or by reason of labor
or materials  furnished or claimed to have been furnished to the Lessee,  or any
of its  contractors or agents or by reason of the financing of any personalty or
equipment  purchased or leased by the Lessee or  Alterations  constructed by the
Lessee, except in all cases Permitted Liens.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph,  at the request of the Lessee,
the Lessor  shall,  from time to time during the Lease Term and upon  reasonable
advance written notice from the Lessee and receipt of the materials specified in
the next succeeding sentence, consent to and join in any (i) grant of easements,
licenses, rights of way and other rights in the nature of easements,  including,
without   limitation,   utility   easements  to  facilitate  the  Lessee's  use,
development and construction of the Leased Property, (ii) release or termination
of easements, licenses, rights of way or other rights in the nature of easements
which are for the benefit of the or any portion  thereof,  (iii)  dedication  or
transfer  of portions of the Parcel,  not  improved  with a building,  for road,
highway or other public  purposes,  (iv) execution of agreements for ingress and
egress and  amendments to any covenants  and  restrictions  affecting the Leased
Property or any portion  thereof and (v) request to any  Governmental  Authority
for platting or subdivision or replatting or resubdivision approval with respect
to the Parcel or any portion thereof or any parcel of Parcel of which the parcel
of land of which the Parcel or any portion thereof forms a part or a request for
any  variance  from  zoning or other  governmental  requirements.  The  Lessor's
obligations  pursuant  to  the  preceding  sentence  shall  be  subject  to  the
requirements that:

                  (i)   any such action shall be at the sole cost and expense of
the Lessee and the Lessee shall pay all reasonable and documented  out-of-pocket
costs of the Lessor in connection therewith (including,  without limitation, the
reasonable and documented fees of attorneys,  architects,  engineers,  planners,
appraisers  and  other  professionals  reasonably  retained  by  the  Lessor  in
connection with any such action);

                  (ii)  The  Lessee  shall  have  delivered  to  the  Lessor  an
Officer's  Certificate  stating  that (1) such  action will not cause the Leased
Property or any portion  thereof to fail to comply in any material  respect with
the provisions of this Lease or any other Operative  Document or in any material
respect with  Applicable Law and (2) such action will not materially  reduce the
Fair Market Sales Value,  utility or useful life of the Leased  Property nor the
Lessor's interest therein; and

                  (iii) in the case of any release or conveyance,  if the Lessor
so requests and to the extent available  without undue expense,  the Lessee will
cause to be issued  and  delivered  to the  Credit  Bank by the Title  Insurance
Company an endorsement to the Title Policy pursuant to which the Title Insurance
Company  agrees that its  liability  for the payment of any loss or damage under
the terms and  provisions  of the Title Policy will not be affected by reason of
the fact that a portion of the real  property  referred  to in Schedule A of the
Title Policy has been released or conveyed by the Lessor.

         done in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable
         building and zoning laws and with all other Applicable Law; the cost of

in  SECTION  9.1 (c)  hereof  shall  name  the  Credit  Bank  as the  loss-payee
thereunder.  Upon the receipt of same,  the Credit Bank shall apply the proceeds
of such rental value insurance paid to it first to the payment of Basic Rent and
then to the payment of taxes, insurance premiums and other items of Supplemental
Rent becoming due during the rebuilding and restoration of the Leased  Property,
and any balance of such proceeds  after the  completion of such  rebuilding  and
restoration  shall  be paid to the  Lessee.  Except  as  provided  above in this
SECTION 9.4, all  policies of  insurance  required  herein shall name the Credit
Bank, the Lessor,  and the Lessee as the insureds as their respective  interests
may appear.  Subject to the provisions and  limitations of this SECTION 9.4, all
policies referred to in SECTION 9.1 hereof shall also provide for any loss to be
payable to the Credit Bank as its  interest  may appear,  pursuant to a standard
mortgagee clause or endorsement.  The loss, if any, under the policies  referred
to in SECTION 9.1 hereof shall be adjusted with the  insurance  companies by the
Lessee except that no loss exceeding  $1,000,000  shall be adjusted  without the
prior  written  approval  of  the  Credit  Bank,  which  approval  shall  not be
unreasonably  conditioned,  withheld or delayed, except that so long as an Event
of Default is outstanding,  all such losses shall be adjusted exclusively by the
Credit Bank.  The loss,  if any,  under all policies  referred to in SECTION 9.1
hereof  shall be payable  to the  Credit  Bank,  which  shall make the  proceeds
thereof available to the Lessee in the circumstances  provided by the provisions
of SECTION 11.6 hereof.  All such  policies  shall  expressly  provide that loss
thereunder  shall be adjusted and paid as provided in this SECTION 9.4. Any loss
paid to the Lessee under any insurance  policy referred to in SECTION 9.1 hereof
shall be held by the Lessee in trust for  application  to the cost of restoring,
repairing,  replacing or rebuilding  the Leased  Property.  Any loss paid to the
Credit Bank shall be held in trust by it and disbursed by it in accordance  with
the provisions of SECTION 11.6 hereof.

         SECTION 9.5  OTHER  INSURANCE. Nothing in this ARTICLE IX shall prevent
the Lessee from taking out insurance of the kind and in the amounts provided for
under  SECTION 9.1 and 9.2 hereof under a blanket  insurance  policy or policies
which can cover other  properties owned or operated by the Lessee as well as the
Leased Property;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that any such policy of insurance provided
for under  SECTION 9.1 hereof  shall (a) specify  therein,  or the Lessee  shall
furnish  the  Lessor  and the  Credit  Bank  with a written  statement  from the
insurers  under such  policies  specifying,  the  amount of the total  insurance
allocated to the Leased Property, which amount shall be not less than the amount
required by said SECTION 9.1 to be carried, and (b) not contain any clause which
would result in the insured  thereunder  being required to carry  insurance with
respect to the property covered thereby in an amount equal to a minimum specific
percentage of the value of such property in order to prevent the insured therein
named from becoming a co-insurer of any loss with the insurer under such policy.
The Lessee shall furnish to the Lessor and the Credit Bank, within 30 days after
the filing thereof with any insurance  rate-making  body, copies of the schedule
or make-up of all property covered by every such policy of blanket insurance.

         SECTION 9.6  LOSS DEDUCTIBLES.  All  insurance  provided for under this
Lease may  contain  loss  deductible  clauses  in such  commercially  reasonable
maximum amounts as the Credit Bank shall approve from time to time.

         SECTION 9.7  FAILURE TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE. If the Lessee shall fail to
maintain  any  insurance  required  to be  maintained  herein  or in  any  other
Operative  Document,  then without

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
limiting the application of the provisions of ARTICLE XIII(c) hereof, the Lessor
or the Credit Bank may, but shall not be required to,  obtain such  insurance on
behalf of the Lessee.  In the event the Lessor or the Credit  Bank shall  obtain
such  insurance,  (a) the Lessee shall pay the costs of obtaining such insurance
as Supplemental  Rent within five (5) Business Days of demand therefor,  and (b)
the Lessee may provide other  insurance  conforming to the  requirements of this
Lease, in which instance any insurance obtained by the Credit Bank or the Lessor
shall be  cancelled at the  Lessee's  request.  The rights of the Lessor and the
Credit Bank under this SECTION 9.7 shall be in addition to, and not in place of,
any other rights such parties may have under this Lease and the other  Operative
Documents.

                                    ARTICLE X
                            ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASING

         Except as provided in the next following  sentence,  the Lessee may not
assign any of its right,  title or  interest  in, to or under  this  Lease.  The
Lessee  may  assign or  sublease  all or any  portion  of the  Leased  Property;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that (i) all obligations of the Lessee (or, in the case of a
merger,  consolidation  or  sale  of all or  substantially  all of the  Lessee's
assets,  the Lessee's successor PROVIDED THAT (A) such successor has a Net Worth
at least  equal to that of the  Lessee as of the end of the most  recent  fiscal
quarter of the Lessee, (B) such successor assumes in writing all of the Lessee's
obligations under the Operative  Documents without  qualification or reservation
and (C) immediately  after giving effect to such merger,  consolidation or sale,
no Event of Default  exists) shall  continue in full effect as  obligations of a
principal and not of a guarantor or surety,  as though no assignment or sublease
had been made, (ii) any such sublease shall be expressly subject and subordinate
to this  Lease,  the  Reimbursement  Agreement,  the  Mortgages  and  the  other
Operative  Documents except to the extent this Lease remains effective under the
Non-Disturbance  and  Attornment  Agreement and (iii) each such  sublease  shall
terminate on or before the Lease Termination Date.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                    LOSS, DESTRUCTION, CONDEMNATION OR DAMAGE

         SECTION 11.1 EVENT OF LOSS.  Any  event  (i)  which  would   otherwise
constitute  a Casualty  during the Lease  Term,  (ii) which,  in the  good-faith
judgment of the Lessee,  renders repair and  restoration of any Leased  Property
impractical or uneconomical and (iii) as to which the Lessee, within thirty (30)
days after the  occurrence of such event,  delivers to the Lessor and the Issuer
an Officer's  Certificate  notifying the Lessor and the Issuer of such event and
of such judgment,  shall constitute an "Event of Loss". In the case of any other
event which  constitutes  a Casualty,  the Lessee shall  restore and rebuild the
affected  Leased Property  pursuant to SECTION 11.3 hereof.  If an Event of Loss
other than an Event of Taking shall occur, the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on
the  next  Facility  Rent  Payment  Date  following  delivery  of the  Officer's
Certificate  pursuant to CLAUSE (iii) of the preceding sentence,  in addition to
all Basic Rent and  Supplement  Rent otherwise due on such date, an amount equal
to the Lease Balance applicable to the Leased Property as of such date. Upon the
Lessor's  receipt of such Lease Balance on such date, the Lessor shall cause the
Lessor's  interest  in the  Leased  Property  to be  conveyed  to the  Lessee in
accordance  with and  subject  to the  provisions  of  SECTION  15.5  ("Purchase
Procedure")  hereof,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that  (A) such

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
conveyance may be by special warranty deed, but free and clear of Lessor's Liens
and the lien of the related Mortgage, (B) the Lessor shall have no obligation to
remove  title  defects  other  than  Lessor  Liens  and the lien of the  related
Mortgage affecting such Leased Property and (C) the Lessee's ability to obtain a
title insurance policy shall not affect the Lessee's  obligation to purchase the
Lessor's  interest in the affected  Leased  Property.  Upon  completion  of such
purchase,  but not prior thereto,  the affected  Leased Property shall be deemed
released from this Lease and all  obligations  of the Lessee and the Lessor with
respect to such  Leased  Property  (including  the  obligation  to make  further
payments of Basic Rent) shall terminate,  except with respect to obligations and
liabilities  hereunder,  actual or  contingent,  that  have  arisen or relate to
events  occurring on or prior to such date of purchase,  or which are  expressly
stated herein to survive termination of this Lease. Upon the consummation of the
purchase of the affected  Leased  Property  pursuant to this SECTION  11.1,  any
proceeds derived from insurance required to be maintained by the Lessee pursuant
to this Lease for Leased Property remaining after payment of such purchase price
shall be paid over to, or retained  by, the Lessee or as it may direct,  and the
Lessor shall assign to the Lessee,  without warranty, all of the Lessor's rights
to and interest in insurance required to be maintained by the Lessee pursuant to
this Lease.

         SECTION 11.2 EVENT OF TAKING.  Any event (a) which constitutes a taking
of title to any Leased  Property or (b) (i) which would  otherwise  constitute a
Condemnation,  (ii) which,  in the  good-faith  judgment of the Lessee,  renders
restoration  and rebuilding of such Leased Property  impossible,  impractical or
uneconomical and (iii) as to which the Lessee, within thirty (30) days after the
occurrence  of such event,  delivers  to the Lessor and the Issuer an  Officer's
Certificate  notifying the Lessor and the Issuer of such event, of such judgment
and of the date (or the  Lessee's  best  estimate  thereof)  on which the Lessee
shall be required to relinquish  possession of the affected  Leased Property (or
the affected portion  thereof),  shall  constitute an "Event of Taking".  In the
case of any other event  which  constitutes  a  Condemnation,  the Lessee  shall
restore  and rebuild  the  affected  Leased  Property  pursuant to SECTION  11.4
hereof.  If an Event of Taking shall  occur,  the Lessee shall pay to the Issuer
for the  account  of the  Lessor  (i) on the next  Facility  Rent  Payment  Date
following  the  occurrence  of such Event of Taking,  in the case of an Event of
Taking described in clause (a) of the second  preceding  sentence or (ii) on the
Facility  Rent  Payment  Date next  preceding  the date on which  the  Lessee is
required  to  relinquish  possession  of the Leased  Property  (or the  affected
portion  thereof),  in the case of an Event of Taking described in CLAUSE (b) of
the second  preceding  sentence,  in addition to all Basic Rent and Supplemental
Rent otherwise due on such date, an amount equal to the Lease Balance applicable
to the Leased  Property.  Upon the Issuer's receipt of such amount on such date,
the Lessor shall cause the Lessor's  interest in the affected Leased Property to
be conveyed to the Lessee in  accordance  with and subject to the  provisions of
SECTION 15.5 ("Purchase  Procedure") hereof;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that (A) such
conveyance may be by special warranty deed, but free and clear of Lessor's Liens
and the lien of the related  Mortgage,  (B) such conveyance  shall be subject to
all rights of the condemning authority,  (C) the Lessor shall have no obligation
to remove  title  defects  other than  Lessor  Liens and the lien of the related
Mortgage affecting such Leased Property and (D) the Lessee's ability to obtain a
title insurance policy shall not affect the Lessee's  obligation to purchase the
Lessor's  interest in the affected  Leased  Property.  Upon  completion  of such
purchase,  but not prior thereto,  the affected  Leased Property shall be deemed
released from this Lease and all  obligations of the Lessee and the Lessor under
this Lease with respect to such Leased  Property  (including  the  obligation to
make  further  payments of Basic Rent) shall  terminate,  except with respect to
obligations and liabilities

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
hereunder,  actual or contingent, that have arisen or relate to events occurring
on or prior to the date of such purchase,  or which are expressly  stated herein
to survive  termination of this Lease.  Upon the consummation of the purchase of
the affected Leased Property  pursuant to this SECTION 11.2, all Awards received
by the Lessor,  after deducting any reasonable and documented  costs incurred by
the Lessor in collecting such Awards, received or payable on account of an Event
of Taking  during the Lease Term shall be paid to the Lessee,  and all rights of
the Lessor in Awards not then  received  shall be  assigned to the Lessee by the
Lessor.  If no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing,  the Lessee
shall have the right to negotiate with the condemning  authority and receive all
Awards, subject to the terms of this Lease.

         SECTION 11.3 CASUALTY.  If a Casualty  shall  occur,  the Lessee shall
rebuild and restore the affected Leased  Property,  will complete the same prior
to the Lease  Termination Date (provided that sufficient time to do so exists at
the time  such  Casualty  occurs)  and will  cause the  conditions  set forth in
SECTION 3.3 of the Participation  Agreement to be fulfilled with respect to such
restoration  and  rebuilding  prior to the  Lease  Termination  Date;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that  such  restoration  and  rebuilding  will be  performed,  and the
Improvements,  as applicable,  will be restored and rebuilt,  in accordance with
the  Plans  and  Specifications  as in  existence  on  the  date  on  which  the
certificate of occupancy for the affected Improvements was issued, as such Plans
and  Specifications  may have been modified in respect of Alterations  completed
prior to the  occurrence of such Casualty  pursuant to SECTION 7.2 hereof,  with
such additional  modifications  to such Plans and  Specifications  as the Lessor
shall consent to in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

         SECTION 11.4 CONDEMNATION.  If a Condemnation  shall occur, the Lessee
shall  rebuild  and  restore  the  affected   Leased   Property  to  the  extent
practicable,  will  complete  the  same  prior  to the  Lease  Termination  Date
(provided  that  sufficient  time to do so exists at the time such  Condemnation
occurs),  and  will  cause  the  conditions  set  forth  in  SECTION  3.3 of the
Participation  Agreement to be fulfilled  with respect to such  restoration  and
rebuilding prior to the Lease Termination Date; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that within
sixty (60) days after the  Lessee's  receipt of any Awards with  respect to such
Condemnation,  the  Lessee  shall  pay to the  Issuer,  for  application  to the
prepayment of the Borrower Promissory Note (and in turn paid to the Note Trustee
for payment of the Notes in accordance with the Note Indenture, (a) the portion,
if any,  of such  Awards  which  are  identified,  by the  condemner,  as  being
allocable  to the  Parcel  or (b)  if no  such  identification  is  made  by the
condemner, the portion, if any, of such Awards which are, in Lessee's good-faith
and reasonable judgment,  allocable to the Parcel; and provided,  further,  that
such  restoration and rebuilding  will be performed,  and the  Improvements,  as
applicable,  will be restored  and  rebuilt,  in  accordance  with the Plans and
Specifications as in existence on the date on which the certificate of occupancy
for the affected  Improvements,  as  applicable,  was issued,  as such Plans and
Specifications may have been modified in respect of Alterations  completed prior
to the  occurrence  of such  Condemnation  pursuant  to  SECTION  7.2  hereof or
modified  to adjust for a Casualty  of the Leased  Property  pursuant to SECTION
11.3 hereof, with such additional modifications to such Plans and Specifications
as  the  Lessor  shall  consent  to in  writing,  which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         SECTION 11.5 VERIFICATION OF RESTORATION  AND  REBUILDING.  The Lessee
will  promptly  notify  the  Issuer,  the Note  Trustee  and the  Lessor  of the
completion of the restoration or rebuilding of the Improvements,  as applicable,
after a Casualty or  Condemnation.  After  completion  of such

the  foregoing  SECTIONS  11.3 and 11.4,  the  Lessor  and the  Issuer and their
authorized  representatives  may, at their own risk and upon three (3)  Business
Days' notice to the Lessee,  inspect the Leased  Property and the  completion of
the  restoration  and  rebuilding  of  the  Improvements,   as  applicable.  All
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of such inspection incurred by the
Lessor and the Credit  Bank will be paid by the Lessee  promptly  after  written
request.  No such  inspection  shall  unreasonably  interfere  with the Lessee's
operations or the operations of any other occupant of the Leased Property.  None
of the  inspecting  parties  shall have any duty to make any such  inspection or
inquiry  and  none of the  inspecting  parties  shall  incur  any  liability  or
obligation by reason of not making any such  inspection or inquiry.  None of the
inspecting  parties  shall incur any liability or obligation by reason of making
any such  inspection or inquiry unless and to the extent such  inspecting  party
causes damage to the Leased  Property or any property of the Lessee or any other
Person during the course of such inspection, whereupon, provided that the Lessee
shall not have been negligent or acted intentionally or with gross recklessness,
such inspecting  party shall be liable for any such damage or injury,  as may be
applicable,  shall  indemnify and hold the Lessee  harmless from and against all
claims, losses and liability as to such damage or injury.

         SECTION  11.6  APPLICATION  OF PAYMENTS.  (a) All proceeds  (except for
payments under insurance  policies  maintained other than pursuant to ARTICLE IX
of this Lease) received at any time by the Lessor, the Lessee or the Issuer from
any  Governmental  Authority or other Person with respect to any Condemnation or
Casualty to the Leased  Property or any part thereof or with respect to an Event
of Loss or an Event of Taking,  plus the amount of any  payment  that would have
been due from an insurer but for Lessee's  self-insurance or deductibles  ("LOSS
PROCEEDS"),  shall (except to the extent SECTION 11.9 hereof applies) be applied
as follows:

                  (i)   In the event  the  Lessee purchase the  affected  Leased
         Property  pursuant to SECTION 11.1 or SECTION  11.2  hereof,  such Loss
         Proceeds  shall be applied as set forth in such SECTION 11.1 or SECTION
         11.2, as the case may be;

                  (ii)  In the event of a Casualty at such time when an Event of
         Default has occurred and is  continuing  and the Lessee is obligated to
         repair and rebuild the Leased Property pursuant to SECTION 11.3 hereof,
         the  Lessee  may,  in good  faith  and  subsequent  to the date of such
         Casualty,  certify to the Issuer and to the applicable  insurer that no
         Default or Event of Default has occurred, in which event the applicable
         insurer  shall pay the Loss Proceeds to the Lessee and, if requested by
         the Lessee, the Credit Bank and the Lessor shall so direct the insurer;

                  (iii) In the  event of a  Condemnation  at such  time  when an
         Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing  and the Lessee is
         obligated to repair and rebuild the Leased Property pursuant to SECTION
         11.4 hereof,  the Lessor and the Credit Bank (if  required)  shall upon
         the Lessee's  request  assign to the Lessee the Lessor's and the Credit
         Bank's (if  applicable)  interest in any  applicable  Awards except for
         Awards  (or  portions  thereof)  described  in  SECTION  11.4(a) or (b)
         hereof; and

                  (iv)  As provided in SECTION 11.8 hereof if such Section is
         applicable.

<PAGE>
                  (b)  During any period of repair or rebuilding  pursuant to
this  ARTICLE XI, this Lease will remain in full force and effect and Basic Rent
shall  continue to accrue and be payable  without  abatement or  reduction.  The
Lessee shall maintain records setting forth information  relating to the receipt
and  application of payments in accordance  with this SECTION 11.6. Such records
shall be kept on file by the Lessee at its offices  and shall be made  available
to the Lessor and the Credit Bank upon request.

         SECTION 11.7 PROSECUTION  OF AWARDS (a) If, during the  continuance of
any Event of Default, any Condemnation shall occur, the Lessee shall give to the
Lessor and the Credit Bank  promptly,  but in any event  within  sixty (60) days
after the occurrence of such Condemnation, written notice of such occurrence and
the  date  thereof,   generally   describing  the  nature  and  extent  of  such
Condemnation.  With  respect  to any Event of Taking  or any  Condemnation,  the
Lessee shall control the negotiations with the relevant  Governmental  Authority
as to any proceeding in respect of which Awards are required, under SECTION 11.6
hereof, to be assigned or released to the Lessee; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing  the Lessor shall control
such negotiations.  The Lessee hereby irrevocably assign,  transfer and set over
to the Lessor all rights of the Lessee to any Award made during the  continuance
of an Event of Default  on  account  of any Event of Taking or any  Condemnation
and,  if there  will not be  separate  Awards to the  Lessor  and the  Lessee on
account  of such Event of Taking or  Condemnation,  irrevocably  authorizes  and
empowers the Lessor  during the  continuance  of an Event of Default,  with full
power of  substitution  in the name of the  Lessee  or  otherwise  (but  without
limiting  the  obligations  of the Lessee  under this  ARTICLE  XI), to file and
prosecute what would  otherwise be the Lessee's claim for any such Award and, in
the case of the Lessor, to collect,  receipt for and retain the same;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that in any event the Lessor may participate in any such negotiations,
and no settlement  will be made without the Lessor's  prior  consent,  not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Lessee may prosecute,
and the Lessor shall have no interest in, any claim with respect to the Lessee's
trade  fixtures,   other  personal  property  and  equipment  and  the  Lessee's
relocation expenses.

         SECTION 11.8 APPLICATION OF CERTAIN  PAYMENTS NOT RELATING TO AN EVENT
OF TAKING. In case of a requisition for temporary use of all or a portion of the
Leased Property which is not an Event of Taking, this Lease shall remain in full
force and effect,  without any  abatement or  reduction  of Basic Rent,  and the
Awards for the Leased  Property  shall,  unless an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, be paid to the Lessee.

         SECTION 11.9 OTHER   DISPOSITIONS.   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing
provisions  of this  ARTICLE  XI,  so long as an Event  of  Default  shall  have
occurred and be continuing, any amount that would otherwise be payable to or for
the account of, or that would  otherwise be retained by, the Lessee  pursuant to
this ARTICLE XI shall be paid to the Lessor as security for the  obligations  of
the Lessee under this Lease and, at such time  thereafter as no Event of Default
shall be  continuing,  such amount  shall be paid  promptly to the Lessee to the
extent not previously applied by the Lessor in accordance with the terms of this
Lease or the other Operative Documents.

         SECTION 11.10 NO RENT  ABATEMENT.  Rent shall not abate  hereunder  by
reason  of any  Casualty,  any  Event  of  Loss,  any  Event  of  Taking  or any
Condemnation  of the Leased  Property,  and the Lessee shall continue to perform
and fulfill all of the Lessee's obligations,  covenants and agreements hereunder
notwithstanding  such Casualty,  Event of Loss,  Event of Taking or Condemnation
until the Lease Termination Date. The foregoing  notwithstanding,  if and to the
extent that,  pursuant to the  provisions of this Lease and the other  Operative
Documents,  Loss Proceeds or Awards are paid over to and permanently retained by
the  Issuer  or the  Lessor,  Lessee  shall  receive  as a  credit  against  its
obligation to pay Basic Rent or, as applicable, the Lease Balance, in the amount
of any such Loss Proceeds or Awards.

shall be treated as payments of interest on and  principal of,  respectively,  a
loan from the Lessor to the Lessee,  and (ii) this Lease shall be deemed to, and
does, constitute, INTER-ALIA, a mortgage and security agreement, a deed of trust
and security agreement,  or other similar  instrument,  as more particularly set
forth in the Memorandum of Lease for each Property, respectively, to be executed
by the Lessor and the Lessee  simultaneously  herewith and to be recorded in the

estate,  right title and interest in and to the  portions of each such  Property
which  constitute  interests in real  property,  including all right,  title and
interest of the Lessee in and to the fee title to, and reversionary interest in,
each such Property,  and a leasehold  mortgage on the Lessee's  leasehold estate
under

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

this  Lease,  and a  security  interest  and lien on the  portions  of each such
Property which do not constitute interests in real property, and all proceeds of
the conversion,  voluntary or  involuntary,  of any or all of the foregoing into
cash,  investments,  securities  or other  property,  to have  and to hold  such
interests in each such  Property unto the Lessor,  as mortgagee,  or the trustee
named in such deed of trust for the benefit of the  Lessor,  as the case may be,
and their respective  successors and assigns,  forever, it being agreed that the
provisions  set forth in each  such  Memorandum  of Lease  hereby  are  entirely
incorporated by reference with respect to each such Property with the same force
and effect as if set forth at length herein.

                  (c)  Specifically,   without   limiting  the   generality  of
SUBSECTION  (b) of this ARTICLE XII, the Lessor and the Lessee  intend and agree
that with respect to the nature of the  transactions  evidenced by this Lease in
the  context  of  the  exercise  of  remedies  under  the  Operative  Documents,
including,  without  limitation,  in the case of any insolvency or  receivership
proceedings or a petition under the United States  bankruptcy  laws or any other
applicable  insolvency  laws or statute  of the United  States of America or any
State or  Commonwealth  thereof  affecting  the  Lessee and the  Lessor,  or any
enforcement or collection actions, the transaction  evidenced by this Lease is a
loan made by the  Lessor  as an  unrelated  third  party  lender to the  Lessee,
secured by the Leased  Property,  (it being  understood  that the Lessee  hereby
mortgages,  grants,  bargains,  sells,  releases,  confirms,  conveys,  assigns,
transfers and sets over to the trustee or  mortgagee,  as the case may be, named
in the applicable  Memorandum of Lease for each Property,  and grants a security
interest in, the Leased  Property  (consisting of a fee mortgage with respect to
all  right,  title and  interest  of the  Lessee in and to the fee title to, and
reversionary  interest in, the Leased Property) and a leasehold  mortgage on the
Lessee's leasehold estate under this Lease, all to secure such loans,  effective
on the date hereof,  to have and to hold such  interests in the Leased  Property
unto the Lessor and its successors and assigns,  forever,  provided  always that
these  presents are upon the express  condition  that,  if all amounts due under
this Lease shall have been paid and satisfied in full,  then this instrument and
the estate hereby granted shall cease and become void).

                  (d)  Specifically,  but without  limiting  the  generality  of
SUBSECTION (b) of this ARTICLE XII, the Lessor and the Lessee further intend and
agree that,  with  respect to that portion of the Leased  Property  constituting
personal property,  for the purpose of securing the Lessee's obligations for the
repayment to the Lessor of the  above-described  loan, (i) this Lease shall also
be deemed to be a security agreement and financing  statement within the meaning
of Article 9 of the Uniform  Commercial  Code; (ii) the conveyance  provided for
hereby  shall be deemed to be a grant by the  Lessee to the Lessor of a lien and
security  interest in all of the Lessee's  present and future  right,  title and
interest  in and to such  portion  of the  Leased  Property,  including  but not
limited  to the  Lessee's  leasehold  estate  therein  and all  proceeds  of the
conversion,  voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing, into cash, investments,
securities  or  other  property,  whether  in the  form  of  cash,  investments,
securities or other property to secure such loans, effective on the date hereof,
to have and to hold such  interests in the Leased  Property  unto the Lessor and
its successors  and assigns,  forever,  PROVIDED  ALWAYS that these presents are
upon the express  condition that, if all amounts due under this Lease shall have
been paid and  satisfied in full,  then this  instrument  and the estate  hereby
granted shall cease and become void; (iii) the possession by the Lessor of notes
and such other items of property as constitute  instruments,  money,  negotiable
documents  or chattel  paper  shall be deemed to be  "possession  by the secured
party" for  purposes

                                      -18-
<PAGE>
of  perfecting  the security  interest  pursuant to Section 9-305 of the Uniform
Commercial Code; and (iv)  notifications  to Persons holding such property,  and
acknowledgements,  receipts  or  confirmations  from  financial  intermediaries,
bankers or agents  (as  applicable)  of the Lessee  shall be deemed to have been
given for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under Applicable Law.
The Lessor and the Lessee shall, to the extent  consistent with this Lease, take
such  actions  and  execute,  deliver,  file and record  such  other  documents,
financing  statements,   mortgages  and  deeds  of  trust,  including,   without
limitation,  each  Memorandum  of Lease,  as may be necessary to ensure that, if
this Lease were deemed to create a security  interest in the Leased  Property in
accordance with this ARTICLE XII, such security interest would be deemed to be a
perfected  security  interest with priority over all Liens other than  Permitted
Liens,  under Applicable Law and will be maintained as such throughout the Lease
Term.

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

         The following  events shall  constitute  Events of Default (whether any
such event shall be  voluntary  or  involuntary  or come about or be effected by
operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance  with any  judgment,  decree or
order of any court or any order,  rule or  regulation of any  administrative  or
governmental body):

         (a) the Lessee  shall fail to make any  payment of Basic Rent when due,
or, with respect to any Rent Payment Date other than the  Scheduled  Termination
Date, within a period of four days after written notice of such failure has been
given to the Lessee and the Guarantor;

         (b) the Lessee shall fail to make any payment of Supplemental Rent when
due and such failure shall continue for a period of 10 days after written notice
of such failure has been given to the Lessee and the Guarantor.

         (c) the Lessee shall fail to pay the Lease Balance when due pursuant to
SECTIONS 11.1,  11.2,  15.1 or 15.2 hereof,  or the Lessee shall fail to pay the
Recourse Deficiency Amount when required pursuant to ARTICLE XV hereof;

         (d) the Lessee shall fail to maintain insurance as required by ARTICLE
IX hereof;

         (e) [reserved];

         (f) any  representation  or  warranty  by the  Lessee in any  Operative
Document or in any certificate or document  delivered to the Lessor,  the Issuer
or the Credit Bank pursuant to any Operative Document, shall have been incorrect
in any material  respect when made and has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Lessee;

         (g) (i) the  entry  of a  decree  or  order  by a court  or  agency  or
supervisory  authority  of  competent  jurisdiction  for  the  appointment  of a
conservator,  receiver,  liquidator or trustee for the Lessee in any bankruptcy,
receivership,  conservatorship,  insolvency or similar  proceedings,  or for the
winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and any such decree or order continues
unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive  days, or (ii) the consent
by the Lessee to the  appointment  of a

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

conservator,  receiver,  liquidator or trustee for the Lessee in any bankruptcy,
receivership,  conservatorship, insolvency or similar proceedings of or relating
to the Lessee or relating to  substantially  all its property,  the admission in
writing by the Lessee of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become
due, the filing by the Lessee of a petition to take  advantage of any applicable
bankruptcy,  receivership,  conservatorship,  insolvency or similar statute, the
making by the Lessee of an  assignment  for the benefit of its  creditors or the
voluntary suspension by the Lessee of payment of its obligations;

         (h) the Lessee shall fail in any material  respect to timely perform or
observe any covenant,  condition or agreement  (not included in CLAUSE (a), (b),
(c),  (d),  (e),  (f),  (g), (i) or (j) of this ARTICLE XIII) to be performed or
observed by it hereunder or under the other Operative Documents and such failure
shall  continue  for a period of 30 days after the  Lessee's  receipt of written
notice thereof from the Lessor (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if such failure is other than
the  payment of money and is of such  nature  that it can be  corrected  but not
within the applicable period, then that failure shall not constitute an Event of
Default so long as the Lessee  institutes  curative action within the applicable
period and diligently pursues that action to completion);

         (i) a failure of the Lessee to perform any term,  covenant or agreement
on its part to be performed  under any agreement or  instrument  (other than the
Operative Documents) evidencing,  securing or relating to any indebtedness owing
by the Lessee when required to be performed, if the effect of such failure is to
accelerate the maturity of such  indebtedness or to permit the holder or holders
of such  indebtedness or the trustee or trustees under any such  indebtedness to
cause such indebtedness to become due prior to the stated maturity thereof,  and
such failure shall  continue for a period of 45 days after the expiration of any
applicable grace or cure periods  (PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  if such failure is other
than the payment of money and is of such nature that it can be corrected but not
within such 45 days,  then that failure shall not constitute an Event of Default
so  long as the  Lessee  institutes  curative  action  within  such  period  and
diligently pursues that action to completion);

         (j) the occurrence of any event or condition designated as an "Event of
Default" under the Parent Guaranty.


                                   ARTICLE XIV
                                   ENFORCEMENT

         SECTION 14.1 REMEDIES.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and
at any time  thereafter,  the  Lessor  may,  so long as such Event of Default is
continuing, do one or more of the following as the Lessor in its sole discretion
shall determine,  without limiting any other right or remedy the Lessor may have
on  account  of such  Event  of  Default  (including,  without  limitation,  the
obligation  of the  Lessee  to  purchase  the  Leased  Property  as set forth in
SECTIONS 15.2 and 15.3 hereof):

         (a) Subject to SUBSECTION  (e) of this SECTION 14.1, the Lessor may, by
notice to the Lessee,  rescind or terminate  this Lease as of the date specified
in such notice (the "Final Rent Payment  Date"),  which date shall,  unless such
notice is  subsequently  rescinded by the Lessor,  become the Lease  Termination
Date, and the Lessee shall be required to purchase the Leased

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

Property  pursuant  to  SECTION  15.2  hereof;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that (i) no
reletting,  reentry or taking of possession of the Leased Property by the Lessor
will be construed as an election on the  Lessor's  part to terminate  this Lease
unless  a  written  notice  of such  intention  is  given  to the  Lessee,  (ii)
notwithstanding any reletting,  reentry or taking of possession,  the Lessor may
at any time thereafter  elect to terminate this Lease for a continuing  Event of
Default  and  (iii) no act or thing  done by the  Lessor  or any of its  agents,
representatives  or  employees  and no  agreement  accepting a surrender  of the
Leased  Property  shall be valid unless the same be made in writing and executed
by the Lessor.

         (b) Subject to SUBSECTION  (e) of this SECTION 14.1, the Lessor may (i)
demand that the  Lessee,  and the Lessee  shall upon the  written  demand of the
Lessor,  return and surrender the Leased Property  promptly to the Lessor in the
manner and condition  required by, and  otherwise in accordance  with all of the
provisions of,  ARTICLES VII and XV hereof as if the Leased  Property were being
returned  at the end of the Lease Term,  and the Lessor  shall not be liable for
the  reimbursement  of the Lessee  for any costs and  expenses  incurred  by the
Lessee in connection  therewith  and (ii) without  prejudice to any other remedy
which the Lessor may have for  possession  of the  Leased  Property,  and to the
extent and in the manner  permitted  by  Applicable  Law,  enter upon the Leased
Property and take  immediate  possession of (to the exclusion of the Lessee) the
Leased Property or any part thereof and expel or remove the Lessee and any other
Person who may be  occupying  the Leased  Property,  by summary  proceedings  or
otherwise, all without liability to the Lessee for or by reason of such entry or
taking of possession,  whether for the  restoration of damage to property caused
by such taking or otherwise and, in addition to the Lessor's other damages,  the
Lessee shall be responsible for the reasonable and documented costs and expenses
of reletting, including brokers' fees and the reasonable and documented costs of
any alterations or repairs made by the Lessor.

         (c) Subject to SUBSECTION  (e) of this SECTION 14.1, the Lessor may (i)
sell all or any part of the Leased  Property at public or private  sale,  as the
Lessor may determine, free and clear of any rights of the Lessee and without any
duty to account to the Lessee  with  respect to such  action or  inaction or any
proceeds with respect  thereto  (except to the extent required by CLAUSE (ii) of
this SUBSECTION (c) if the Lessor shall elect to exercise its rights thereunder)
in which event the Lessee's  obligation to pay Basic Rent  hereunder for periods
commencing  after the date of such sale shall be terminated  or  proportionately
reduced,  as the case may be and (ii) if the Lessor shall so elect,  demand that
the Lessee pay to the Lessor,  and the Lessee  shall pay to the  Lessor,  on the
date of such sale,  as  liquidated  damages  for loss of a bargain  and not as a
penalty (the parties hereto  agreeing that the Lessor's  actual damages would be
difficult to predict,  but the  aforementioned  liquidated  damages  represent a
reasonable  approximation of such amount) (in lieu of Basic Rent due for periods
commencing on or after the Rent Payment Date  coinciding  with such date of sale
(or, if the sale date is not a Rent  Payment  Date,  the Rent  Payment Date next
preceding the date of such sale)), an amount equal to (A) the excess, if any, of
(1) the sum of all Rent due and unpaid to and  including  such Rent Payment Date
plus an amount  equal to the Lease  Balance  as of the date of sale over (2) the
net  proceeds  of such sale (that is,  after  deducting  all costs and  expenses
incurred by or on behalf of the Lessor incident to such  conveyance  (including,
without limitation,  all costs, expenses,  fees, premiums and taxes described in
SECTION 15.5(b) hereof),  plus (B) interest at the Overdue Rate on the foregoing
amount from such Rent  Payment  Date until the date of  payment.  Any amounts so
collected  pursuant  to this  SUBSECTION  (c)  shall  be  applied  (after  first
deducting  amounts expended by the Lessor in connection with the Leased Property
and the  Operative  Documents  and not then

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

reimbursed)  to reduce the Lease Balance.  The Lessor agrees,  upon the Lessee's
written request and at the Lessee's sole expense,  to provide the Lessee with an
accounting  showing in reasonable  detail the  application of amounts  collected
pursuant to this SUBSECTION (c).

         (d) The Lessor may, at its option,  elect not to  terminate  the Lease,
and continue to collect all Basic Rent,  Supplemental Rent and all other amounts
due the Lessor  (together with all costs of collection) and enforce the Lessee's
obligations  under  this  Lease as and when the same  become  due,  or are to be
performed,  and at the option of the Lessor,  upon any abandonment of the Leased
Property by the Lessee and  re-entry  of same by the Lessor,  the Lessor may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, elect not to terminate this Lease and may make
such reasonable  alterations and necessary  repairs in order to relet the Leased
Property,  and relet the Leased  Property  or any part  thereof for such term or
terms (which may be for a long term extending beyond the term of this Lease) and
at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as the Lessor
in its reasonable  discretion may deem  advisable.  Upon each such reletting all
rentals actually  received by the Lessor from such reletting shall be applied to
the Lessee's obligations hereunder in such order, proportion and priority as the
Lessor  may elect in the  Lessor's  sole and  absolute  discretion,  and if such
rentals  received from such  reletting  during any Rent Period are less than the
Rent to be paid  during  that Rent  Period by the Lessee  hereunder,  the Lessee
shall pay any deficiency, as calculated by the Lessor, to the Lessor on the Rent
Payment Date in such Rent Period.

         (e) Before exercising its rights under SUBSECTIONS (a), (b), (c) or (d)
of this SECTION 14.1 with respect to the Leased Property, the Lessor shall first
permit the Lessee to  purchase,  on or before the Default  Rent Payment Date (as
hereinafter  defined),  the Lessor's  interest in all, but not less than all, of
the Leased Property in accordance with the provisions of SECTIONS 15.2, 15.4 and
15.5 hereof;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that such purchase shall occur on the date set
forth in the notice provided for in the following sentence,  notwithstanding the
provisions  in such SECTION 15.2 calling for such purchase to occur on the Lease
Termination  Date.  Before exercising its rights under SUBSECTIONS (a), (b), (c)
or (d) of this SECTION 14.1,  the Lessor shall provide the Lessee with a written
notice stating (i) that an Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing,
(ii) that,  if left  uncured,  the  Lessor  intends to pursue one or more of the
remedies set forth in SUBSECTIONS  (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this SECTION 14.1 if
the Lessee does not purchase  the Leased  Property on or before the Default Rent
Payment Date, (iii) the date specified by the Lessor as the Default Rent Payment
Date and (iv) that the Lessee  must either cure the Event of Default or purchase
all, but not less than all, of the Leased Property on or before the Default Rent
Payment Date pursuant to the provisions of SECTIONS 15.2,  15.4 and 15.5 hereof.
As used  herein,  "DEFAULT  RENT  PAYMENT  DATE"  shall mean the  Business  Day,
selected by the Lessor,  occurring at least 30 days after the date of the notice
described in the immediately  preceding  sentence or if less than 30 days remain
until the Scheduled  Termination Date, such Scheduled Termination Date. It shall
only be  necessary  for the Lessor to provide  the  Lessee  one  opportunity  to
purchase the Leased  Property  pursuant to this SUBSECTION (e) unless the Credit
Bank and the Lessor shall,  in a written  notice  delivered to the Lessee,  have
waived the Event of Default and expressly reinstated the Lessee's opportunity to
purchase  the  Lessor's  interest  in  the  Leased  Property  pursuant  to  this
subsection.

         (f) To the extent not inconsistent  with SUBSECTION (e) of this SECTION
14.1, the Lessor may exercise any other right or remedy that may be available to
it under  Applicable  Law,  or proceed by  appropriate  court  action  (legal or
equitable)  to enforce  the terms  hereof or to recover

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

damages for the breach hereof. Separate suits may be brought to collect any such
damages for any Rent Period(s), and such suits shall not in any manner prejudice
the  Lessor's  right  to  collect  any  such  damages  for any  subsequent  Rent
Period(s),  or the Lessor may defer any such suit until after the  expiration of
the Lease  Term,  in which  event such suit shall be deemed not to have  accrued
until the expiration of the Lease Term.

         (g) The Lessor may retain and apply  against the  Lessor's  damages all
sums which the Lessor would,  absent such Event of Default,  be required to pay,
or turn over, to the Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Lease.

         SECTION 14.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE;  NO WAIVER;  CONSENTS.  To the extent
permitted  by, and subject to the  mandatory  requirements  of,  Applicable  Law
(subject in all events to SECTION 14.1(e) hereof),  each and every right,  power
and remedy  herein  specifically  given to the Lessor or otherwise in this Lease
shall be  cumulative  and shall be in addition to every other  right,  power and
remedy herein  specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity
or by statute,  and each and every right, power and remedy whether  specifically
herein  given or otherwise  existing  may be exercised  from time to time and as
often  and in such  order as may be  deemed  expedient  by the  Lessor,  and the
exercise or the  beginning  of the  exercise of any power or remedy shall not be
construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter
any right,  power or remedy.  No delay or omission by the Lessor in the exercise
of any right,  power or remedy or in the pursuit of any remedy  shall impair any
such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the
part of the Lessee or to be an acquiescence therein. The Lessor's consent to any
request  made by the Lessee  shall not be deemed to  constitute  or preclude the
necessity  for  obtaining the Lessor's  consent,  in the future,  to all similar
requests.  No express  or  implied  waiver by the Lessor of any Event of Default
shall in any way be,  or be  construed  to be, a waiver of any  future  Event of
Default. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Lessee hereby waives any
rights now or hereafter  conferred by statute or otherwise  that may require the
Lessor to sell,  lease or otherwise  use the Leased  Property or part thereof in
mitigation of the Lessor's damages upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or
that may otherwise  limit or modify any of the Lessor's rights or remedies under
this ARTICLE XIV.

                                   ARTICLE XV
                      SALE, RETURN OR PURCHASE OF PROPERTY

         SECTION 15.1 LESSEE'S  OPTION TO  PURCHASE.  Subject to the terms and
conditions and  provisions set forth in this ARTICLE XV,  PROVIDED that no Event
of Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing  Lessee shall have the option
(the  "PURCHASE  OPTION"),  exercisable  at any time during the Lease Term on or
prior to the tenth Business Day next preceding the Scheduled  Termination  Date,
to purchase from the Lessor the Lessor's interest in any of the Properties for a
purchase price equal to the Purchase Option Price for such Property. Such option
must be  exercised by written  notice to the Lessor and the Credit  Bank,  which
exercise shall be irrevocable, and such notice will specify the closing date for
the Lessee's  purchase of the  specified  Property,  which date shall be (i) not
less than ten (10)  Business  Days or more than 90 calendar  days  following the
Lessor's  receipt  of such  notice  and (ii) in any  event  not  later  than the
Scheduled  Termination Date. If the Purchase Option is exercised pursuant to the
foregoing, then, subject to the provisions set

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

forth in this ARTICLE XV, on such closing  date,  the Lessor shall convey to the
Lessee,  and the Lessee shall  purchase from the Lessor,  all, but not less than
all, of the Lessor's interest in the specified Property.  If the Lessee fails to
exercise the Purchase Option in a timely manner,  then the Purchase Option shall
thereupon  automatically terminate without any further action of the Lessor, and
the Purchase Option shall thereafter be of no force or effect.

         SECTION 15.2 EXTENSION; PURCHASE OBLIGATION.

         (a)  EXTENSION  OF LEASE TERM.  Provided  that (i) the Lessee shall not
have  exercised the Purchase  Option and  purchased  all of the Leased  Property
pursuant  thereto,  (ii) the Lessee  shall not have  exercised  the  Remarketing
Option and fulfilled all of the conditions of SECTION 15.6 hereof,  (iii) in the
event the Lessee shall have exercised the  Remarketing  Option and fulfilled the
conditions  of SECTION  15.6  hereof,  the Lessor shall not have either sold its
interest in the Leased Property  pursuant thereto or rejected such sale pursuant
to SECTION 15.6(XI)  hereof,  and (iv) no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and remain uncured,  THEN, on or prior to the Lease  Termination  Date,
the  Lessee and the Lessor may  provide  for an  extension  to the Lease Term on
mutually  agreeable  terms,  provided that all such  amendments to the Operative
Documents necessary to implement such extension  (including,  but not limited to
required amendments of the Borrower Promissory Note) shall be mutually agreeable
to all parties to the Participation  Agreement,  except that the approval of the
Credit  Bank  shall  not be  required  in the  event  that all  Letter of Credit
Liabilities and other amounts payable to the Credit Bank under the Reimbursement
Agreement  have been paid in full, the Letter of Credit shall have been returned
to the Credit Bank for  cancellation,  and an  Alternate  Letter of Credit shall
have been  delivered to the Note Trustee in accordance  with SECTION 8.05 of the
Note Indenture and SECTION 2.8 of the Participation Agreement.

         (b)  PURCHASE  OBLIGATION.  Unless  any one of the  following  numbered
events shall have  occurred:  (i) the Lessee shall have  properly  exercised the
Purchase  Option with respect to all of the Leased Property and purchased all of
the  Leased  Property  pursuant  thereto;  (ii) the Lessee  shall have  properly
exercised the Remarketing  Option and shall have fulfilled all of the conditions
of SECTION 15.6 hereof and the Lessor shall have sold its interest in the Leased
Property  pursuant thereto;  (iii) the Lessee shall have properly  exercised the
Remarketing  Option and shall have  fulfilled  all of the  conditions of SECTION
15.6 hereof but the Lessor  shall have  rejected  such sale  pursuant to SECTION
15.6(xi)  hereof and the  Lessee  shall then have  timely  fulfilled  all of its
obligations  under  SECTION 15.7 and 15.8  hereof;  or (iv) the Lease Term shall
have been extended in accordance with SECTION 15.2(a) hereof;  THEN,  subject to
the terms,  conditions  and  provisions set forth in this ARTICLE XV, the Lessee
shall  purchase from the Lessor,  and the Lessor shall convey to the Lessee,  on
the Lease  Termination Date all of the Lessor's  interest in the Leased Property
for the  purchase  price  specified  in  SECTION  15.4  hereof.  The  Lessee may
designate,  in a notice given to the Lessor not less than ten (10) Business Days
prior  to the  closing  of  such  purchase  (time  being  of the  essence),  the
transferee to whom the  conveyance  shall be made (if other than to the Lessee),
in which case such  conveyance  shall  (subject to the terms and  conditions set
forth herein) be made to such designee; provided, however, that such designation
of a transferee  shall not cause the Lessee to be released,  fully or partially,
from any of its obligations under this Lease.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 15.3 ACCELERATION OF PURCHASE OBLIGATION.  The Lessee shall be

the Lessee's  obligations  under SECTION 15.5 hereof or otherwise)  the Lessor's
obligations  under SECTION 15.5(a) hereof shall be limited to delivery of a quit
claim deed of the Leased Property.

         SECTION 15.4 DETERMINATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. Upon the purchase by the

         (c) The Lessee  shall,  at Lessee's  sole cost and expense,  obtain all
required  governmental and regulatory  approval and consents and shall make such
filings as required by Applicable  Law. In the event that the Lessor is required
by Applicable Law to take any action in connection  with such purchase and sale,

fees,  commissions,  the Lessee's and the Lessor's escrow fees,  recording fees,

delivery of such deed shall be borne entirely and paid by the Lessee.

         (d)  Upon   expiration  or  termination  of  this  Lease  resulting  in
conveyance of the Lessor's  interest in the title to the Leased  Property to the
Lessee, there shall be no apportionment of taxes, insurance,  utility charges or
other charges  payable with respect to the Leased  Property,  all of such taxes,
insurance,  utility or other  charges due and payable with respect to the Leased
Property prior to termination  being payable by the Lessee hereunder and all due
after  such time  being  payable  by the  Lessee as the then owner of the Leased
Property.

         SECTION 15.6 OPTION TO REMARKET.  Subject to the fulfillment of each of
the  conditions set forth in this SECTION 15.6, the Lessee shall have the option
(the  "Remarketing  Option") to market the Leased Property for the Lessor and to
procure a purchaser  therefor.  The Lessee's effective exercise and consummation
of the Remarketing  Option shall be subject to the due and timely fulfillment of
each of the following  provisions,  the failure of any of which shall render the
Remarketing  Option and the Lessee's  exercise  thereof null and void,  in which
event,  the Lessee shall be obligated to perform its  obligations  under SECTION
15.2 hereof, "Purchase Obligation":

                  (i)   Not earlier than six months nor later than 90 days
         before the Scheduled Termination Date, the Lessee shall give to the
         Lessor written  notice of the  Lessee's  exercise of the  Remarketing
         Option, which exercise shall be irrevocable  unless otherwise agreed in
         writing by the Credit Bank.

                  (ii)   Not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
         Lease Termination   Date,  the Lessee shall deliver  to the  Lessor  an
         environmental  assessment of the Leased  Property  dated not later than
         forty-five  (45)  days  prior  to  the  Lease  Termination  Date.  Such
         environmental   assessment   shall  be  prepared  by  an  environmental
         consultant  selected  by the Lessee and  reasonably  acceptable  to the
         Lessor  and the Credit  Bank,  shall be in form,  detail and  substance
         reasonably  acceptable  to the Lessor and the  Credit  Bank,  and shall
         otherwise  indicate the environmental  condition of the Leased Property
         to be the same as described in the  Environmental  Audit for the Leased
         Property delivered in connection with the Closing.

                  (iii)  On the date of the Lessee's notice to the Lessor of the
         Lessee's exercise of the Remarketing  Option, no Event of Default shall
         exist,  and  thereafter,  no Event of Default  shall have  occurred and
         remain outstanding on the Scheduled Termination Date.

<PAGE>
                  (iv)   The  Lessee  shall  have   completed  all  Alterations,
         restoration and rebuilding of the Leased Property  pursuant to SECTIONS
         7.2, 11.3 and 11.4 hereof (as the case may be) and shall have fulfilled
         all of the conditions and requirements in connection therewith pursuant
         to said Sections, in each case by the date on which the Lessor receives
         the Lessee's notice of the Lessee's exercise of the Remarketing  Option
         (time being of the  essence),  regardless  of whether the same shall be
         within the Lessee's control.

                  (v)    Once the Lessee has exercised the Remarketing Option as
         provided  in CLAUSE (I) of this  SECTION  15.6,  the Lessee  shall,  as
         nonexclusive agent for the Lessor, use commercially  reasonable efforts
         to sell the Lessor's  interest in the Leased  Property and will attempt
         to obtain the  highest  purchase  price  therefor.  The Lessee  will be
         responsible for hiring brokers and making the Leased Property available
         for  inspection by  prospective  purchasers.  The Lessee shall promptly
         provide any maintenance  records relating to the Leased Property to the
         Lessor and any potential purchaser upon request, and shall otherwise do
         all  things  necessary  to sell and  deliver  possession  of the Leased
         Property to the purchaser.  All such  marketing of the Leased  Property
         shall be at the  Lessee's  sole  expense.  The Lessee  shall  allow the
         Lessor, the Credit Bank and any potential qualified purchaser access to
         the Leased Property for the purpose of inspecting the same.

                  (vi)   The  Lessee shall submit all bids to the Lessor and the
         Credit  Bank and the Lessor and the Credit  Bank will have the right to
         review the same and the right to submit any one or more bids.  All bids
         shall be on an "all-cash"  basis (at least up to the Lease Balance with
         respect to such Leased  Property).  The Lessee shall  procure bids from
         one or more bona fide  prospective  purchasers and shall deliver to the
         Lessor and the Credit  Bank not less than ninety (90) days prior to the
         Lease  Termination  Date a binding  written  irrevocable  offer by such
         purchaser  offering  (subject  to  customary  conditions  which  do not
         violate the provisions of CLAUSE viii of this SECTION 15.6) the highest
         "all-cash" bid to purchase the Leased  Property.  Such purchaser  shall
         not be the Lessee or any  Subsidiary  or Affiliate  of the Lessee.  The
         written  offer must specify the Lease  Termination  Date as the closing
         date.

                  (vii)  On  the  Lease  Termination  Date,   the Lessee  shall
         surrender the Leased Property in accordance with SECTION 15.8 hereof.

                  (viii) In  connection  with  any  such  sale of the  Lessor's
         interest  in  the  Leased  Property,  the  Lessee  may  provide  to the
         purchaser any such customary  "seller's"  indemnities,  representations
         and  warranties  regarding  title,  absence of Liens  (except  Lessor's
         Liens) and the  condition of the Leased  Property,  including,  without
         limitation,  an environmental indemnity, as the Lessee may determine to
         provide in the exercise of its business  judgment and sole  discretion,
         PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that  no  such  indemnities,   representations  or
         warranties  shall be  binding  on the  Lessor,  nor shall  they  create
         liabilities, charges, offsets or Claims, contingent or otherwise, which
         could  diminish,  offset or  impose a lien upon the  amount of the cash
         proceeds payable to the Lessor under such purchase offer, nor shall the
         Lessor be under any  obligation to join in or become  obligated for the
         same,  except that the Lessor shall fulfill all of the requirements set
         forth in CLAUSE (b) of SECTION 15.5 hereof,  and such  requirements are
         incorporated herein by reference. As to the

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

         Lessor, any such sale shall be made on an "AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS"
         basis without  representation or warranty by the Lessor other than the
         absence of Lessor's Liens.

                  (ix)   The  Lessor  shall  pay  from  the  sale  proceeds, all
         prorations,  credits,  costs  and  expenses  of the sale of the  Leased
         Property, including without limitation the cost of all title insurance,
         surveys,   environmental  reports,  appraisals,   transfer  taxes,  the
         Lessor's  reasonable   attorneys'  fees,   commissions,   escrow  fees,
         recording  fees,  and all  applicable  documentary  and other  transfer
         taxes.

                  (x)    The Lessee shall  pay to the  Credit  Bank on the Lease
         Termination  Date an amount  equal to the  Recourse  Deficiency  Amount
         applicable to the Leased  Property,  in the type of funds  specified in
         SECTION 4.3 hereof.

                  (xi)   If  the  selling price  (net of closing  costs  and
         prorations and other amounts payable by the Lessor under CLAUSE (ix) of
         this  SECTION  15.6,  as  reasonably  estimated by the Lessor) plus the
         Recourse  Deficiency  Amount is less than the Lease  Balance,  then the
         Lessor  may,  and at the written  request of the Credit Bank shall,  by
         notice to the  Lessee,  subject  to SECTION  4.01 of the  Reimbursement
         Agreement,  reject such offer to  purchase,  in which event the parties
         hereto  will  proceed  according  to the  provisions  of  SECTION  15.7
         "Rejection of Sale" hereof.

                  (xii)  If the Lessor  does not reject  such  purchase offer as
         provided above,  the closing of such purchase of the Leased Property by
         such   purchaser   must   occur   on  the   Lease   Termination   Date,
         contemporaneously with the Lessee's surrender of the Leased Property in
         accordance with SECTION 15.8 hereof.

                  (xiii) If the Lessor  does not reject  the  purchase  offer as
         provided  above,  then the purchase  shall be  consummated on the Lease
         Termination  Date and the gross  proceeds  of the sale  (i.e.,  without
         deduction  for any  marketing,  closing or other costs,  prorations  or
         commissions)  shall be paid  directly  to the  Credit  Bank;  PROVIDED,
         HOWEVER,  that if the sum of the gross proceeds from such sale plus the
         Recourse  Deficiency Amount exceeds the Lease Balance, as of such date,
         then an amount of gross  proceeds  from such sale equal to such  excess
         shall be paid to the Lessee on the Lease Termination Date.

If one or more of the  foregoing  provisions  shall not be  fulfilled  as of the
Lease  Termination  Date or if the Leased Property is not purchased as aforesaid
for any other reason whatsoever other than solely due to rejection by the Lessor
of such sale pursuant to SUBSECTION  (xi) of this SECTION 15.6,  then the Lessor
may,  and at the written  request of the Credit  Bank shall,  subject to SECTION
4.01 of the Reimbursement Agreement, declare by written notice to the Lessee the
Remarketing  Option to be null and void (whether or not it has been  theretofore
exercised by the Lessee),  in which event all of the Lessee's  rights under this
SECTION 15.6 shall  immediately  terminate  and the Lessee shall be obligated to
purchase  the  Leased  Property  pursuant  to SECTION  15.2  hereof on the Lease
Termination Date. If the prospective  purchaser  breaches its offer to purchase,
then the Lessor may, in the Lessor's sole  discretion,  declare the  Remarketing
Option to be null and void, in which event all of the Lessee's rights under this
SECTION 15.6 shall  immediately  terminate  and the Lessee shall be obligated to
purchase the Leased Property  pursuant to SECTION 15.2 hereof.  The Lessee shall
have no

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

right,  power or  authority  to bind the Lessor in  connection  with any
proposed sale of the Leased Property.

         SECTION 15.7  REJECTION OF SALE.

                  (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
if the Lessor rejects the purchase offer for the Leased  Property as provided in
SECTION 15.6(xi) hereof, then (i) on the Lease Termination Date the Lessee shall
pay to the Credit Bank without notice or demand the Recourse  Deficiency  Amount
in the manner provided in SECTION  15.6(x) hereof,  (ii) the Lessor shall retain
title to the  Leased  Property  and  (iii) in  addition  to the  Lessee's  other
obligations hereunder,  the Lessee shall be responsible for, and shall reimburse
the  Lessor,  within ten (10)  Business  Days  after  written  request,  for all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lessor during the period ending on
the first  anniversary of the Lease  Termination Date in connection with owning,
paying taxes with respect to, maintaining, insuring, marketing, sale, closing or
transfer  of the Leased  Property,  which  obligation  shall  survive  the Lease
Termination Date and the termination or expiration of this Lease.

                  (b) Following  any  rejection  by the Lessor of the  purchase
offer for the Leased  Property  pursuant to the  provisions of SECTION  15.6(XI)
hereof, subject to the condition that the Lessee shall have:

                      (i)   timely  paid the  Recourse Deficiency Amount to the
                  Credit Bank on or before the Lease Termination Date,

                      (ii)  duly  and  timely  fulfilled  each  of the  other
                  provisions  of the  Remarketing Conditions on or before the
                  Lease Termination Date, and

                      (iii) on and after the Lease Termination Date, timely
                  fulfilled  each and every  obligation of the Lessee under this
                  Lease,  the  Participation  Agreement and the other  Operative
                  Documents on its part to be performed, and no Event of Default
                  shall have occurred, THEN,

upon the subsequent  sale of the Leased Property by the Lessor to a third party,
the Lessor shall pay to the Lessee an amount equal to the Lessor's gain (if any)
on the sale,  computed taking into account the Lessor's total  investment in the
Leased Property (including, without limitation, any portion of the Lease Balance
remaining  unpaid  after  application  of the  Recourse  Deficiency  Amount paid
pursuant  to  SECTION  15.6(x)  hereof,   if  any)  plus  all  of  the  Lessor's
unreimbursed  costs and expenses  (capital or otherwise)  relating to the Leased
Property,  plus an annual return thereon  computed at the Overdue Rate, less the
net avails of any reletting of the Leased  Property or any part thereof.  To the
extent  that the Lessor  shall  receive  payment  in the form of  purchase-money
indebtedness  in connection  with any such sale, the Lessor's duty to account to
the Lessee  pursuant to this SECTION  15.7(b) shall be suspended until such time
as the Lessor receives payment thereon.

         SECTION  15.8 RETURN AND  SURRENDER OF LEASED  PROPERTY.  If the Lessor
retains title to the Leased Property  pursuant to SECTION 15.7 hereof,  then the
Lessee shall, on the Lease Termination Date, and at its own expense,  return and
surrender  possession of the Leased  Property to the Lessor for retention by the
Lessor or if the Lessee properly  exercises the Remarketing  Option and fulfills
all of the conditions of SECTION 15.6 hereof and the Lessor does not reject such
purchase  offer  pursuant  to SECTION  15.6(xi)  hereof,  then the Lessee  shall
(unless by agreement with the purchaser the Lessee is to remain in possession of
the  Leased  Property),  on the  Lease  Termination  Date  and at its own  cost,
transfer and  surrender  possession  of the Leased  Property to the  independent
purchaser thereof,  in each case by surrendering the same into the possession of
the Lessor or such  purchaser,  as the case may be,  free and clear of all Liens
other than Lessor Liens and Liens  described in CLAUSE (vi) of the definition of
Permitted  Liens,  in as good  condition  as it was on the  Completion  Date (as
modified  by  Alterations  permitted  by this  Lease),  ordinary  wear  and tear
excepted, and in compliance with Applicable Law. The Lessee shall, on and within
a reasonable time before and after the Lease  Termination  Date,  cooperate with
the Lessor and the  independent  purchaser  of the Leased  Property  in order to
facilitate the ownership and operation by such purchaser of the Leased  Property
after the Lease Termination Date, which cooperation shall include the following,
all of which the Lessee shall do on or before the Lease  Termination  Date or as
soon  thereafter as is reasonably  practicable:  providing all books and records
regarding the maintenance and ownership of the Leased Property and all know-how,
data and technical  information  relating  thereto to the extent in the Lessee's
possession, providing a current copy of the Plans and Specifications,  assigning
all licenses  necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Leased Property
to the extent the Lessee has the legal right to do so and cooperating in seeking
and obtaining all necessary  Governmental  Action  relating to occupancy but not
special use by the purchaser  thereof.  The Lessee shall have also paid the cost
of all Alterations commenced prior to the Lease Termination Date. The obligation
of the Lessee under this ARTICLE XV shall survive the  expiration or termination
of this Lease.

         SECTION 15.9 EFFECT OF CONVEYANCE TO THE LESSEE. Upon conveyance of the
Leased  Property  after  the  exercise  by the  Lessee  of any of its  rights to
purchase the Leased Property,  including its rights under SECTION 14.1(e) hereof
or after  exercise of the  Remarketing  Option,  this Lease shall  automatically
terminate unless the Lessee otherwise elects in writing.  Upon such termination,
the  parties  hereto  shall  execute,  acknowledge  and deliver to each other an
appropriate agreement evidencing such termination in recordable form.

                                   ARTICLE XVI
                               LESSEE'S EQUIPMENT

         After any  repossession  of the Leased  Property  (whether  or not this
Lease has been  terminated),  the  Lessee,  at its  expense  and so long as such
removal  shall not result in a violation  of  Applicable  Law,  shall,  within a
reasonable  time after  such  repossession  or within  sixty (60) days after the
Lessee's receipt of the Lessor's written request  (whichever shall first occur),
remove all of the Lessee's trade fixtures,  personal property and equipment from
the Leased Property (to the extent that the same can be readily removed from the
Leased Property without causing  material damage to or materially  impairing the
value of the Leased  Property);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the Lessee  shall not
remove any fixture, equipment or personal property which constitutes part of the
Leased  Property.  Any of the Lessee's  trade  fixtures,  personal  property and
equipment  not so removed by

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

the Lessee within such period shall be considered  abandoned by the Lessee,  and
title  thereto  shall  without  further  act  vest  to the  Lessor,  and  may be
appropriated,  sold,  destroyed or otherwise  disposed of by the Lessor  without
notice to the Lessee and without  obligation to account  therefor and the Lessee
will pay the Lessor,  upon written demand,  all reasonable and documented  costs
and  expenses  incurred by the Lessor in  removing,  storing or disposing of the
same and all costs and  expenses  incurred by the Lessor to repair any damage to
the Leased Property caused by such removal.  The Lessee will immediately  repair
at its  expense  all damage to the Leased  Property  caused by any such  removal
(unless such removal is effected by the Lessor,  in which event the Lessee shall
pay all reasonable costs and expenses  incurred by the Lessor for such repairs).
The Lessor shall have no liability in exercising the Lessor's  rights under this
ARTICLE  XVI, nor shall the Lessor be  responsible  for any loss of or damage to
the Lessee's personal property and equipment in connection therewith.

                                  ARTICLE XVII
                           RIGHT TO PERFORM FOR LESSEE

         If  the  Lessee  shall  fail  to  perform  or  comply  with  any of its
agreements  contained  herein the Lessor may, on thirty (30) days' prior  notice
(or such lesser  period  afforded by Applicable  Law or any third party,  except
that no notice shall be required in the case of a default in the  observance  of
the  obligations  to  maintain  insurance  pursuant to ARTICLE IX hereto) to the
Lessee, perform or comply with such agreement,  and the Lessor shall not thereby
be deemed to have waived any default  caused by such failure,  and the amount of
such payment and the amount of the expenses of the Lessor (including  reasonable
attorney's  fees and expenses)  incurred in connection  with such payment or the
performance of or compliance with such  agreement,  as the case may be, shall be
deemed  Supplemental  Rent,  payable by the Lessee to the Lessor within ten (10)

prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof  and any  such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render

remain liable to perform its obligations  hereunder except to the extent of such
unenforceability.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the parties hereto
hereby waive any provision of law that renders any provision  hereof  prohibited

lease agreement and as a complete and exclusive  statement of the terms thereof,
all negotiations,  considerations and representations between the parties hereto
having been incorporated herein and therein. No course of prior dealings between
the parties hereto or their officers,  employees,  agents or Affiliates shall be

Lease or any other  Operative  Document.  Acceptance of, or  acquiescence  in, a
course of  performance  rendered under this or any prior  agreement  between the
parties  hereto or their  Affiliates  shall not be  relevant  or  admissible  to
determine  the meaning of any of the terms of this Lease or any other  Operative
Document.  No  representations,  undertakings,  or agreements  have been made or
relied upon in the making of this Lease other than those  specifically set forth
in the Operative Documents.

         SECTION 18.7 CONSTRUCTION.  This Lease  shall not be  construed  more

hereto have  contributed  substantially  and materially to the  preparation  and
negotiation of this Lease.

         SECTION 18.8 HEADINGS.  The Table of  Contents  and  headings  of the

hereof.

counterparts  as may be convenient  or necessary,  and it shall not be necessary
that the  signatures  of all parties  hereto or thereto be  contained on any one

purposes of  facilitating  the execution of this Lease,  (a) the signature pages
taken from the separate  individually executed counterparts of this Lease may be

<PAGE>

multiple fully executed  counterparts and (b) a signature delivered by facsimile
transmission shall be deemed to be an original  signature for all purposes.  All
executed  counterparts  of this Lease shall be deemed to be  originals,  but all
such  counterparts  taken  together or  collectively,  as the case may be, shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

          SECTION  18.10  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS LEASE SHALL BE GOVERNED  BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND  INTERPRETED  IN ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OHIO,
WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES,  EXCEPT AS TO MATTERS RELATING TO
THE  CREATION OF THE  LEASEHOLD  ESTATES IN THE  RESPECTIVE  PROPERTIES  DEMISED
HEREUNDER  AND THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES WITH RESPECT  THERETO,  WHICH
SHALL BE  GOVERNED  BY AND  CONSTRUED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE
WHEREIN WHICH EACH SUCH PROPERTY IS LOCATED.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN
THE EVENT  THAT THIS LEASE IS DEEMED TO  CONSTITUTE  A  FINANCING,  WHICH IS THE
INTENTION  OF THE  PARTIES,  THE LAWS OF THE  STATE OF OHIO,  WITHOUT  REGARD TO
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES, SHALL GOVERN THE CREATION, TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THE INDEBTEDNESS EVIDENCED HEREBY, BUT THE LIEN CREATED HEREBY AND THE CREATION,
PRIORITY AND THE  ENFORCEMENT OF SAID LIEN SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE  WHEREIN WHICH EACH SUCH PROPERTY AND LIEN
ARE LOCATED.

         SECTION 18.11  DISCHARGE OF LESSEE'S  OBLIGATIONS BY THEIR  AFFILIATES.
The Lessor agrees that performance of any of the Lessee's obligations  hereunder
by one or  more  of the  Lessee's  Affiliates  or one or  more  of the  Lessee's
sublessees  of  the  Leased  Property  or  any  part  thereof  shall  constitute
performance  by the Lessee of such  obligations  to the same extent and with the
same effect hereunder as if such  obligations were performed by the Lessee,  but
no such performance shall excuse the Lessee from any obligation not performed by
it or on its behalf under the Operative Documents.

         SECTION 18.12  LIABILITY  OF  LESSOR  LIMITED.   Except  as  otherwise
expressly  provided below in this SECTION 18.12, it is expressly  understood and
agreed by and between the Lessee, the Lessor and their respective successors and
assigns  that  nothing  herein  contained  shall be  construed  as creating  any
personal  liability  of the  Lessor  or any of its  Affiliates,  or any of their
respective  incorporators,   stockholders,  officers,  directors,  employees  or
agents,  individually or personally,  to perform any covenant, either express or
implied,  contained herein, all such personal liability, if any, being expressly
waived by the Lessee and by each and every Person now or hereafter  claiming by,
through  or under  the  Lessee,  and  that,  so far as the  Lessor or any of its
Affiliates or any of their  respective  incorporators,  stockholders,  officers,
directors,  employees or agents,  individually or personally,  is concerned, the
Lessee and any Person claiming by, through or under the Lessee shall look solely
to, and the  liability of the Lessor  hereunder  shall be limited to, the right,
title and interest of the Lessor in the Leased  Property,  any proceeds from the
Lessor's sale or encumbrance thereof, and any Awards or Loss Proceeds (PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that the Lessee shall not be entitled to any double  recovery) for the
performance of any obligation under this Lease and under the Operative Documents
and the satisfaction of any liability arising therefrom.

         SECTION 18.13 ESTOPPEL  CERTIFICATES.  Each party hereto agrees that at
any time and from time to time during the Lease Term, it will  promptly,  but in
no event later than thirty  (30) days after  request by the other party  hereto,
execute,  acknowledge and deliver to such other party or to the Credit Bank, any
prospective  purchaser (if such prospective purchaser has signed a commitment or
letter of intent to purchase the Leased  Property or any part thereof)  assignee
or  mortgagee  or third party  designated  by such other  party,  a  certificate
stating (i) that this Lease is  unmodified  and in force and effect (or if there
have been modifications, that this Lease is in force and effect as modified, and
identifying the modification agreements),  (ii) the date to which Basic Rent has
been paid,  (iii) whether or not there is any existing  default by the Lessee in
the payment of Basic Rent or any Supplemental Rent hereunder, and whether or not
there is any other  existing  default by either  party  with  respect to which a
notice of default has been served, and, if there is any such default, specifying
the nature and extent  thereof,  (iv)  whether or not, to the  knowledge  of the
signer, there are any setoffs,  defenses or counterclaims against enforcement of
the  obligations  to be  performed  hereunder  existing  in favor  of the  party
executing such  certificate and (v) other matters  concerning the status of this
Lease and any of the Operative Documents to which the Lessee is a party that may
be reasonably  requested;  provided,  however,  that no such  certificate may be
requested unless the requesting party has a good faith reason for such request.

         SECTION 18.14 NO JOINT VENTURE. Any intention to create a joint venture
or partnership  relation  between the Lessor and the Lessee is hereby  expressly
disclaimed.

         SECTION 18.15 NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION.  The acceptance by the Lessor
of any sums from the  Lessee  (whether  as Basic Rent or  otherwise)  in amounts
which are less than the amounts due and payable by the Lessee  hereunder  is not
intended,  nor shall any such  acceptance be construed,  to constitute an accord
and satisfaction of any dispute between the Lessor and the Lessee regarding sums
due and payable by the Lessee hereunder, unless the Lessor specifically deems it
as such in writing.

         SECTION 18.16 NO MERGER.  In no event shall the  leasehold  interests,
estates or rights of the Lessee  hereunder merge with any interests,  estates or
rights of the Lessor in or to the Leased Property, it being understood that such
leasehold interests,  estates and rights of the Lessee hereunder shall be deemed
to be separate and distinct from the Lessor's  interests,  estates and rights in
or to the Leased Property,  notwithstanding that any such interests,  estates or
rights  shall  at any time or times  be held by or  vested  in the same  person,
corporation or other entity.

         SECTION 18.17  SURVIVAL.  The obligations of the Lessee to be performed
under this Lease  prior to the  termination  hereof and the  obligations  of the
Lessee pursuant to ARTICLE IV, ARTICLES XI, XII, XIV, SECTIONS 15.2, 15.3, 15.4,
15.5,  15.8,  ARTICLES XVI and XVII,  and SECTIONS  18.10 and 18.12 hereof shall
survive the  expiration  or  termination  of this Lease.  The  extension  of any
applicable  statute of limitations by the Lessor, the Lessee, the Credit Bank or
any  Indemnitee  shall not affect such  survival.  If any right or option of the
Lessee or the  Lessor  provided  in this  Lease  would,  in the  absence  of the
limitation  imposed by this sentence,  be invalid or  unenforceable  as being in
violation of the rule against  perpetuities or any other rule of law relating to
the vesting of an interest in or the  suspension  of the power of  alienation of
property,  then such right or option shall be exercisable only during the period
which  shall  end  twenty-one

original  of this  Lease  marked  "THIS  COUNTERPART  IS THE  ORIGINAL  EXECUTED
COUNTERPART"  on the signature  page thereof and  containing  the receipt of the
Lessor therefor on or following the signature page thereof shall be the Original
Executed Counterpart of this Lease (the "ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART"). To the
extent that this Lease constitutes chattel paper, as such term is defined in the
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction, no security
interest in this Lease may be created  through the transfer or possession of any
counterpart other than the Original Executed Counterpart.

         SECTION 18.19  TIME OF ESSENCE.  Time is of the essence of this Lease.

         SECTION 18.20  RECORDATION OF MEMORANDUM OF LEASE.  The Lessee will, at

Bank a  non-refundable  letter of credit fee (the  "ANNUAL  FEE") for the period
from and including the Closing Date until the Expiration  Date,  computed at the
rate of 0.75 % per annum, calculated as a percentage of the Stated Amount on the
date of payment of such letter of credit fee. Amounts payable under this Section
2.02(c) shall be payable in advance,  based on a 360-day year,  actual number of
days elapsed, in immediately  available funds, on the Closing Date and quarterly
thereafter on the first day of each January, April, July and October.

         (d)  CHANGE IN LAW. The Lessor  hereby  acknowledges and agrees that if
any  change in any law or  regulation  or in the  interpretation  thereof by any
court  or   administrative   or   governmental   authority   charged   with  the
administration  thereof,  or in GAAP,  shall  either (i) impose,  modify or deem
applicable any reserve,  special deposit or similar  requirement against letters
of credit  issued by, or assets  held by, or  deposits in or for the account of,
the Credit Bank, or (ii) impose on the Credit Bank any other condition relating,
directly  or  indirectly,  to the Letter of Credit,  and the result of any event
referred to in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase the cost to
the Credit Bank of issuing or maintaining  the Letter of Credit (which  increase
in cost shall be determined by the Credit  Bank's  reasonable  allocation of the
aggregate of such cost increase resulting from such event), then the Credit Bank
shall  present  to the  Lessor a  certificate  stating  the amount of the Credit
Bank's  increased costs  reasonably  allocable to the Letter of Credit,  and the
Lessor shall  immediately pay to the Credit Bank, from time to time as specified
by the Credit  Bank in such  certificate,  such  additional  amounts as shall be
sufficient to compensate  for such  increased  cost. A copy of such  certificate
shall be  presented to the Lessor by the Credit  Bank,  and any such  additional
amount to be paid to the Credit Bank shall be immediately due and payable to the
Credit Bank by the Lessor.  The  certificate  referred to  hereinabove  shall be
conclusive as to the amount thereof.

         (e)  OTHER  FEES,  COSTS AND  EXPENSES.  The  Lessor shall also pay all
reasonable fees,  costs and expenses  incurred by the Credit Bank, the Issuer or
the Lessor in connection with this Reimbursement Agreement,  including,  without
limitation,  all reasonable fees and expenses of their  respective legal counsel
incurred in connection herewith from time to time.

         (f)  LETTER OF  CREDIT  FEES.  All  payments  of all fees and  expenses
described  in this  SECTION  2.02 and in SECTION  2.03(k)  below (the "LETTER OF
CREDIT  FEES"),  to be made by the  Lessor to the  Credit  Bank shall be made in
immediately  available funds. With respect to the payment of the Annual Fee, the
Credit Bank shall  notify the Lessor of the amount of such payment not less than
10 days prior to the date upon which such payment is due.

         Section 2.03.         REIMBURSEMENT AND OTHER PAYMENTS.

         (a)  PRINCIPAL,  INTEREST  OR  PROGRAM  EXPENSE  DRAWING.  In the event
of any Principal  Drawing,  Interest  Drawing or Program  Expense  Drawing,  the
Lessor  shall  immediately  pay to the Credit Bank the amount paid by the Credit
Bank to duly honor such  Drawing,  and failure to so  immediately  reimburse the
Credit Bank shall  constitute  a Credit Event of Default  under this  Agreement.
Without  limitation  of the  preceding  sentence,  if such  amount  has not been
previously

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

paid and is outstanding,  such amount shall  constitute a loan to and
indebtedness  of the Lessor to the Credit Bank. If the Lessor does not reimburse
the Credit Bank for such drawing on the same day of the Drawing or if the Lessor
shall  otherwise fail to reimburse the Credit Bank under this SECTION 2.03(a) as
a result of a Principal Drawing as honored, an Interest Drawing as honored, or a
Program Expense Drawing as honored, such unreimbursed amount shall bear interest
until  payment in full of such amount,  and the Lessor shall be obligated to pay
interest  to the Credit  Bank,  payable  on  demand,  or, if demand is not made,
monthly  in  arrears  on the last day of each  month  following  such  Principal
Drawing,  Interest  Drawing  or  Program  Expense  Drawing,  on any and all such
amounts  remaining unpaid at the Overdue Rate.  Accrual of such interest and the
acceptance  of payment of such interest by the Credit Bank thereof on any one or
more  occasions  shall not  constitute  a waiver of any Credit  Event of Default
occurring  upon the failure of the Lessor to  immediately  reimburse  the Credit
Bank for the amount of the Drawing(s)  with respect to which such interest shall
have accrued.

         (b)  REMARKETING  DRAWING.  In the event of any  Remarketing  Drawing,
the amount of such Remarketing Drawing as honored shall constitute a loan to and
indebtedness of the Lessor to the Credit Bank upon the following terms:

              (i)      The amount of any Remarketing Drawing as honored relating
         to interest under the Notes shall be immediately due and payable by the
         Lessor to the Credit Bank and if such amount is not immediately paid to
         the Credit Bank, such amount shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate
         from and after the date such amount  becomes  payable  hereunder.  Such
         interest shall be payable upon demand of the Credit Bank, or, if demand
         is not made, monthly in arrears on the last day of each month.

              (ii) The amount of any Remarketing  Drawing  representing  the
         principal  amount of any Notes not  remarketed (a  "REMARKETING  LOAN")
         shall be repaid as  provided  below.  At any time that any  Remarketing
         Loan is outstanding on any Interest Payment Date, the Credit Bank shall
         apply any payment of principal  received under the Borrower  Promissory
         Note in an amount equal to the principal  amount of Pledged Notes to be
         redeemed  on such date as a  repayment  of the  Remarketing  Loan.  Any
         payments on or of the  purchase  price for the  Pledged  Notes shall be
         applied as a payment of the outstanding amount of the Remarketing Loan.

              (iii) The amount of any Remarketing  Loan, for the period from
         and including the date of the Remarketing  Drawing to but excluding the
         date the amount of such  Remarketing  Loan shall be reimbursed in full,
         shall  be  treated  as a LIBOR  Rate  Loan,  for each  Interest  Period
         relating  thereto,  bearing  interest  at the  Applicable  LIBOR  Rate,
         PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  if any of the circumstances  described in SECTIONS
         2.03 (f)(i) or (iii) shall have  occurred and remain  applicable on the
         date of such  Remarketing  Drawing,  the amount of the Remarketing Loan
         shall be treated as a Base Rate Loan bearing interest at the Base Rate.
         All such  interest  shall be payable to the Credit Bank monthly on each
         Interest Payment Date following the Remarketing Drawing.

         (c)  CONTINUATION OF INTEREST  PERIODS. Five Business Days prior to the
beginning of each Interest Period, the Lessee,  acting for such purpose as agent
of the Lessor,  may request that the

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Credit Bank determine the Adjusted LIBOR Rate applicable to such Interest Period
and the Credit Bank shall notify the Lessee of such  Adjusted  LIBOR Rate.  Each
LIBOR Rate Loan shall  automatically be continued for another Interest Period of
the same  duration,  unless the Lessee  shall  elect to convert  all or any part
thereof  to a Base Rate Loan by written  notice to the Credit  Bank given on any
day which is at least  three  Business  Days  before the  beginning  of the next
succeeding Interest Period. Except to the extent that the Base Rate applies as a
result of any circumstance  described in SECTION 2.03(f) hereof,  the Lessee may
elect to convert  any Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR  Rate Loan,  (i) if a LIBOR Rate
Loan shall be outstanding  at the time of such election,  effective on the first
day of the next succeeding  Interest Period, or (ii) if no LIBOR Rate Loan shall
be  outstanding  at the time of such  election,  effective  on any date at least
three but not more than five Business Days after such  election.  The Lessee may
elect at the end of any Interest  Period with respect thereto to convert a LIBOR
Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  there shall be
only one  Interest  Period  applicable  at any time  for all  Remarketing  Loans
outstanding  hereunder  as LIBOR  Rate  Loans,  except  that any LIBOR Rate Loan
arising from a  Remarketing  Drawing  which occurs  during an existing  Interest
Period shall have a separate  "short" initial Interest Period from and including
the date of the  Remarketing  Drawing  until  the last day of the then  existing
Interest  Period.  Each such  election  made by the Lessee  under  this  SECTION
2.03(c)  shall be made by giving the Credit Bank at least three  Business  Days'
prior irrevocable written notice thereof,  which notice shall specify (1) in the
case of a conversion,  the date of conversion  (which date shall in any event be
the first day of an Interest  Period),  and (2) in the case of a  conversion  or
continuation  affecting less than 100% of the amount of outstanding  Remarketing
Loans, the amounts thereof which are to be LIBOR Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans,
respectively. If, at any time prior to the date a conversion to, or continuation
of, a LIBOR Rate Loan is effective,  the Lessee has received  notice that any of
the circumstances  described in SECTIONS 2.03(f)(i) or (iii) exist, the right of
the Lessee to convert all or a portion of Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans or
to  continue  LIBOR  Rate  Loans  for an  additional  Interest  Period  shall be
suspended until the Lessee receives notice that the  circumstances  causing such
suspension no longer exist.

         (d)  INTEREST PERIOD DETERMINATION. The duration of each Interest
Period  shall be one  month,  except  that any LIBOR  Rate Loan  arising  from a
Remarketing Drawing which occurs during an existing Interest Period shall have a
separate  "short"  initial  Interest  Period from and  including the date of the
Remarketing  Drawing  until the last day of the then existing  Interest  Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION 2.03:

              (i)   No  Interest  Period  may end after the  Scheduled
         Termination  Date,  whether by  acceleration,  mandatory  redemption or
         scheduled maturity; and

              (ii)  Whenever  the  last  day of any  Interest  Period  would
         otherwise  occur on a day other  than a Business  Day,  the last day of
         such Interest  Period shall be extended to occur on the next succeeding
         Business Day, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such extension would cause the
         last  day of such  Interest  Period  to  occur  in the  next  following
         calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period shall occur on the
         next preceding Business Day.

         (e)  APPOINTMENT OF AGENTS FOR INTEREST RATE ELECTIONS. The Lessee may,
from time to time,  and at any time upon notice to the Credit Bank,  appoint one
or more agents for the limited  purpose of making  interest rate elections under
this SECTION 2.03.  The acts of such  agent(s)  shall be

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

binding  upon the Lessee  unless and until such time as the Lessee  shall notify
the Credit Bank that any such agent no longer has the authority to act on behalf
of the Lessee.  Unless and until the Lessee  notifies the Credit Bank otherwise,
each of William T.  Stackhouse  and Karen C.  Turner,  acting  alone,  is hereby
authorized by the Lessee to act as the Lessee's  agent in  accordance  with this
SECTION 2.03.

         (f)  INTEREST RATE PROTECTION.

              (i)  SUSPENSION  OF LIBOR RATE LOANS.  If, with respect to any
         Interest  Period,   the  Credit  Bank  notifies  the  Lessee  that  the
         Applicable  LIBOR Rate for such  Interest  Period  will not  adequately
         reflect  the cost to the Credit  Bank of  maintaining  any  Remarketing
         Loans subject to such  Interest  Period,  the  obligation of the Credit
         Bank to  continue to treat such  Remarketing  Loans as LIBOR Rate Loans
         for an additional  Interest  Period shall be suspended until the Credit
         Bank shall  notify  the  Lessee  that the  circumstances  causing  such
         suspension  no longer exist,  and during the period of suspension  such
         amounts  shall be treated as Base Rate Loans and shall bear interest at
         the Base  Rate as in  effect  from  time to time,  payable  monthly  in
         arrears on each Interest Payment Date during the period of suspension.

              (ii)  INCREASED  COSTS.  Subject to the  provisions of SECTION
         6.11 hereof,  if, due to either (A) the  introduction  of or any change
         (including  any  change by way of  imposition  or  increase  of reserve
         requirements) in or in the  interpretation  of any law or regulation or
         (B) the compliance  with any guideline or request from any central bank
         or other  Governmental  Authority  (whether  or not having the force of
         law),  there  shall be any  increase  in the cost to the Credit Bank of
         agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Remarketing Loan
         at the Applicable LIBOR Rate for any Interest  Period,  then the Lessor
         shall from time to time,  upon  demand by the Credit  Bank,  pay to the
         Credit Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Credit Bank
         for such increased  cost. A certificate in reasonable  detail as to the
         amount of such increased cost,  submitted to the Lessor, with a copy to
         the Lessee, by the Credit Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all
         purposes, absent manifest error.

              (iii) ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
         Reimbursement  Agreement,  if the Credit  Bank shall  notify the Lessee
         that the introduction of or any change in or in the  interpretation  of
         any law or regulation  makes it unlawful,  or any central bank or other
         governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for the Credit Bank
         to perform its obligations  hereunder to make any  Remarketing  Loan at
         the  Applicable  LIBOR  Rate  for  any  Interest  Period  or to fund or
         maintain any  Remarketing  Loans at the  Applicable  LIBOR Rate for any
         Interest Period,  (A) the obligation of the Credit Bank to continue the
         Remarketing Loans for an additional  Interest Period shall be suspended
         until the Credit Bank shall  notify the Lessee  that the  circumstances
         causing  such  suspension  no longer exist and (B) during the period of
         suspension,   the   Remarketing   Loans  then   outstanding   shall  be
         automatically  converted to bear  interest at a rate per annum equal to
         the Base Rate then and thereafter in effect from time to time,  payable
         in  arrears on the last day of each  month  during  which the Base Rate
         applies.
                                      -6-


<PAGE>

         (g)  INTEREST ON OVERDUE AMOUNTS.  If all or a portion of the principal
amount  of or  interest  on any  Remarketing  Loan  shall  not be paid  when due
(whether at the stated  maturity,  by acceleration  or otherwise),  such overdue
amount  shall,  without  limiting the rights of the Credit Bank under ARTICLE V,
bear interest at the Overdue Rate,  but not exceeding the highest rate permitted
by Applicable  Law, in each case from the date of nonpayment  until paid in full
(as well after as before judgment).

         (h)  DISCRETION OF CREDIT BANK AS TO MANNER OF FUNDING. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Reimbursement  Agreement to the contrary,  the Credit Bank
shall be  entitled  to fund and  maintain  its  funding  of all or any part of a
Remarketing  Loan  in any  manner  it  sees  fit,   subject  in all  respects to
Applicable  Law,  it being  understood  however,  that for the  purposes of
this Reimbursement  Agreement all  determinations  hereunder  shall be made as
if the Credit Bank had actually funded and maintained each Remarketing Loan to
which the Applicable LIBOR Rate applies during each Interest Period applicable
thereto through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to such
Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the Applicable LIBOR Rate
for such Interest Period.

         (i) MONTHLY PAYMENTS.  As provided in the Lease, the Lessee is required
to make monthly  payments of Credit Rent on each Rent Payment Date to the Credit
Bank.  All payments of Credit Rent  received by the Credit Bank shall be applied
by it to reimburse the amount of Drawings  under the Letter of Credit and to the
payment of other  amounts  payable  by the Lessor to the Credit  Bank under this
Reimbursement  Agreement.  All of such  payments  are required to be made by the
 required to be made by the
Lessee not later than the Rent Payment Date next preceding any Interest  Payment
Date.  On the  Business  Day prior to any date on which  principal,  interest or
Program Expenses payments are due with respect to the Notes, the Note Trustee is
obligated  to submit a Drawing  on the  Letter of  Credit  for the  amount  due.
Thereafter,  the  Note  Indenture  requires  the  Note  Trustee  to  immediately
reimburse the Credit Bank for such Drawings  from moneys  available  therefor in
the Note Fund, including,  without limitation,  the Remarketing Proceeds Account
of the Note Fund. If on any Rent Payment Date the Note Trustee has  insufficient
funds  available  in the Note Fund to fully  reimburse  the Credit  Bank for the
amount of such Principal, Interest and Program Expense Drawings corresponding to
such payment,  the difference  between the amount available to be so paid to the
Credit Bank from the Note Fund and the payment due shall be immediately  due and
payable  by the  Lessor to the Credit  Bank.  If the  Lessor  fails to make such
payment when due (a "PAYMENT DEFICIENCY"), or, if and to the extent such payment
is to be  applied  to the  reimbursement  of an  Interest  Drawing  or a Program
Expense Drawing, within five Business Days thereafter, the same shall constitute
a Credit  Event of  Default  under this  Reimbursement  Agreement  and,  without
limitation of the foregoing, such amount shall bear interest at the Overdue Rate
from and after the date such  amount  becomes due and  payable  hereunder.  Such
interest  shall be payable upon demand of the Credit Bank,  or, if demand is not
made,  monthly in  arrears  on the last day of each  month.  The  collection  of
interest by the Credit Bank on any one or more occasions  shall not constitute a
waiver of the Credit Event of Default arising upon failure by the Lessor to make
payment to the Credit  Bank when due of the amounts  with  respect to which such
interest accrues.

         (j)  INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  Any change in the Overdue Rate or the Base
Rate  resulting  from a  change  in the Base  Rate  shall  be  effective  on the
effective  date of the  change  in the Base

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

Rate.  The Overdue  Rate shall be computed on the basis of the actual  number of
days elapsed over a year of 360 days.

         (k)  FEES AND  EXPENSES.  The Lessor hereby agrees to pay to the Credit
Bank upon demand  therefor  sums equal to any and all amounts paid by the Credit
Bank for reasonable charges and expenses (including  reasonable attorneys' fees)
attributable  to the Lessor  which the Credit Bank may pay or incur  relative to
the transfer, drawing upon, change in terms, maintenance,  renewal, extension or
cancellation  of the  Letter of  Credit or to any  payment  by the  Credit  Bank
thereunder.  The Lessor  hereby  agrees to pay to the Credit Bank on demand sums
equal  to any and all  amounts  which  the  Credit  Bank  has  paid or  incurred
(including  reasonable  attorneys' fees) relative to the Credit Bank's curing of
any Event of Default  resulting  from the acts or  omissions of the Lessor under
this Agreement or under the Operative Documents.

         (l)  FINAL  PAYMENT.  Subject to the  provisions  of SECTION  6.10, the
Lessor hereby  absolutely,  unconditionally  and  irrevocably  agrees to pay all
amounts due to the Credit Bank pursuant to the provisions of this  Reimbursement
Agreement,  the Borrower Promissory Note and the Operative Documents,  including
without  limitation,  amounts payable pursuant to SECTIONS 2.02 and 2.03 hereof,
on the Expiration Date, or at such earlier time as may be provided for herein.

         (m)  DISCHARGE OF OBLIGATIONS UPON PAYMENT UNDER THE BORROWER
PROMISSORY  NOTE.  Payments made under the Borrower  Promissory Note received by
the  Credit  Bank  shall   discharge   the  Lessor's   obligations   under  this
Reimbursement Agreement to the extent of such payments.

         Section 2.04. PAYMENT ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS.  Whenever any payment to be
made  hereunder  shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day,
such payment may be made on the preceding Business Day, but in no event shall be
made later than the next succeeding  Business Day with interest (if such payment
accrues interest) continuing to accrue thereon until such payment is made.

         Section 2.05. OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS.  As security for all of the Lessor's
obligations  to the  Credit  Bank under  this  Agreement,  and any and all other
obligations, agreements, or indebtedness between the Lessor and the Credit Bank,
the Lessor  shall  execute and deliver  and cause the  Guarantor  to execute and
deliver on the date hereof the Operative  Documents  required to be executed and
delivered as one of the  conditions  precedent to the  obligation  of the Credit
Bank to issue the Letter of Credit.

         Section 2.06. PLEDGE OF REMARKETING NOTES.

         (a)  As security for the payment and performance of all obligations of
the Lessor to the Credit Bank hereunder and under the Borrower  Promissory  Note
and the Security  Documents,  the Lessor hereby agrees that upon the making of a
Remarketing  Drawing with respect to the Notes,  the Note Trustee shall cause to
be  registered  with the  Depository  in the  name of the  Credit  Bank,  as its
designee,  as  requested  by the  Credit  Bank,  and  transferred  to a separate
Depository account of the Note Trustee,  as custodian,  the Notes free and clear
of all other liens and  encumbrances in an aggregate  principal  amount equal to
the amount of such Remarketing  Drawing with respect to the Notes,  less (i) any
portion  of such  Remarketing  Drawing  representing  interest  on the  Notes so

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

transferred,  and (ii) the  amount the Credit  Bank is  reimbursed  by 2:00 p.m.
Columbus,  Ohio  time on the  date of such  Remarketing  Drawing  (the  "Pledged
Notes"),  and the Lessor hereby grants, and consents to the grant of, a security
interest in the Pledged  Notes and in the  proceeds  thereof to the Credit Bank.
Pledged  Notes  registered  with the  Depository  in the name of the Credit Bank
shall be for the  benefit  of the  Lessor  as  pledgor  and the  Credit  Bank as
pledgee.  If a Depository is not used,  the Lessor  agrees that the  Remarketing
Agent shall  deliver such Pledged Notes to the Note Trustee and the Note Trustee
shall register such Pledged Notes in the name of the Credit Bank for the benefit
of the Lessor,  as pledgor  and in the name of the Credit  Bank as pledgee  with
Credit Bank's  endorsement of the Pledged Notes to the order of the Credit Bank,
and deliver such Pledged Notes to the Credit Bank or its  designated  custodian.

         (b)  The Lessor further agrees to the Note Trustee entering into its
registration  books as the address to which payments of interest with respect to
Pledged Notes are to be sent, the Credit Bank's address for notices  pursuant to
Section 7.04 hereof as in effect from time to time.

         (c)  If the Lessor shall become  entitled to receive or shall receive
any Pledged  Notes,  any payment of interest  with respect to the Pledged  Notes
from the Note Trustee,  or any and all other proceeds  thereof,  it shall accept
any such  items as the  Credit  Bank's  agent,  shall hold them in trust for the
Credit Bank,  and shall  deliver them  forthwith to the Credit Bank in the exact
form  received,  with the Lessor's  endorsement  to the order of the Credit Bank
when necessary,  to be held by the Credit Bank,  subject to the terms hereof, as
security  for the  payment  and  performance  of all  obligations  of the Lessor
hereunder,  under the Borrower Promissory Note and under the Security Documents,
except that the Credit Bank shall credit all  payments and proceeds  received by
the Credit Bank directly  against the Lessor's  obligations  under Sections 2.02
and 2.03 of this Agreement.

         (d)  All  principal  and interest  paid on the Pledged Notes shall be
retained by the Credit Bank (or if  received  by the Lessor  shall be  forthwith
delivered by it to the Credit Bank in the original form received) and applied by
the Credit  Bank to the  payment of amounts  due the Credit Bank from the Lessor
hereunder, under the Borrower Promissory Note and under the Security Documents.

         (e) If the Lessor makes or causes to be made to the Credit Bank a
prepayment or payment of a Remarketing  Drawing pursuant to Section 2.03 hereof,
or the  Remarketing  Agent resells  Pledged  Notes on behalf of the Lessor,  the
Credit Bank agrees to release  from the lien of this  Agreement  and to instruct
the Note Trustee by telephone  (confirmed  in writing) to cause the  appropriate
transfer of Pledged Notes on the books of the Depository (or, if a Depository is
not used, to deliver to the Lessor or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be,
Pledged  Notes  endorsed in blank  without  recourse) in an aggregate  principal
amount  equal to the  amount of such  prepayment  or  payment  with  respect  to
principal so made, or the principal amount of the Pledged Notes so resold to the
extent that the proceeds of such resale are  delivered  to the Credit Bank.  Any
such payment or prepayment of the Remarketing Drawing shall constitute a payment
or prepayment of the Borrower Promissory Note for all purposes hereof and of the
Borrower Promissory Note.

         (f) In  addition to the rights and  remedies granted to the Credit Bank
in this Agreement,  the Credit Bank shall have all of the rights and remedies of
a secured  party under the  applicable

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

Uniform  Commercial  Code and such other rights and remedies as are granted to a
secured  party in similar  situations to the extent of the  security  interest
granted  under  paragraph  (a) above.  In addition, if Pledged  Notes are issued
in "book  entry  form",  the Credit Bank shall be a "Registered  Pledgee" as

of any outside attorneys employed by the Credit Bank to collect such deficiency.

ARTICLE  III,  any  payment  received  by the Lessor  which is to be paid to the
Credit Bank pursuant hereto or for which provision as to the application thereof
is made in an Operative  Document but not  elsewhere in this Section  shall,  if
received by Lessor,  be received by it in trust and paid forthwith to the Credit

Person and for the purpose for which such  payment was made in  accordance  with

Letter of Credit Liabilities (the "REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT").  Pending application
as herein  provided,  such funds shall be invested in Permitted  Investments  as
directed by the Lessee.  Interest earned on the moneys held in the Reimbursement
Account  shall  be for  the  account  of the  Lessee  and  shall  be paid to and
deposited  by the Credit Bank in the  Reimbursement  Account.  Funds held in the
Reimbursement  Account shall be withdrawn and applied by the Credit Bank on each

                                   ARTICLE IV
                  THE LESSOR; EXERCISE OF REMEDIES UNDER LEASE

         Section  4.01.  COVENANTS  OF LESSOR.  So long as either or both of the
Borrower  Promissory  Note  and/or  any  Letter  of  Credit  Liabilities  remain
outstanding and unpaid, or any other amount is owing to Credit Bank hereunder or
under the other Operative  Documents,  the Lessor shall promptly pay all amounts
payable by it under this  Reimbursement  Agreement  and the Borrower  Promissory

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Note in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and shall duly perform each
of its obligations under this Reimbursement  Agreement,  the Borrower Promissory
Note and the  Operative  Documents.  The Lessor  agrees to provide to the Credit
Bank a copy of each  estoppel  certificate  that the Lessor  proposes to deliver
pursuant  to  SECTION  18.13 of the Lease at least  five (5) days  prior to such
delivery and to make any corrections thereto reasonably  requested by the Credit
Bank prior to such delivery.  The Lessor shall keep the Leased Property free and
clear of all Lessor  Liens.  The Lessor  shall not reject any sale of the Leased
Property  pursuant to SECTION  15.6 of the Lease  unless (a) an Event of Default
shall have occurred and remain  outstanding,  (b) the Lease Balance  exceeds the
sum of the net proceeds of such sale plus the Recourse  Deficiency Amount or (c)
the Credit Bank  consents to such  rejection.  In the event that the Credit Bank
directs the Lessor to reject any sale of the Leased Property pursuant to SECTION
15.6(xi) of the Lease,  or the Credit Bank,  acting through the power granted in
the Assignment of Lease and Rents,  rejects such sale in the name of the Lessor,
the Lessor  agrees to take such  action as Credit  Bank  reasonably  requests to
effect a sale or other  disposition  of the Leased  Property.  The Lessor  shall
reject any offer to purchase the Leased  Property  received  pursuant to SECTION
15.6 of the  Lease at the  direction  of the  Credit  Bank as  provided  in said
Section.

         Section  4.02.  LESSOR  OBLIGATIONS  NONRECOURSE;  PAYMENT FROM CERTAIN
LEASE  OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN PROCEEDS OF LEASED PROPERTY ONLY. All payments to
be made by the  Lessor in  respect  of the  Letter of  Credit  Liabilities,  the
Borrower Promissory Note, the Note Indenture, the Security Documents, the Letter
of Credit  and this  Reimbursement  Agreement  shall be made  only from  certain
payments  received under the Lease and proceeds of the Leased  Property and only
to the extent that the Lessor or the Credit Bank shall have received  sufficient
payments  from  such  sources  to  make  payments  in  respect  of the  Borrower
Promissory  Note,  reimbursement  of  Drawings  under the  Letter of Credit  and
repayment of the Contribution, in accordance with ARTICLE III hereof. The Credit
Bank agrees  that it will look solely to such  sources of payments to the extent
available for  distribution  to the Credit Bank as herein provided and that none
of the Lessor, or any of its partners,  or Cornerstone Capital  Corporation,  or
the Issuer, or any of their respective organizers, incorporators,  stockholders,
partners, members, directors,  managers, employees, officers or agents, shall be
personally  liable to the Credit Bank for any amount payable  hereunder or under
the Borrower  Promissory  Note.  Except to the extent of such revenues and rents
payable  pursuant  to the  Lease  or  such  proceeds  from  the  sale  or  other
disposition of the Leased Property, nothing in this Reimbursement Agreement, the
Borrower  Promissory Note or any other Operative  Document shall be construed as
creating any liability (other than for willful  misconduct) of the Lessor to pay
any sum or to perform any covenant, either express or implied, in or pursuant to
this  Reimbursement  Agreement,  the  Borrower  Promissory  Note  or  any  other
Operative  Document (all such liability,  if any, being expressly  waived by the
Credit  Bank).  The  Credit  Bank,  on behalf of itself and its  successors  and
assigns,  agrees in the case of any  liability of the Lessor  hereunder or under
any of the Operative  Documents  (except for such liability  attributable to its
willful  misconduct) that it will look solely to those certain payments received
under the Lease and those  certain  proceeds of the Leased  Property;  provided,
however,  that the  Lessor  (but not its  partners,  the  Issuer or  Cornerstone
Capital  Corporation,  or any of  their  respective  organizers,  incorporators,
stockholders,  partners, members, managers,  directors,  employees, officers and
agents) shall in any event be liable with respect to (i) the removal of Lessor's
Liens or liabilities,  (ii) the Lessor's willful  misconduct or (iii) failure to
turn over payments the Lessor has received in  accordance  with ARTICLE III; and
provided,

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

further that the foregoing  exculpation  of the Lessor shall not be deemed to be
an exculpation of the Lessee or any other Person.

         Section 4.03.     EXERCISE OF REMEDIES UNDER LEASE.

         (a)  EVENT OF DEFAULT. With respect to any Event of Default as to which
notice  thereof  by the  Lessor  to the  Lessee  is a  requirement  to cause the
underlying  Default to become an Event of Default,  the Lessor  shall not at any
time give such notice except upon receipt of instructions  from the Credit Bank;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the  Lessor  agrees to give such  notice to the Lessee
promptly upon receipt of a written  request by the Credit Bank, and  irrevocably
authorizes the Credit Bank to give any such notice on Lessor's behalf.

         (b)  ACCELERATION  OF  LEASE  BALANCE.  When an Event  of  Default  has
occurred and remains  outstanding,  the Lessor, upon the direction of the Credit
Bank,  shall exercise  remedies under ARTICLE XIV of the Lease to demand payment
in full of the Lease  Balance  by the Lessee (a "LEASE  BALANCE  ACCELERATION").
Following a Lease Balance Acceleration, the Lessor shall consult with the Credit
Bank  regarding  actions to be taken in response  to such Event of Default.  The
Lessor shall not,  without the prior written  consent of Credit Bank,  and shall
(subject to the provisions of this Section),  if so directed by the Credit Bank,
do any of the following: commence eviction or foreclosure proceedings, or file a
lawsuit  against the Lessee  under the Lease,  or sell the Leased  Property,  or
exercise  other  remedies  against the Lessee under the  Operative  Documents in
respect of such Event of Default; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that any payments received
by the Lessor shall be immediately  paid over to the Credit Bank and distributed
in accordance with ARTICLE III.  Notwithstanding any such consent,  direction or
approval  by the Credit Bank of any such action or  omission,  the Lessor  shall
have no obligation to follow such  direction if the same would,  in the Lessor's
reasonable  judgment,  require  the Lessor to expend its own funds or expose the
Lessor to liability,  expense,  loss or damages unless and until the Credit Bank
advances to the Lessor an amount or offers the Lessor an indemnity in an amount,
in either case, which is sufficient,  in Lessor's reasonable judgment,  to cover
such liability,  expense, loss or damage. Lessor agrees that an indemnity of the
Credit Bank that is unlimited in amount shall be acceptable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  on and after the Release Date,  the Credit Bank shall have no rights
to the Leased  Property or any proceeds  thereof,  the Credit Bank shall have no
rights to direct or give  consent  to any  actions  with  respect  to the Leased
Property and the proceeds thereof,  the Lessor shall have absolute discretion as
to the  exercise  of  remedies  with  respect  to the Leased  Property,  and the
proceeds thereof, including,  without limitation, any foreclosure or sale of the
Leased Property,  and the Lessor shall have no liability to the Credit Bank with
respect to the  Lessor's  actions or failure to take any action with  respect to
the Leased Property.

                       CREDIT EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES

         Section 5.01.  CREDIT EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  Each of the following  events
shall  constitute  a Credit  Event of Default  (whether  any such event shall be
voluntary  or  involuntary  or come about or be effected by  operation of law or
pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment,  decree or order of any court or
any order,  rule or regulation  of any  Governmental  Authority),  and each such
Credit Event of Default shall continue so long as, but only as long as, it shall
not have been remedied:

         (a)  The  Lessor  shall  fail  to pay to the  Credit  Bank  for
distribution  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of  ARTICLE  III any  amount
received by the Lessor pursuant to the Lease or the Participation  Agreement, if
and to the extent  that the Credit  Bank is entitled to such amount or a portion

to the Lessor, the Guarantor and the Lessee;

         (d)  The default by Lessor in the making of (i) any payment in  respect

written  notice of such  default to the  Lessor,  the  Guarantor  and the Lessee

Scheduled  Termination  Date),  or (ii) any  payment in respect of the  Borrower
Promissory  Note,  the  Letter  of  Credit  Liabilities  or  this  Reimbursement
Agreement due on or after the Scheduled Termination Date;

         (e)  The default in any  material  respect by the Lessor in the

Issuer in the case of such default by the Issuer) of written notice thereof from
the Credit Bank;

         (f)  The  Lessor or the Issuer  shall (i) admit in writing  its

Bankruptcy Laws;

         (g)  Insolvency  proceedings or a petition under any Bankruptcy Laws
shall be filed against the Lessor or the Issuer and not dismissed within 60 days
from the date of its filing, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall enter an
order or decree  appointing,  without  the  consent of the Lessor or the Issuer,
respectively, a receiver of the Lessor or the Issuer, respectively, or the whole
or a substantial part of any of its respective property and such order or decree
shall  not be  vacated  or set  aside  within 60 days from the date of the entry
thereof;

when made and shall not have been cured within 30 days of receipt by the Lessor,
the  Guarantor  and the Lessee (and by the Issuer in the case of such default by
the Issuer) of written notice thereof from the Credit Bank.

         Section 5.02.     CREDIT EVENT OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES.

         (a)  When a Credit Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
shall not have been  specifically  waived  pursuant to SECTION 6.01 hereof,  the
Credit Bank may do any one or more of the following:

              (i)      Direct the Trustee to accelerate  the maturity of the
         Notes and to draw so much of the Letter of Credit as is available to be

         and  Rents,  and shall  have and may  exercise  any and all  rights and
         remedies  available  under the UCC or any other  provision of law or in
         equity,  subject,  however,  to the  rights  of the  Lessee  under  the
         Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreements.

         (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 4.03, when a Credit
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,  the Credit Bank shall have the
right and power to exercise all rights of the Lessor under the Lease pursuant to
the terms and in the manner  provided for in the  Assignment  of Lease and Rents
and in the Mortgages.

         (c)  Except as expressly provided above, no remedy under this Section
is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any
other remedy provided under this Section or under the other Operative  Documents
or otherwise  available at law or in equity.  The exercise by the Credit Bank of
any one or more of such remedies  shall not preclude the  simultaneous  or later
exercise of any other  remedy or remedies.  No express or implied  waiver by the
Credit Bank of any Credit Event of Default  shall in any way be, or be construed
to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Credit Event of Default. The failure
or delay of the Credit Bank in

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

exercising any rights  granted it hereunder or under any of the other  Operative
Documents upon any occurrence of any of the contingencies set forth herein shall
not constitute a waiver of any such right upon the continuation or recurrence of
any such  contingencies  or  similar  contingencies  and any  single or  partial
exercise of any  particular  right by the Credit Bank shall not exhaust the same
or constitute a waiver of any other right provided herein or in any of the other
Operative Documents.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Agreement,  the Borrower  Promissory Note nor any terms hereof or thereof may be
amended,  supplemented  or modified  except in accordance with the provisions of
SECTION 8.4 of the Participation Agreement.

         Section 6.02.  NOTICES. Unless otherwise specified herein, all notices,

         Section 6.03.  NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE  REMEDIES.  No failure to exercise
and no delay in exercising,  on the part of the Credit Bank, any right,  remedy,
power or privilege  hereunder,  shall operate as a waiver  thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right,  remedy,  power or privilege  hereunder
preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,  remedies,  powers and privileges
herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers
and privileges provided by law.

         Section 6.04.  SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  This  Reimbursement  Agreement
shall be binding  upon and inure to the benefit of the  Lessor,  the Credit Bank
and their  respective  successors  and  permitted  assigns.  The Credit Bank may
assign  to any  financial  institution  all  or any  part  of,  or any  interest
(undivided  or divided)  in, its rights and  benefits  under this  Reimbursement
Agreement,  and to the extent of that  assignment  such assignee  shall have the
same rights and  benefits  against the Lessor  hereunder as it would have had if
such assignee were the Credit Bank, PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no such assignment
by the Credit Bank shall affect or alter the Letter of Credit or the obligations
of the Credit Bank thereunder, and PROVIDED FURTHER, that without the consent of
the  Lessee,  the Credit  Bank shall not  assign  more than 50% of its  economic
interest in and under the Letter of Credit, this Reimbursement Agreement and the
other Operative Documents.

         Section  6.05.  COUNTERPARTS.   This  Reimbursement  Agreement  may  be
executed in any number of counterparts as may be convenient or necessary, and it
shall not be necessary  that the  signatures of all parties hereto or thereto be
contained on any one counterpart  hereof or thereof.  Additionally,  the parties
hereto  agree  that  for  purposes  of   facilitating   the  execution  of  this
Reimbursement   Agreement,   (a)  the   signature   pages  taken  from  separate
individually  executed  counterparts  of  this  Reimbursement  Agreement  may be
combined  to form  multiple  fully  executed  counterparts  and (b) a  facsimile
transmission  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  original  signature.  All  executed
counterparts  of this  Reimbursement  Agreement shall be deemed to be originals,
but all

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

such  counterparts  taken together or collectively,  as the case may be,
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 6.06.  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT AND THE
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF GEORGIA.

         Section 6.07.  SURVIVAL AND  TERMINATION  OF AGREEMENT.  All covenants,
agreements,  representations  and warranties made herein and in any certificate,
document or statement  delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall
survive the  execution  and  delivery of this  Reimbursement  Agreement  and the
Borrower  Promissory Note and shall continue in full force and effect so long as
the Borrower  Promissory  Note or any amount  payable to Credit Bank under or in
connection with this Reimbursement  Agreement or the Borrower Promissory Note is
unpaid.

         Section 6.08.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Reimbursement  Agreement and the
other Operative  Documents set forth the entire  agreement of the parties hereto
with respect to its subject matter,  and supersede all previous  understandings,
written or oral, with respect thereto.

         Section 6.09.  SEVERABILITY. The parties hereto intend and believe that
each provision in this Agreement  comports with all applicable local,  state and
Federal laws and judicial decisions. However, if any provision or provisions, or
if any portion of any provision or provisions,  in this Agreement are found by a
court of law to be in  violation  of any  applicable  local,  state  or  Federal
ordinance,  statute, law, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy,
and if such court should  declare such portion,  provision or provisions of this
Agreement to be illegal,  invalid,  unlawful,  void or unenforceable as written,
then it is the intent of the parties  hereto  that such  portion,  provision  or
provisions shall be given force and effect to the fullest possible extent,  that
the  remainder of this  Agreement  shall be  construed  as if such  provision or
provisions  were not  contained  herein  and that the  rights,  obligations  and
interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect.

         Section 6.10.  NO RECOURSE; LIABILITY OF LESSOR LIMITED.

         (a)  Except as provided in SECTION 4.02 hereof, no recourse shall be
had for any claims under this  Reimbursement  Agreement  against any  organizer,
incorporator, shareholder, partner, member, manager, officer, or director, past,
present  or  future,  of the Lessor or its  Affiliates,  or against  Cornerstone
Capital  Corporation,  either  directly  or  through  the  Lessor  or any of its
partners,  whether by virtue of any  constitution,  statute or rule of law or by
the  enforcement of any  assessment or penalty or otherwise,  all such liability
being, by acceptance  hereof and as part of the consideration for the acceptance
hereof, expressly waived and released.

         (b)  Except as otherwise expressly provided below in this Section, it
is expressly  understood and agreed by and between Credit Bank, Lessor and their
respective  successors  and  assigns  that  nothing  herein  contained  shall be
construed as creating any personal liability of Lessor or any of its Affiliates,
or any of their respective organizers,  incorporators,  stockholders,  partners,
members, managers,  officers,  directors,  employees or agents,  individually or
personally,  to perform

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

any covenant,  either express or implied,  contained  herein,  all such personal
liability,  if any, being expressly  waived by Credit Bank and by each and every
Person now or hereafter  claiming by, through or under Credit Bank, and that, so
far as Lessor or any of its Affiliates,  or any of their respective  organizers,
incorporators,  stockholders,  partners, members, managers, officers, directors,
employees or agents,  individually or personally, are concerned, Credit Bank and
any Person  claiming by,  through or under Credit Bank shall look solely to, and
the  liability  of Lessor  hereunder  shall be limited to, the right,  title and
interest  of Lessor in the Lease and the Rent  payable  thereunder,  the  Leased
Property, any proceeds from Lessor's sale or encumbrance thereof, and any Awards
or Loss Proceeds (PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that Credit Bank shall not be entitled to
any double  recovery) for the performance of any obligation under this Agreement
and under the Operative  Documents and the satisfaction of any liability arising
therefrom.

         Section 6.11.  LIMITATION  ON INTEREST.  Any provision to the contrary
contained  in this  Reimbursement  Agreement  or in any of the  other  Operative
Documents  notwithstanding,  it is expressly  provided  that in no case or event
shall the aggregate of (i) all interest  payable by the Lessee or the Lessor and
(ii) the  aggregate  of any  other  amounts  accrued  or paid  pursuant  to this
Reimbursement  Agreement or any of the other  Operative  Documents,  which under
applicable  laws are or may be deemed to  constitute  interest,  ever exceed the
maximum rate of interest  which could  lawfully be  contracted  for,  charged or
received.  In this connection,  it is expressly stipulated and agreed that it is
the intent of the  Lessee,  the Lessor and the Credit Bank to contract in strict
compliance with the applicable  usury laws of the State and of the United States
(whichever  permit the higher rate of interest) from time to time in effect.  In
furtherance thereof, none of the terms of this Reimbursement Agreement or any of
the other  Operative  Documents  shall ever be construed to create a contract to
pay, as consideration for the use,  forbearance or detention of money,  interest
at a rate in  excess of the  maximum  contract  interest  rate  permitted  to be
contracted for,  charged or received by the applicable laws of the United States
or the State  (whichever  permit the higher rate of interest).  The Lessee,  the
Lessor and any other parties now or hereafter becoming liable for payment of any
indebtedness under this Reimbursement Agreement or any other Operative Documents
shall never be liable for  interest  in excess of the  maximum  rate that may be
lawfully contracted for or charged under the laws of the State and of the United
States   (whichever   permit  the  higher  rate  of  interest).   If  under  any
circumstances the aggregate amounts paid include amounts which by law are deemed
interest  which would exceed the maximum amount of interest which could lawfully
have been contracted for, charged or received,  the parties  stipulate that such
amounts  will be deemed to have been paid as a result of an error on the part of
the parties,  and the party receiving such excess payment shall  promptly,  upon
discovery  of such  error or upon  notice  thereof  from the party  making  such
payment, refund the amount of such excess or at the Credit Bank's option, credit
such excess against any unpaid  principal  balance owing.  To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, all amounts contracted for, charged or received for
the use,  forbearance,  or detention of money shall, to the extent  permitted by
applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full
term of the Letter of Credit.  The  provisions of this Section shall control all
of the Operative Documents.

         Section 6.12.  SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION;  WAIVERS. Subject to SECTION
6.13 hereof,  each party  hereto  hereby  irrevocably  and  unconditionally  (i)
submits for itself and its property in any legal action or  proceeding  relating
to  this  Reimbursement  Agreement  or  any  other  Operative  Document,  or for
recognition  and  enforcement  of  any  judgment  in  respect  thereof,  to  the
non-

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

exclusive  general  jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Georgia,  the
courts of the United States of America for the Northern  District of Georgia and
appellate  courts  from any  thereof,  (ii)  consents  that any such  action  or
proceedings may be brought to such courts,  and waives any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any court
or that such  action or  proceeding  was  brought in an  inconvenient  court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same,  (iii)  agrees that service of process in
any such  action or  proceeding  may be  effected  by mailing a copy  thereof by
registered  or  certified  mail (or any  substantially  similar  form of  mail),
postage  prepaid,  to such party at its  address set forth in SECTION 8.2 of the
Participation  Agreement  or at such other  address  of which the other  parties
hereto  shall have been  notified  pursuant to SECTION 8.2 of the  Participation
Agreement,  and (iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other  manner  permitted  by law.  EACH PARTY,  TO THE
EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY  LAW,  HEREBY  VOLUNTARILY,   KNOWINGLY,  IRREVOCABLY  AND
UNCONDITIONALLY  WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY  PARTICIPATE  IN RESOLVING  ANY
DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE,  AMONG OR BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH,  RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO
THE  RELATIONSHIP   ESTABLISHED  AMONG  THE  PARTIES  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  THIS
REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT,  ANY OTHER  OPERATIVE  DOCUMENT OR ANY OTHER  DOCUMENT
EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO.
THIS  WAIVER  SHALL NOT IN ANY WAY  AFFECT,  WAIVE,  LIMIT,  AMEND OR MODIFY THE
CREDIT  BANK'S  ABILITY TO PURSUE ANY REMEDIES  CONTAINED IN THIS  REIMBURSEMENT
AGREEMENT,  OR THE OTHER  OPERATIVE  DOCUMENTS.  THIS  PROVISION  IS A  MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT TO THE CREDIT BANK TO PROVIDE THE LOAN PURSUANT TO THIS REIMBURSEMENT
AGREEMENT.

         Section 6.13.  [RESERVED]

         Section 6.14.  PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS. The Lessor shall make each of
its  payments  due under this  Agreement  not later  than  12:30 p.m.  (Atlanta,
Georgia,  time) on the date when due in  lawful  money of the  United  States of
America to the Credit Bank at its address  referred to in Section 6.02 hereof in
immediately  available funds.  The Lessor hereby  authorizes the Credit Bank, if
and to the extent payment is not made when due hereunder, to charge from time to
time against the Lessor's account with the Credit Bank any amount so due. Except
as otherwise  specifically provided in this Agreement,  computations of interest
and fees  hereunder  shall be made by the Credit  Bank on the basis of a year of
360 days and the actual  number of days  (including  the first day but excluding
the last day) elapsed.  Where the character or amount of any asset, liability or
item of income or expense is required to be determined,  or any consolidation or
other  accounting  computation  is required to be made,  for the purpose of this
Reimbursement Agreement,  such determination or calculation shall, to the extent
applicable and except as otherwise  specified herein, be made in accordance with
GAAP.

         Section 6.15.  SETOFF.

         (a)  In addition to any rights and  remedies of the Credit Bank
provided by law, the Credit Bank shall have the right,  without  prior notice to
the Lessor,  any such notice being expressly  waived by the Lessor to the extent
permitted by applicable  law, on the  occurrence of any Credit Event of Default,
to set off and apply against any indebtedness,  whether matured or unmatured, of
the Lessor to the Credit  Bank,  any  amount  owing from the Credit  Bank to the
Lessor (whether matured or unmatured),  at or at any time after the happening of
any such Credit  Event of Default,  and such right of setoff may be exercised by
the Credit Bank against the Lessor or against a  debtor-in-possession,  assignee
for the benefit of  creditors,  receiver or  execution,  judgment or  attachment
creditor of the Lessor,  or against anyone else claiming  through or against the
Lessor or such  debtor-in-possession,  assignee  for the  benefit of  creditors,
receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact
that such  right of set off shall not have been  exercised  by the  Credit  Bank
before the  occurrence  of any such  Credit  Event of  Default.  The Credit Bank
agrees promptly to notify the Lessor after any such setoff and application  made
by the Credit Bank,  PROVIDED  THAT failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such setoff and application.

         (b)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of paragraph (a) of this SECTION
6.15,  the Credit Bank hereby  agrees to waive the exercise of such right of set
off and application with respect to the Lessor's obligations existing under this
Agreement  at  any  time  after   commencement   of  a  case  in  bankruptcy  or
reorganization naming the Lessor as debtor.

         Section 6.16.  FURTHER  ASSURANCES.  The Lessor  agrees to do such
further  acts and  things  and to execute  and  deliver to the Credit  Bank such
additional assignments,  agreements,  powers and instruments, as the Credit Bank
may  reasonably  require or deem  advisable to carry into effect the purposes of
this  Agreement or to better assure and confirm unto the Credit Bank its rights,
powers and remedies hereunder.

         Section 6.17.  HEADINGS.  Section  headings  and captions in this
Agreement are included  herein for  convenience  of reference only and shall not
constitute  a part of this  Agreement  for any other  purpose  and are not to be
considered  as  defining  or  limiting  in any way the  scope or  intent  of the
provisions of this Agreement.

         Section  6.18.  NO THIRD PARTY  BENEFICIARIES.  The  provisions of this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit and  responsibility  of the parties hereto,
their  successors  and  assigns  (but  only to the  extent  such  assignment  is
permitted herein) and shall not benefit or affect any third party.

         D.  DEFINED  TERMS.  Unless a clear  contrary  intention  appears,
terms defined  herein have the respective  indicated  meanings when used in each
Operative Document.

         "ACCELERATION"  means  (i)  the  automatic   acceleration  of  Lessee's
obligation to purchase  Lessor's interest in the Leased Property pursuant to the
provisions of SECTION 15.3 of the Lease,

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

or (ii) the acceleration of Lessee's  responsibilities  to purchase the Lessor's
interest in the Leased  Property  pursuant to the provisions of SECTION 14.1 and

         "ADJUSTED  LIBOR RATE"  means the rate per annum equal to the  quotient
obtained by dividing the LIBOR Rate by the  percentage  obtained by  subtracting
from 100% the applicable LIBOR Reserve Percentage on the date of calculation.

         "AFFILIATE"  means,  with  respect  to any  Person,  any  other  Person
directly or indirectly  controlling,  controlled by or under common control with
such Person. For purposes of this definition,  the term "CONTROL" (including the
correlative  meanings  of the terms  "CONTROLLING,"  "CONTROLLED  BY" and "UNDER
COMMON CONTROL WITH"), as used with respect to any Person, means the possession,
directly or  indirectly,  of the power to direct or cause the  direction  of the
management  policies of such  Person,  whether  through the  ownership of voting
securities or by contract or otherwise; provided, however, (but without limiting
the  foregoing)  that no pledge of voting  securities of any Person  without the
current right to exercise  voting rights with respect thereto shall by itself be
deemed to constitute control over such Person.

         "AFTER-TAX  BASIS" means (i) with respect to any payment to be received
by an Indemnitee (which, for purposes of this definition,  shall include any Tax
Indemnitee),  the amount of such payment  supplemented  by a further  payment or
payments so that,  after  deducting  from such  payments the amount of all Taxes
(net of any current  credits,  deductions or other Tax benefits arising from the
payment by the Indemnitee of any amount,  including Taxes, for which the payment
to be received is made)  actually  imposed  currently on the  Indemnitee  by any
Governmental  Authority or taxing  authority with respect to such payments,  the
balance of such payments  shall be equal to the original  payment to be received
and (ii) with respect to any payment to be made by any Indemnitee, the amount of
such  payment  supplemented  by a further  payment or  payments  so that,  after
increasing  such  payment  by the  amount of any  current  credits  or other Tax
benefits realized by the Indemnitee under the laws of any Governmental Authority
or taxing authority resulting from the making of such payments,  the sum of such
payments  (net of such  credits  or  benefits)  shall be  equal to the  original
payment to be made; provided,  however, for the purposes of this definition, and
for purposes of any payment to be made to either the Lessee or a Tax  Indemnitee
on an after-tax  basis, it shall be assumed that federal,  state and local taxes
are payable at the highest combined  marginal federal and state statutory income
tax rate  (taking  into  account the  deductibility  of state  income  taxes for
federal income tax purposes)  applicable to  corporations  from time to time and
that  such  Indemnitee  or the  Lessee  has  sufficient  income to  utilize  any
deductions,  credits (other than foreign tax credits,  the use of which shall be

undertake  to perform or  discharge,  any  obligation,  duty or liability of the
Lessor  under  the  Lease or of the  Lessor  under  any of the  other  Operative
Documents,  or under or by reason of this  Assignment and the Lessor does hereby
waive  any and all  liability,  loss or damage  which  may or might be  asserted

its part to  perform or  discharge  any of the terms,  covenants  or  agreements

It is further  understood and agreed that this  Assignment  shall not operate to

name of the Lessor or  otherwise,  which the Credit Bank may deem  necessary  or
appropriate to protect and preserve the right,  title and interest of the Credit
Bank in and to such Rent and other sums and  security  intended  to be  afforded
hereby.  The powers  granted to the Credit Bank in this  Section 3 are,  and are
intended to be,  exclusive to the Credit Bank, and the Lessor shall not take any

Credit Bank on or before the due date thereof.

         SECTION  5.    ALLOCATION   PURSUANT   TO   REIMBURSEMENT    AGREEMENT.
Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein to the contrary,  any and all Basic
Rent, Supplemental Rent, payments pursuant to ARTICLES IV, XI, XIV and XV of the
Lease,  payments in respect of the Lease Balance and of the Recourse  Deficiency
Amount or otherwise,  purchase proceeds or avails, income, Awards, Loss Proceeds
and other sums payable by the Lessee under the Lease or by the  Guarantor  under
the Guaranty paid to or received or collected by or on behalf of the Credit Bank
shall be paid,  allocated and  distributed  pursuant to the terms of, and in the
order of priority provided for in, ARTICLE III of the Reimbursement Agreement

         SECTION 6.     EXCLUDED RIGHTS.  Notwithstanding  anything contained
herein to the contrary, and regardless of whether or not a Loan Event of Default
shall occur or exist,  all Excluded Rights are hereby retained by the Lessor and
are not assigned to the Credit Bank.

         SECTION 7.     IRREVOCABILITY;  SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUMENTS. The Lessor
agrees that the assignment  made hereby and the designation and direction to the
Lessee set forth in  SECTION 4 are  irrevocable,  and that the Lessor  will not,
while said  assignment is in effect or thereafter  until the Lessee has received
from the Credit Bank written notice of the termination of said assignment,  make
any other assignment, designation or direction inconsistent herewith, and agrees
that any  assignment,  designation or direction  inconsistent  herewith shall be
void.  In  addition,  the Lessor  shall from time to time,  upon  request of the
Credit  Bank,  execute  all  instruments  of  further  assurance  and  all  such
supplemental instruments as the Credit Bank may reasonably specify.

         SECTION 8.     AMENDMENTS OR TERMINATION OF THE LEASE.  Except as
otherwise  permitted  under  this  SECTION  8 or  SECTIONS  6.1  or  8.4  of the
Participation Agreement, the Lessor shall not enter into any agreement amending,
supplementing,  hypothecating,  waiving,  discharging or  terminating  the LEASE
(other  than solely  involving  Excluded  Rights),  the  Mortgages  or any other
agreement,  document or instrument  hereby  assigned by the Lessor to the Credit
Bank.

         SECTION 9.     LESSEE'S CONSENT AND AGREEMENT. The consent and
agreement by the Lessee to the  provisions  of this  Assignment  is evidenced by
their execution of this Assignment in the spaces  indicated  therefor at the end
of this Assignment;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the parties hereto agree that the
LEASE and the Participation  Agreement shall control as to the respective rights
and obligations of the Lessor and the Lessee.

         SECTION 10.    REMEDIES  CUMULATIVE.  Each right,  power and remedy of
the Credit Bank provided for in this Assignment or now or hereafter  existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise  shall be cumulative  and concurrent
and shall be in addition to every other right,  power or remedy  provided for in
this Assignment or in any other Operative  Document or now or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise  and the exercise or beginning of
the  exercise  by the Credit Bank of any one or more of such  rights,  powers or
remedies shall not preclude the further  exercise thereof or the simultaneous or
later  exercise  by the Credit Bank of any or all such other  rights,  powers or
remedies.  No failure or delay on the part of the Credit  Bank to  exercise  any
such right, power or remedy (including,  without limitation, the granting by the
Credit Bank of

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

consent to any action by the Lessor)  shall  operate as a waiver thereof.  The
Lessor  stipulates  that  the  remedies  at law in  respect  of any  default  or
threatened default by the Lessor in the performance of or compliance with any of
the terms of this  Assignment are not and will not be adequate,  and that any of
such terms may be specifically  enforced by a decree for specific performance or
by an injunction against the violation of any terms or otherwise.

         SECTION 11.    MISCELLANEOUS.

         (a)  All notices, requests, offers, consents and other instruments
given pursuant to this Assignment  shall be delivered in accordance with SECTION
8.2 of the Participation  Agreement.  In addition, the Credit Bank shall provide
the Lessee in a timely fashion with a copy of any such instruments  given by the
Credit Bank to the Lessee hereunder;  provided,  however, that the Credit Bank's
failure to provide  the Lessee with any such copy shall not nullify or delay the
effectiveness of any such instrument.

         (b)  This Assignment shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by, the respective  successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
The headings to the various paragraphs of this Assignment have been inserted for
convenient  reference  only and shall not  modify,  define,  limit or expand the
express provisions of this Assignment. Neither this Assignment nor any provision
hereof may be amended,  modified,  waived,  discharged or terminated orally, but
only by an  instrument  signed by the parties  hereto.  If any provision of this
Assignment or any  application  thereof shall be invalid or  unenforceable,  the
remainder of this  Assignment and any other  application of such provision shall
not be affected thereby.

         (c)  THIS ASSIGNMENT SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA  EXCEPT FOR
ISSUES WHICH ARE MANDATORILY  SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH ANY PART
THE LEASED PROPERTY IS LOCATED, WHICH ISSUES SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAWS OF THE  STATE IN WHICH  SUCH PART OF THE
LEASED PROPERTY IS LOCATED.

         (d)  This  Assignment may be executed in any number of  counterparts as
may  be  convenient  or  necessary,  and it  shall  not be  necessary  that  the
signatures of all parties hereto or thereto be contained on any one  counterpart
hereof or thereof.  Additionally,  the parties hereto agree that for purposes of
facilitating  the execution of this  Assignment,  (i) the signature  pages taken
from separate  individually  executed  counterparts  of this  Assignment  may be
combined  to form  multiple  fully  executed  counterparts  and (ii) a signature
delivered by facsimile transmission shall be deemed to be an original signature.
All executed  counterparts of this  Assignment  shall be deemed to be originals,
but all such  counterparts  taken together or collectively,  as the case may be,
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         (e) Upon payment in full of the indebtedness and obligations secured by
this  Assignment and the  Reimbursement  Agreement and  performance of all other
obligations  secured hereby and thereby,  the Credit Bank shall, at the Lessor's
expense, do, execute,  acknowledge and deliver each and every deed,  conveyance,
transfer  and  release  necessary  or proper to  evidence  the

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

release of this Assignment  whereupon this Assignment and the assignment created
hereby shall terminate and be of no further force or effect.

         (f)  Except as otherwise expressly provided below in this CLAUSE (f),
It is  expressly  understood  and agreed by and between  the Lessor,  the Credit
Bank, and their respective  successors and assigns that nothing herein contained
shall be  construed  as  creating  any  liability  (other  than for  intentional
misrepresentation  or willful misconduct) of the Lessor or any of its Affiliates
or any of its or their respective officers, directors,  members,  incorporators,
stockholders, partners, venturers, trustees, beneficiaries,  employees, managers
or  agents,  individually  or  personally,  whether  past,  present or future to
perform any covenant,  either  express or implied,  contained  herein,  all such
liability,  if any,  being  expressly  waived by the Credit Bank and by each and
every Person now or hereafter claiming by, through or under the Credit Bank, and
that, so far as the Lessor or any of its  Affiliates or any of their  respective
officers, directors, incorporators, stockholders, partners, venturers, trustees,
beneficiaries,  employees or agents,  individually or personally,  is concerned,
the Credit  Bank and any Person  claiming  by,  through or under the Credit Bank
shall look solely to the right,  title and  interest of the Lessor in the Leased
Property  and  any  proceeds  from  the  Lessor's  sale or  encumbrance  thereof
(provided,  however,  that the Credit  Bank shall not be  entitled to any double
recovery) for the performance of any obligation  under this Assignment and under
the Operative  Documents and the satisfaction of any liability arising therefrom
(other than for intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct).

         THIS LIMITED GUARANTY, dated as of March 31, 2000 (this "GUARANTY"), is
made by MINNESOTA POWER,  INC., a Minnesota  corporation (the  "GUARANTOR"),  to
SUNTRUST BANK, a banking  corporation  duly organized and validly existing under
the laws of the State of Georgia (the "CREDIT  BANK"),  and ASSET  HOLDINGS III,
L.P., an Ohio limited partnership (the "LESSOR").  Capitalized terms used herein
and  not  defined  herein  shall  have  the  meanings  ascribed  to  them in the
Participation  Agreement  dated as of the date hereof  among the  Lessor,  ADESA
Corporation,  an  Indiana  corporation  (the  "LESSEE"),  the  Credit  Bank  and
Cornerstone Funding Corporation I, a Delaware corporation (the "ISSUER"), as the
same may be amended from time to time (the "PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, as contemplated by the Participation Agreement, the Lease, the
Reimbursement  Agreement,  the Borrower  Promissory Note and the other Operative
Documents,  at the request of the Lessee, (i) the Lessor has agreed to lease the
Leased  Property  to the  Lessee  and the  Lessee has agreed to lease the Leased
Property  from the Lessor  pursuant to the Lease,  (ii) the Issuer has agreed to
issue and sell its Floating Rate Notes, Series 2000A, in the aggregate principal
amount of $28,373,000  and lend the proceeds from the sale thereof to the Lessor
to  provide  refinancing  for  certain  indebtedness  incurred  by the Lessor in
connection  with its  acquisition  of the Leased  Property,  (iv) the Lessor has
agreed  to  invest  from  its  own  equity  resources  an  amount  equal  to the
Contribution  in the  principal  amount of  $877,515.46,  to pay  certain  costs
related to the  transactions  contemplated by the Operative  Documents,  (v) the
Credit Bank has agreed to issue the Letter of Credit to secure  repayment of the
Notes upon  compliance  with the other  terms and  conditions  of the  Operative
Documents,  and (vi) the Lessor  has in the  Reimbursement  Agreement  agreed to
reimburse the Credit Bank for Drawings under the Letter of Credit and to pay all
Letter of Credit Liabilities.

         WHEREAS,  as  security  for its  obligations  under  the  Reimbursement
Agreement,  the Lessor has,  INTER ALIA,  assigned  all of its right,  title and
interest in the Lease to Credit Bank  pursuant  to the  Assignment  of Lease and
Rents dated of even date herewith; and

         WHEREAS,  for the  purposes  of this  Guaranty,  the  term  "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS"  means at any time, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
1 below, any or all of the following,  without  duplication:  (i) payment to the
Lessor and the Credit Bank of, and performance of, all of the obligations of the
Lessee  under  the  Lease,  the  Assignment  of Lease  and  Rents  and the other
Operative  Documents,  including  but not  limited  to the  payment of Rent (the
amount of which includes,  without limitation or duplication,  the amount of all
Drawings,  all Letter of Credit Fees and all Letter of Credit Liabilities),  the
payment of the Lease Balance and the payment of the Recourse  Deficiency Amount,
at the times and in the circumstances under which the payment of such amounts is
provided for in the Lease and the other Operative  Documents,  (iii) the payment
and performance of the obligations of the Lessee to pay the applicable  purchase
price and purchase the Leased  Property  pursuant to the  provisions of ARTICLES
XI,  XIV and XV of the  Lease,  and  (iv) the  payment  and  performance  of all
obligations  of the  Lessee  under  the  Participation  Agreement  and the

<PAGE>

other Operative  Documents,  all without  duplication and in accordance with the
respective  terms and provisions of the Lease, the  Participation  Agreement and
the other Operative Documents; and

         WHEREAS,  the Guarantor  intends this Guaranty to be an inducement  (i)
for the Credit  Bank to issue the Letter of Credit,  which the Credit Bank would
be unwilling to do if the  Guarantor  did not execute and deliver this  Guaranty
and (ii) for the  Lessor to invest  the  Contribution  and enter into the Lease,
which the Lessor would be unwilling to do if the  Guarantor  did not execute and
deliver this Guaranty.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the premises and intending to be
legally  bound by this  Guaranty,  the  Guarantor  hereby  agrees to be bound as
follows:

         1.  The Guarantor  hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Credit Bank
and the  Lessor  the due and  punctual  payment  and  performance  of all of the
Guaranteed Obligations,  and further unconditionally  guarantees and agrees with
the  Credit  Bank and the  Lessor  that all sums due or payable by the Lessee in
respect of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  together with any other sums which may
become due and payable by the Lessee  pursuant to any  Operative  Document  with
respect to the Guaranteed  Obligations,  but only to the extent  provided in the
Operative Documents, whether the same shall accrue before or after the filing of
a proceeding  under the Bankruptcy Code, shall be promptly paid in full (a) when
due,  whether  at stated  maturity,  or on the  Lease  Termination  Date,  or by
acceleration or otherwise,  in accordance with the provisions of such Guaranteed
Obligations  and of the  Operative  Documents or (b) upon the  occurrence  of an
Event of Default hereunder.

         Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein  contained,  it is
expressly  understood  and agreed  that this  Guaranty  shall not  constitute  a
guaranty of an amount in excess of the Recourse  Deficiency  Amount in the event
that the Lessee shall (A) exercise the Remarketing Option in accordance with the
provisions  of SECTION  15.6 of the Lease,  (B)  timely  comply  with all of the
obligations  and satisfy  all of the  conditions  set forth in SECTION  15.6 (i)
through (xiii) of the Lease, including,  without limitation,  the timely payment
in full of the Recourse  Deficiency Amount pursuant to the provisions of SECTION
15.6(x) of the Lease and (C) return and  surrender  the Leased  Property  to the
Lessor or, if applicable, the independent purchaser thereof, pursuant to, and in
compliance with, the provisions of SECTION 15.8 of the Lease.

         This  Guaranty  shall  be  irrevocable,  and in  all  events  shall  be
continuing,  unconditional and absolute, and if for any reason any such sums, or
any part thereof,  shall not be paid promptly when due, the Guarantor  shall pay
the same to the Credit  Bank to and in  accordance  with the  provisions  of the
Guaranteed  Obligations and the Operative Documents,  regardless of any defenses
or rights of set-off or counterclaim, regardless of whether the Credit Bank, the
Lessor or any  successor  in  interest  of either of them,  shall have taken any
steps to enforce its or their rights against the Lessee, the Lessor or any other
Person,  to collect such sums, or any part thereof,  and regardless of any other
condition or  contingency.  The Guarantor also agrees to pay to the Credit Bank,
the Lessor and such  successors  in interest  such  further  amounts as shall be
sufficient  to cover the costs and  expense of  collecting  such  sums,  or part
thereof,  or of  otherwise  enforcing  this  Guaranty,  including,  in any case,
reasonable fees of their respective  attorneys for all services rendered in that
connection.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

         If the  Guarantor  shall be  required by  Applicable  Law to deduct any
charges from or in respect of any sum payable  hereunder to the Credit Bank, (i)
the sum payable by the Guarantor  shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after  making  all  required  deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to
additional sums payable under this paragraph) the Credit Bank receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have been  entitled to receive from the Lessee and the
Lessor, as the case may be, under the Operative Documents had no such deductions
been  made,  (ii) the  Guarantor  shall  make  such  deductions,  and  (iii) the
Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation  authority
or other authority in accordance with Applicable Law.

         The obligations of the Guarantor  hereunder shall be unaffected by, and
shall remain in full force and effect in the event that,  a bankruptcy  court or
other  court of  competent  jurisdiction  shall at any time  determine  that the
transactions  represented by the Lease and the other Operative  Documents (i) do
not constitute true leasing  transactions,  (ii) shall be treated as a financing
or loan transaction or shall otherwise be recharacterized, or (iii) shall in any
respect be held to be unenforceable in accordance with their respective terms.

         2.  The Guarantor  hereby  unconditionally  (a) waives any  requirement
that the Credit  Bank  first  make  demand  upon,  or seek to  enforce  remedies
against,  any other  Person or any of the  collateral  or property of such other
Person  before  demanding  payment  from,  or seeking to enforce  this  Guaranty
against, the Guarantor;  (b) covenants that this Guaranty will not be discharged
except by complete  satisfaction by indefeasible  payment in cash in full of all
payment obligations of Guarantor contained in the Guaranteed  Obligations and in
the Operative Documents with respect to the Guaranteed  Obligations;  (c) agrees
that, to the extent  permitted by law, this Guaranty shall remain in full effect
without  regard to, and shall not be affected or  impaired  by, any  invalidity,
illegality,  irregularity  or  unenforceability  in  whole  or in  part  of  the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  any other Operative Document (and the Guarantor hereby
waives any defense relating to the enforceability of the Operative  Documents or
any  provision  contained  therein),  or any  limitation of the liability of the
Guarantor  thereunder,  or any  limitation  on the  method  or terms of  payment
thereunder  which  may now or  hereafter  be  caused or  imposed  in any  manner
whatsoever;  (d) waives diligence,  presentment and protest with respect to, and
any notice of default in, the payment of any amount at any time payable under or
in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or any of the Operative Documents;
and (e) agrees  that each and every  right,  power and remedy  given  under this
Guaranty or any other Operative  Document shall be cumulative and not exclusive,
and be in addition to all other  rights,  powers and  remedies  now or hereafter
granted or otherwise existing.

         3.  Notwithstanding  any  payment or payments  made by the Guarantor
hereunder or any set-off or  application of funds of the Guarantor by the Credit
Bank, until all of the Guaranteed  Obligations have been  indefeasibly  paid and
performed in full,  the Guarantor  shall not (a) be entitled to be subrogated to
any of the rights of the Credit Bank against the Lessee, the Lessor or any other
guarantor or in any  collateral  security or guaranty or right of offset held by
the Credit  Bank for the  payment  of any sums due in respect of the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  or (b) seek any reimbursement or contribution from the Lessee, the
Lessor or any other guarantor in respect of any payment,  set-off or application
of funds made by the Guarantor hereunder.

         4.  The  obligations, undertakings and  conditions to be  performed or
observed by the Guarantor  under this Guaranty shall not be affected or impaired
by  reason  of the  happening  from

                                      -3-

governmental or non-governmental body:

             (a) An Event of Default as defined in ARTICLE XIII of the Lease.

             (b) Any  default by the  Guarantor in the payment of any amount due

         this Guaranty or any other agreement,  report,  certificate,  financial
         statement or other  instrument  referred to herein and furnished to the
         Credit Bank in connection  herewith shall prove incorrect or misleading
         in any material respect when made and shall remain  unremedied for five
         days after written notice to the Guarantor.

             (d) The  Guarantor   shall  default  in  the  performance  or
         observance  of any  agreement or covenant  contained  in this  Guaranty
         (other than a covenant or  agreement or default in the  performance  or
         observance  of  which  is  elsewhere  in this  Section  6  specifically
         addressed)  and such  default  shall  continue  for a period of 10 days
         after written notice to the Guarantor.

             (e) The filing by the Guarantor of a petition for the  appointment
         of a trustee with respect to itself or any of its property.

             (f) The making by the Guarantor of an assignment for the benefit of
         creditors.

             (g) The  commencement by  the Guarantor of a case  in bankruptcy or
         insolvency or for compromise, adjustment or other relief under the laws
         of the United States or of any state relating to the relief of debtors.

             (h) The  failure of the  Guarantor  to obtain  the  dismissal,
         within 60 days after service upon the  Guarantor of any case  commenced
         against  the  Guarantor  (i) for the  appointment  of a trustee for the
         Guarantor,  of any of its property or (ii) in  bankruptcy or insolvency
         or for  compromise,  adjustment  or other  relief under the laws of the
         United States or of any state relating to the relief of debtors.

             (i) The failure of the Guarantor to generally pay its debts as such
         debts become due.

             (j) The making, or the attempted making, by the Guarantor of a
         fraudulent  conveyance  within the  meaning of the  Uniform  Fraudulent
         Conveyances Act.

             (k) Any  "Event of  Default"  (as  defined  in any such  other
         Operative  Document)  under  any of the  Lease or any  other  Operative
         Document  (after  the  expiration  of all  applicable  cure and  notice
         periods) and such "Event of Default" shall continue for a period of ten
         (10) days after the Guarantor's  receipt of written notice thereof from
         the Credit Bank or the Lessor.

         7.  Notice of acceptance of this  Guaranty and notice of the execution
             and delivery of any other instrument  referred to in this Guaranty,
             are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

         8.  (a) If any  Event  of  Default  (other  than an  Event  of  Default
         specified  above in Section  6(e) through (h) hereof  inclusive)  shall
         have  occurred  and be  continuing,  the Credit  Bank may,  in its sole
         discretion  (i) require the Trustee to draw upon the full amount of the
         Letter of Credit then  available  to be drawn as provided in the Letter
         of

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

         Credit  and the  Indenture,  (ii)  declare  all  obligations  of the
         Guarantor  under  this  Guaranty  to be  immediately  due and  payable,
         whereupon  all  such  obligations  shall  become  immediately  due  and
         payable,  and (iii)  proceed  first and directly  against the Guarantor
         under this Guaranty without  proceeding  first or concurrently  against
         the Lessee,  the Lessor or any other guarantor,  without exhausting any
         other remedies it may have (including, without limitation, any remedies
         under the Reimbursement  Agreement or the other Operative Documents) or
         without resorting to any other security held by the Credit Bank.

             (b) If any Event of Default  specified  above in Section  6(e)
         through (h) hereof  inclusive  shall occur (i) all  obligations  of the
         Guarantor  under this  Guaranty  shall  immediately  and  automatically
         become due and payable,  without  notice of any kind,  all of which are
         hereby  expressly  waived,  and (ii) the Credit  Bank may,  in its sole
         discretion, (A) require the Trustee to draw upon the full amount of the
         Letter of Credit then  available  to be drawn as provided in the Letter
         of Credit and the Indenture, and (B) proceed first and directly against
         the  Guarantor  under  this  Guaranty   without   proceeding  first  or
         concurrently  against  the Lessee,  the Lessor or any other  guarantor,
         without  exhausting any other remedies it may have (including,  without
         limitation,  any remedies  under the  Reimbursement  Agreement or other
         Operative Documents) or without resorting to any other security held by
         the Credit Bank.

         9.  In the event any payment by the Lessee, the Lessor or the Guarantor
to the Credit Bank or the Lessor,  as the case may be, is held to  constitute  a
preference under the bankruptcy laws, or if for any other reason the Credit Bank
or the Lessor, as the case may be, is required to refund by a court of competent
jurisdiction  any such  payment or pay the amount  thereof to any other  Person,
such  payment to the Credit  Bank or the Lessor,  as the case may be,  shall not
constitute or effect a release of Guarantor  from any liability  hereunder,  but
this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case
may be, to the extent of any such  payment,  as though such payment had not been
made in the first instance,  and Guarantor agrees to pay an amount equal to such
payment to the Credit Bank or the Lessor,  as the case may be. The provisions of
this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Guaranty.

         10. The Guarantor does hereby represent and warrant that:

             (a) It  is a  corporation  duly organized,  existing and in good
         standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; it has
         corporate  power to enter into and perform all  agreements  on its part
         herein contained; the execution,  delivery and performance by Guarantor
         of this  Guaranty  has been  authorized  by all  necessary  and  proper
         corporate  action;  the  execution  and  delivery by  Guarantor of this
         Guaranty  does  not,  and  its  performance  of the  agreements  herein
         contained  will not,  contravene  or  constitute  a  default  under any
         agreement,  indenture,  commitment,  provision  of  its  organizational
         documents, or Requirements of Law to which it is a party or by which it
         is or may be bound,  the failure of which could  reasonably be expected
         to have a material adverse effect on the performance of its obligations
         hereunder.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

             (b) This Guaranty is a valid,  legal and binding obligation of the
         Guarantor,   subject  only  to  certain  exceptions  in  the  event  of
         bankruptcy and the application of general principles of equity.

             (c) The waivers,  representations,  warranties, covenants, and
         agreements  contained in this  paragraph  and this Guaranty are for the
         benefit of and may be  enforced  by the Credit  Bank and the Lessor and
         their respective successors and assigns.

             (d) The Guarantor has such knowledge of the business and financial
         affairs of the Lessee as the Guarantor  deems necessary to evaluate the
         risks of executing and delivering  this Guaranty to the Credit Bank and
         the Lessor,  and is capable of  evaluating  such risks by reason of the
         Guarantor's  knowledge and  experience.  All  information has been made
         available to the  Guarantor  by the Lessee  which is necessary  for the
         evaluation of such risks. The Guarantor has consulted with and received
         advice from legal counsel and  financial  advisers with respect to such
         risks  and the  Guarantor  has not  relied,  and  shall not rely in the
         future, upon the Lessor or the Credit Bank to conduct any investigation
         of the Lessee's financial  condition or business prospects or to notify
         the  Guarantor  now or in the future of any  adverse  information  with
         respect  thereto which could increase the  Guarantor's  risk under this
         Guaranty.

         11. The Guarantor agrees to repay, to  the extent  included within  the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  all monies,  including  but not limited to  reasonable
attorneys'  fees, paid by the Lessor in defense of any action  asserted  against
the  Lessor  by  the  Lessee,  as a  debtor-in-possession,  or by a  trustee  in
bankruptcy in a proceeding brought under 11 U.S.C. Section 547 of the Bankruptcy
Code for the  recovery  of monies  received  by the Lessor  from the Lessee as a
result of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder. The Guarantor further agrees to
repay any  monies  paid by the  Lessor in  settlement  of any such  action or in
satisfaction of any judgment rendered against the Lessor in such an action.

         12. The Guarantor hereby subordinates any  and all claims which it now
has, or in the future may acquire, as a creditor of any of the Lessee or Lessor,
to the prior payment and satisfaction in full of this Guaranty. If, prior to the
payment  and  satisfaction  of  this  Guaranty,  the  Guarantor  would,  without
reference  to the  provisions  of this  Section  12, be  entitled to receive any
payment on account of any claim of the  Guarantor  against  the Lessee or any of
its Subsidiaries,  or the Lessor, all such payments shall be made instead to the
Credit Bank until the  Guaranteed  Obligations  have been paid and  satisfied in
full, and the Guarantor hereby so directs. If the Guarantor receives any payment
on  account  of any  claim of the  Guarantor  against  the  Lessee or any of its
Subsidiaries,  or the Lessor,  the Guarantor shall immediately pay the same over
to  the  Credit  Bank  to be  applied  to the  payment  or  satisfaction  of the
Guaranteed Obligations,  if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless an "Event
of Default" (as defined in the  Participation  Agreement) has occurred,  and has
not been  either  waived or  acknowledged  to have been  cured in writing by the
Credit Bank,  the Guarantor  may receive and retain  payments from the Lessee or
any of its  Subsidiaries  on account of any claim of the  Guarantor  against the
Lessee or any such Subsidiary.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

         13. This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until payment
in full of all sums payable under and in respect of the Guaranteed  Obligations,
and all Operative  Documents with respect to the  Guaranteed  Obligations by the
Guarantor  hereunder  and the  performance  in full  of all  obligations  of the
Guarantor in accordance with the provisions of this Guaranty. This Guaranty is a
guaranty of payment and not of collection merely.

         14. In case any provision of this Guaranty or any  application  thereof
shall  be  invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable,   the  validity,  legality  and
enforceability  of the remaining  provisions and any other  application  thereof
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

         15. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE IN THIS GUARANTY AND THE TERMS HEREIN SHALL
BE SO  CONSTRUED.  This  Guaranty  shall be binding upon the  Guarantor  and its
successors and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable  by, the Credit
Bank and its successors and assigns as to the obligations  respectively owed and
guaranteed hereunder.  This Guaranty may not be changed,  waived,  discharged or
terminated  orally,  but only by a statement in writing  signed by the Guarantor
and the  Credit  Bank,  in  compliance  with the  requirements  set forth in the
Participation  Agreement.  This  Guaranty  may be enforced as to any one or more
defaults either separately or cumulatively.  THIS GUARANTY SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF GEORGIA.

         16. All notices,  demands,  requests,  consents  approvals and other
instruments  hereunder  shall  be  given in the  manner  and at the  appropriate
address set forth in the  Participation  Agreement  or at such other  address as
such party shall designate by notice to each of the other parties hereto.

         17. This  Guaranty is  made by the Guarantor solely to the Credit Bank
and the Lessor  and their  respective  successors  and  assigns,  and may not be
relied upon by any other person, firm, corporation or entity.

         18. The Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation,  renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the amounts  which the  Guarantor is obligated to
pay  hereunder  and notice of or proof of  reliance by the Credit Bank upon this
Guaranty or  acceptance  of this  Guaranty.  The  indebtedness  evidenced by the
Guaranteed  Obligations  shall  conclusively  be deemed  to have  been  created,
contracted, incurred, renewed, extended, amended or waived in reliance upon this
Guaranty,  and all  dealings  between  the  Guarantor  and the Credit Bank shall
likewise be  conclusively  presumed to have been had or  consummated in reliance
upon this Guaranty.

         19. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  herein or in any other
Operative  Document,  any payment by the  Guarantor  to the Lessor or the Credit
Bank pursuant to any other Operative Document shall discharge  dollar-for-dollar
the related  obligations of the Guarantor to the Credit Bank hereunder,  and any
payment by the  Guarantor to the Credit Bank shall  discharge  dollar-for-dollar
the related  obligations of the Guarantor to the Lessor or the Credit Bank under
any other Operative Document.

         20. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and  unconditionally (i) submits
for itself and its property in any legal action or  proceeding  relating to this
Guaranty or any other Operative

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Document, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof,
to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Georgia,
the courts of the United States of America for the Northern  District of Georgia
and  appellate  courts from any thereof,  (ii)  consents that any such action or
proceedings may be brought to such courts,  and waives any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any court
or that such  action or  proceeding  was  brought in an  inconvenient  court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same,  (iii)  agrees that service of process in
any such  action or  proceeding  may be  effected  by mailing a copy  thereof by
registered  or  certified  mail (or any  substantially  similar  form of  mail),
postage  prepaid,  to such party at its  address set forth in SECTION 8.2 of the
Participation  Agreement  or at such other  address  of which the other  parties
hereto  shall have been  notified  pursuant to SECTION 8.2 of the  Participation
Agreement  and (iv) agrees that nothing  herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner  permitted by law. The Guarantor,  to the
extent permitted by law, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right
to have a jury  participate  in  resolving  any  dispute,  whether  sounding  in
contract,  tort, or otherwise,  among or between the parties  hereto arising out
of,  in  connection  with,   related  to,  or  incidental  to  the  relationship
established  among the  parties  in  connection  with this  Guaranty,  any other
Operative  Document or any other  document  executed or delivered in  connection
herewith or the  transactions  related hereto.  This waiver shall not in any way
affect,  waive,  limit,  amend or modify the  Guarantor's  ability to pursue any
remedies contained in this Guaranty,  the other Operative Documents or any other
agreement or document related hereto.

         21. The Guarantor  acknowledges that (i) Lessor has assigned its rights
under this Guaranty to the Credit Bank  pursuant to the  Assignment of Lease and
Rents,  and the Lessor and the Credit Bank, by their  respective  acceptances of
this Guaranty, direct the Guarantor to make payments directly to the Credit Bank
of amounts  which at any time may become  due to the Lessor  hereunder  and (ii)
pursuant to the Assignment of Lease and Rents, the power to enforce the Lessor's
rights hereunder has been irrevocably granted to the Credit Bank pursuant to the
power of attorney set forth in SECTION 3 of the Assignment of Lease and Rents.
