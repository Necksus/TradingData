Note 2.   Regulatory Matters

FPSC Refund Order in  Connection  with 1991 Rate Case.  Responding  to a Florida
Supreme Court  decision  addressing  the issue of  retroactive  ratemaking  with
respect  to another  company,  in March  1996 the FPSC  voted to  reconsider  an
October 1995 order  (Refund  Order) which would have  required  Florida Water to
refund about $13 million,  which includes  interest,  to customers who paid more
since  October  1993  under  uniform  rates  than they  would  have  paid  under
stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order, the collection through a surcharge of
the $13  million  from  customers  who paid  less  under  uniform  rates was not
permitted.  The Refund Order was in response to the Florida First District Court
of  Appeals  (Court of  Appeals)  reversal  in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order
which  imposed  uniform  rates  for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in
Florida.  With "uniform  rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the
same rates for water and wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative
to  "stand-alone"  rates which are calculated  based on the cost of serving each
service area. The FPSC  reconsidered the Refund Order, but in August 1996 upheld
by a 3 to 2 vote its decision to order refunds  without  offsetting  surcharges.
Florida  Water filed an appeal of this  decision  with the Court of  Appeals.  A
decision on the appeal is anticipated by the end of 1997. The Company  continues
to believe  that it is  improper  for the FPSC to order a refund to one group of
customers  without  permitting  recovery of a similar  amount from the remaining
customers  since the Court of  Appeals  affirmed  the  Company's  total  revenue
requirement  for  operations  in  Florida.  No  provision  for  refund  has been
recorded. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1 million rate
increase  in June 1995.  On October  30, 1996 the FPSC issued its final order in
the Florida Water rate case.  The final order  established  water and wastewater
rates for all customers of Florida Water  regulated by the FPSC.  The new rates,
which became effective on September 20, 1996, resulted in an annualized increase
in revenue of approximately $11.1 million.  This increase included,  and was not
in addition  to, the $7.9  million  increase in  annualized  revenue  granted as
interim  rates  effective  on January  23,  1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate
structure  called  "capband,"  which replaces uniform rates. With capband rates,
areas with similar cost of service are grouped into one of a number of rate 
bands, and all customers within a given band are charged the same rate. This 
rate structure is designed so that a customer's bill will not exceed a certain
"cap" unless the customer's usage exceeds an assumed level. On  November  1,
1996  Florida  Water  filed with the Court of Appeals an appeal of the FPSC's
final order  seeking  judicial  review of issues relating to the amount of
investment in utility facilities recoverable in rates from current customers.
Other parties to the rate case also filed appeals with the Court of Appeals 
regarding the FPSC's final order. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of this matter.  Florida law provides  that the new rates be
implemented, subject to refund, while the order is under appeal.

Florida  Jurisdictional  Issues.  In June 1995 the FPSC issued an order assuming
jurisdiction over Florida Water facilities  statewide following an investigation
of all of Florida Water's facilities.  Several counties in Florida appealed this
FPSC  decision  to the Court of Appeals.  In December  1996 the Court of Appeals
issued an opinion reversing the FPSC order. In January 1997 the Court of Appeals
denied motions for rehearing. No further appeals were filed.

Hernando  County  Rates.  On  February  14,  1997 the FPSC issued an order which
requires  Florida Water to charge rates to customers in Hernando County based on
a modified  stand-alone rate structure instead of the uniform rate structure set
by the FPSC in the 1991 rate case and  currently in effect.  The  imposition  of
this rate  structure  would reduce  Florida  Water  revenue by $1.6 million on a
prospective annual basis. On February 28, 1997 Florida Water filed a motion with
the FPSC for  reconsideration  of this order.  Florida Water's February 28, 1997
request  for  reconsideration  of this order was heard on May 6, 1997,  at which
time the FPSC  indicated  the request  would be denied.  Florida  Water plans on
appealing  this  denial  when the  written  order is  received.  Since the order
involves a rate reduction,  Florida Water believes that,  under FPSC rules,  the
FPSC  must  grant a stay of this  rate  reduction  pending  the  outcome  of any
appeals. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

Since Hernando County has assumed jurisdiction over Florida Water's rates within
the county,  Florida  Water filed a rate  increase in April 1997 as requested by
Hernando County.  Final rates resulting in $8 million in annualized revenues for
water and wastewater services, if approved by Hernando County, would result in a
$124,000 net annual  increase from current  revenue  levels.  By law, the County
must take action by June 1997 on Florida  Water's  request for interim rates.

Note 3.   Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

The Company has a contract to purchase power and energy from Square Butte. Under
the terms of the contract which extends  through 2007, the Company is purchasing
71 percent of the output from a generating  plant which is capable of generating
up to 470 MW.  Reductions  to about 49 percent of the output are provided for in
the contract and, at the option of Square  Butte,  could begin after a five-year
advance notice to the Company.

The cost of the power  and  energy is a  proportionate  share of Square  Butte's
fixed obligations and variable  operating costs,  based on the percentage of the
total  output  purchased by the Company.  The annual  fixed  obligations  of the
Company to Square Butte are $20.1 million from 1997 through  2001.  The variable
operating costs are not incurred unless  production  takes place. The Company is
responsible  for paying all costs and  expenses  of Square  Butte if not paid by
Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the Company are
absolute and unconditional whether or not any power is actually delivered to the
Company.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
           Condition and Results of Operations

Minnesota  Power  has  operations  in  four  business  segments:   (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
services,  which include water and wastewater services; (3) automotive services,
which include auctions, a finance company and an auto transport company; and (4)
investments,   which  include  a  securities  portfolio,  a  21  percent  equity
investment  in  a  financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and  real  estate
operations.

Earnings per share of common stock for the quarter  ended March 31, 1997 were 52
cents  compared to 61 cents for the quarter  ended March 31,  1996.  Earnings in
1997 reflect a significant  increase in automotive services due to the expansion
of ADESA's  automobile  auction operations and AFC's dealer floor plan financing
business.   1997  earnings  also  reflect  a  solid  performance  from  electric
operations,  consistent performance by the portfolio and reinsurance part of the
investments  segment,  and a decrease in earnings  from water  services due to a
loss incurred by ISI. Corporate charges and other reflect increased debt service
costs due to the higher  balance of commercial  paper in 1997 and a full quarter
of  distributions  with respect to the  Cumulative  Quarterly  Income  Preferred
Securities  issued in March 1996.  Earnings in 1996 reflect a gain from the sale
of water  assets and a  significant  gain from the sale of a real  estate  joint
venture interest by the real estate part of the investments segment.

Consolidated Financial Comparison of the Quarters Ended March 31, 1997 and 1996.

Operating Revenue and Income.  Electric operations  operating revenue and income
was  down  slightly  compared  to 1996  due to a 2  percent  decrease  in  total
kilowatthour  sales.  The decrease is  attributed to a decline in sales to other
power  suppliers due to the fact that less power was  available for resale.  The
decrease was  partially  offset by an increase in sales to large power  taconite
and paper customers because of more favorable winter weather conditions allowing
higher  production of taconite  pellets compared to 1996 and an increased demand
for paper.

Water  services  operating  revenue  and  income  was 7  percent  higher in 1997
primarily  because of increased  rates approved by the FPSC in September 1996. A
$1.1 million pre-tax gain from the sale of water assets was included in 1996.

Automotive Services.  The addition of eight automobile auction sites during 1996
was the primary factor that contributed to the 52 percent increase in automotive
services  operating revenue and income and the 29 percent increase in the number
of cars sold. The expansion of AFC's dealer financing  business also contributed
to higher operating revenue and income.

Investments operating revenue and income was lower in 1997 because 1996 included
$3.7 million from the sale of Lehigh's joint venture  investment in a resort and
golf course.

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

Operations  expenses were $18.6 million  higher in 1997.  The increase  reflects
$8.7 million of expenses from the eight automobile  auction sites added by ADESA
in 1996.  The  expansion of AFC,  and the 1996  additions of ISI and Palm Coast,
increased operations expense $4.9 million in 1997.

Interest  expense  was  higher  in 1997 due  primarily  to a higher  balance  of
commercial paper used to fund the expansion of automotive services.

Distributions  on redeemable  preferred  securities of subsidiary  are higher in
1997 because the  securities  were  outstanding  for the entire  quarter in 1997
compared to less than one month in 1996.


Business Segment Comparison of the Quarters Ended March 31, 1997 and 1996.

Electric  Operations.  Operating revenue and income from electric operations was
down slightly compared to 1996 due to a 2 percent decrease in total kilowatthour
sales. The decrease is attributed to a decline in sales to other power suppliers
due to the fact that less power was  available  for  resale.  The  decrease  was
partially  offset by an  increase  in sales to large  power  taconite  and paper
customers  because of more favorable winter weather  conditions  allowing higher
production  of taconite  pellets  compared to 1996 and an  increased  demand for
paper.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 32 percent of
electric  operating  revenue in 1997  compared  to 31 percent in 1996.  Electric
sales to paper and other  wood-products  companies  accounted  for 12 percent of
electric  operating revenue in 1997 and 11 percent in 1996. Sales to other power
suppliers accounted for 3 percent of electric operating revenue in 1997 compared
to 5 percent in 1996.

Water Services.  Operating  revenue and income from water services was higher in
1997  primarily  because of  increased  rates  approved  by the FPSC in 1996 for
Florida Water customers.  The increase was offset by less revenue  following the
sale of two water systems by Heater in 1996.  The first quarter of 1996 included
a $1.1 million  pre-tax gain on the sale of one water system in South  Carolina.
ISI,  which was  acquired in April 1996,  increased  revenue by $1.0 million and
operating expenses by $1.6 million in 1997.

Automotive Services.  The addition of eight automobile auction sites during 1996
was the primary factor that  contributed to the 52 percent increase in operating
revenue and income and the 29 percent  increase in the number of cars sold.  The
expansion  of  AFC's  dealer  financing  business  also  contributed  to  higher
operating  revenue and income.  The eight  additional  automobile  auction sites
increased operating expenses by $8.7 million in 1997.

Investments.

   - Securities  Portfolio and Reinsurance.  The Company's securities portfolio
     and  reinsurance  earned an annualized  after tax return of 10.1 percent in
     1997 compared to 9.2 percent in 1996.

   - Real  Estate  Operations.  Revenue  was  down  in  1997  as  a  result  of
     fluctuations  in sales from  quarter to quarter.  Revenue in 1996  included
     $3.7 million from the sale of Lehigh's joint venture investment in a resort
     and golf course.  Also, the April 1996  acquisition of Palm Coast increased
     1997 operating expenses by $1.3 million.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Reference  is made to the  Consolidated  Statement  of Cash  Flows for the three
months ended March 31, 1997 and 1996, for purposes of the following discussion.

Cash Flow Activities. Cash from operating activities was affected by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 4 million  original issue shares of common stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

On May 1, 1997 AFC sold an  additional  $25  million of  receivables  to a third
party  purchaser,  in total  $75  million.  Under  the  terms  of the five  year
agreement,  the purchaser agrees to make reinvestments up to $100 million to the
extent that such reinvestments are supported by eligible  receivables.  Proceeds
from the sale of the receivables were used to repay borrowings from the Company.

Capital  Requirements.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the three months
ended March 31, 1997 totaled  $15.1  million.  These  expenditures  include $7.7
million  for  electric  operations,  $5.7  million for water  services  and $1.7
million for automotive  services.  Internally  generated  funds were the primary
source for funding  electric  and water  operation  expenditures.  ADESA  issued
long-term debt to finance its capital expenditures.

New Accounting  Standard.  In February 1997 the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 128 (SFAS 128),
"Earnings per Share,"  effective for financial  statements  for both interim and
annual  periods  ending  after  December 15, 1997.  Earlier  application  is not
permitted.  SFAS 128  specifies the  computation,  presentation  and  disclosure
requirements  for earnings per share (EPS). The objective of the new standard is
to  simplify  the  computation  of EPS and  make  the  U.S.  standard  for  this
computation  more  compatible with the EPS standards of other countries and with
that of the International  Accounting Standards Committee.  The adoption of SFAS
128 is expected to be immaterial to the Company's results of operations.

Item 5.    Other Information

Reference is made to the Company's 1996 Form 10-K for background  information on
the following updates.  Unless otherwise indicated,  cited references are to the
Company's 1996 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 4. - Table - Contract Status for Minnesota Power Large Power Customers

On May 2, 1997 the MPUC  approved a new Large Power  contract  with Inland Steel
Mining Co.  (Inland).  The  agreement  provides  for  Minnesota  Power to remain
Inland's sole electric supplier through December 31, 2007.


Ref. Page 8. - Fifth Paragraph

On March 14, 1997 the Public Service  Commission of Wisconsin  approved  SWL&P's
request to serve  potential  natural  gas  customers  in the Solon  Springs  and
Bennett,  Wisconsin areas. The project is expected to cost $1.5 million and will
be funded in part through a surcharge to new  customers  in the  expansion  area
over a five-year period.


Ref. Page 14. - Second Paragraph

Since Hernando County has assumed jurisdiction over Florida Water's rates within
the county,  Florida  Water filed a rate  increase in April 1997 as requested by
Hernando County.  Final rates resulting in $8 million in annualized revenues for
water and wastewater services, if approved by Hernando County, would result in a
$124,000 net annual  increase from current  revenue  levels.  By law, the County
must take action by June 1997 on Florida  Water's  request for interim rates.


Ref. Page 15. - Sixth Paragraph

On April 14, 1997 the DOJ,  on behalf of the EPA,  served  Florida  Water with a
complaint in a civil action in the U.S.  District Court for the Middle  District
of Florida  (District  Court).  The suit seeks civil  penalties of not to exceed
$25,000  per day for each  alleged  violation  of  effluent  limitations  in the
National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  permits  occurring  at  the
University Shores and Seaboard wastewater  facilities from February 1992 through
March 1994. Florida Water timely filed with the District Court the answer to the
complaint on May 5, 1997.


Ref. Page 16. - Fourth Paragraph

On March 31, 1997 ADESA  signed a letter  agreement  to  participate  in a joint
venture  to  open  a new  automobile  auction  in  Sacramento,  California.  The
Sacramento  site is on 37 acres with five auction lanes. On March 31, 1997 ADESA
sold  its   Sarasota/Bradenton   auction  facilities  in  Florida  in  favor  of
emphasizing its Jacksonville and South Florida auctions.

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",   "estimates",  "expects",
"intends",   "plans",  "predicts",   "projects",  "will  likely  result",  "will
continue",  or similar  expressions)  are not statements of historical facts and

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:
(i) prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those of
the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the SCPSC and the PSCW,  with respect to
allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal
of assets and  facilities,  operation,  and  construction  of plant  facilities,

events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of such  factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any
such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

Series"),  each of which shall also bear the  descriptive  title "First Mortgage

<PAGE>


of the Original  Indenture.  Securities of the Third Series shall mature on July
31, 2022 and shall be issued as fully registered  Securities in denominations of
One Thousand Dollars and, at the option of the Company, in any integral multiple
or  multiples  thereof  (the  exercise  of such  option to be  evidenced  by the
execution and delivery thereof); they shall bear interest at the rate of 8.137%
per annum,  payable on July 3 1, 1997 for the period from March 31, 1997 to July
31, 1997, and  semi-annually  on January 31 and July 31 of each year  thereafter
until  Maturity;  the principal of,  premium,  if any, and interest on each said
Security  to be  payable  at the  office  or agency of the  Company  in  Apopka,
Florida, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time
of payment is legal tender for public and private debts. Securities of the Third
Series shall be dated as in the Indenture  provided.  Interest on the Securities
of the Third  Series  shall be computed on the actual  number of days elapsed on
the basis of a year  consisting of 360 days. If the Company shall default in the
payment of the  principal  of, or premium or  interest  on, any  Security of the
Third Series,  the Company shall pay to the Holder of such Security such overdue
principal, premium or interest, together with interest on such overdue principal
and (to the extent  permitted by law) on such overdue premium or interest at the
rate  borne by such  Security  immediately  prior to such  default  plus two per
centum (2%) per annum.

         The Regular Record Date referred to in Section 207 of the Indenture for
the payment of the interest on the Securities of the Third Series payable on any
Interest  Payment  Date  shall be the first  Business  Day next  preceding  such
Interest Payment Date.

         The Company  shall be exempt from filing the Cash Flow  Certificate  
provided  in  Section  301(d) of the  Original  Indenture  with  respect  to the
issuance of Securities of the Third Series.

SECTION 2.02. Optional Redemption of Securities of the Third Series.

         (I)  Securities of the Third Series shall be redeemable on any Business
Day,  at the  option  of the  Company,  in whole or in part in  accordance  with
Section 903 of the Original Indenture from time to time, prior to maturity, upon
notice  delivered to each Holder at its last  address  appearing on the Security
Register not less than one Business Day prior to the date fixed for  redemption,
at a Redemption Price ("Third Series General  Redemption Price") (expressed as a
percentage of the principal  amount of the  Securities to be redeemed)  equal to
the  sum of (i)  one  hundred  per  centum  (100%)  plus  (ii) a  "Third  Series
Prepayment  Surcharge" calculated as hereinafter provided, in each case together
with  accrued  interest  to the date  fixed  for  redemption.  For  purposes  of
calculating  the  Third  Series  General  Redemption  Price,  the  Third  Series
Prepayment Surcharge shall be calculated as follows:

               (A) Determine the difference between: (1) eight and 137/1000 per 
               centum (8.137%) minus (2) the Discount Rate, as hereinafter 
               defined, as of the Redemption Date.

               (B) Add one half (1/2) of one per centum (1%) to such difference
               (such that the minimum  result  shall at all times be 1/2 of 1% 
               if the  redemption  occurs prior to July 31,  2000;  thereafter, 
               no amount shall be added in this step (B) provided that, in any 
               event, the minimum result shall be at least zero).

               (C) Divide the result determined in (B) above by 2.

               (D) For each semi-annual period or portion thereof during which 
               the principal amount redeemed was scheduled to have been 
               Outstanding,  multiply the amount described in (C) above by the 
               portion of the principal  amount redeemed that was scheduled to
               have been Outstanding on the last day of such  semi-annual 
               period (such that there is a calculation for each semi-annual

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

               period  during which the  principal amount redeemed was scheduled
               to have been Outstanding).

               (E) Determine the present value of each  semi-annual  calculation
               made under (D) above  based upon the scheduled time that interest
               on the  principal  amount redeemed  would have been  payable and
               the  Discount  Rate as of the  Redemption Date.
               
               (F) Add all of the calculations made under (E) above. The result
               shall be the Third Series Prepayment Surcharge.

         Unless  otherwise  agreed  with  a  majority  of  the  Holders  of  the
Securities of the Third Series to be Outstanding  after a redemption  under this
Section,  the Securities redeemed under this Section may not be used as a credit
for the  redemption  of  Securities  provided for in Section 2.03 of this Second
Supplemental Indenture.

         (II) A notice  containing  the  calculation of the Third Series General
Redemption  Price shall be prepared by the Company and  delivered to the Trustee
and the  Holders of the  Securities  of the Third  Series to be  redeemed on the
Business Day next preceding the Redemption  Date. The  calculation  set forth in
such  notice  shall be final  unless the Holders of the  Securities  so redeemed
notify the  Company and the  Trustee of an error in such calculations within 30
days after notice of such calculation.  If it is determined that the Company has
made an error in such  calculation  and the Company pays the  difference to such
Holders promptly after such determination,  then the Company shall not be deemed
to be in  default  under  the  Indenture  by  reason  of  late  payment  of such
difference.

          (III) As pertains to  Securities  of the Third  Series,  the "Discount
Rate" shall mean an interest rate  determined by adding to the yield on treasury
bonds having  maturities  equal to the weighted  average life to maturity of the
Securities to be redeemed,  determined as necessary by interpolation of treasury
bonds having the next longer and next shorter maturities  ("Treasury Yield"), as
reported on the "MMKS"  Reuters  monitor  screen for the Business Day prior to 
the Redemption Date for such Securities, the following:

               (A) the  estimated  spread  of Farm  Credit  Securities  over the
               Treasury Yield for such day, as reported in a Farm Credit Funding
               Corporation Interest Rate Summary report, and

               (B) the  estimated  dealer  concession,  obtained by a polling of
               Farm Credit Funding  Corporation dealers on the Business Day next
               preceding the Redemption Date, for issuing Farm Credit Securities
               having  a  weighted  average  life  equal to the  number  of days
               between the  Redemption  Date and Maturity for  Securities of the
               Third Series to be redeemed.

       In the event any fact required for such calculation is not available, the
computation  of  Discount  Rate  shall  be made  on the  basis  of a  reasonably
equivalent method of determination.

SECTION 2.03. Sinking Fund for Securities of the Third Series.

      So long as any  Securities  of the Third Series shall remain  Outstanding,

SECTION 3.01. Asset Sale Restrictions for the Third Series.
         
         (A) So long as any  Securities of the Third Series remain  Outstanding,
if the Company  requests the release of Property  Additions  pursuant to Section
1003 or 1004 of the  Original  Indenture  (other  than for  purposes of sales of
property pursuant to or under threat,  reasonably  believed by the Company to be
genuine,  of the  exercise  of a power  of  eminent  domain  or for  tax  exempt

Certificate  filed in connection  with such release shall  identify the Property
Additions that are to be so released.

         (B) So long as any  Securities of the Third Series remain  Outstanding,
if the aggregate  amount of Property  Additions  released upon such basis during
any  calendar  year  shall  exceed  ten per  centum  (10%) of the  amount of Net
Property Additions shown in the most recent Property Additions Certificate filed

Company shall within forty-five days thereafter redeem or have otherwise retired
(other than  pursuant to Section  2.03 of this Second  Supplemental  Indenture),
except to the extent  waived by the Holder,  an  aggregate  principal  amount of
Securities  of such  Series  equal to a pro rata  portion  of the amount of such
excess,  such  pro rata  portion  to be  based  upon  the  ratio of (a) the then
Outstanding aggregate principal amount of Securities of the Third Series, to (b)
the then Outstanding aggregate principal amounts of

                                      -6-

Securities of the Second Series and of the Third Series;  provided however, that
to the extent the Holders of the Securities of the Second Series waive any right
of redemption  under Section  4.01(B) of this Second  Supplemental  Indenture as

         (C) So long as any  Securities of the Third Series remain  Outstanding,
if the aggregate amount of Property  Additions released since March 1, 1993 upon
such  basis  shall  exceed  twenty  five per  centum (25%) of the amount of Net
Property Additions shown in the most recent Property Additions Certificate filed
with the Trustee,  then the Company  shall  promptly  notify the Trustee and, if
there is only one Holder of  Securities  of such Series,  such  Holder;  and the
Company  shall  within  forty-five  days  thereafter  redeem or have  other-wise
retired  (other  than  pursuant  to  Section  2.03 of this  Second  Supplemental
Indenture),  except to the  extent  waived,  an  aggregate  principal  amount of
Securities  of such  Series  equal to a pro rata  portion  of the amount of such
excess,  such  pro rata  portion  to be  based  upon  the  ratio of (a) the then
Outstanding aggregate principal amount of Securities of the Third Series, to (b)
the then  Outstanding  aggregate  principal  amounts of Securities of the Second
Series  and of the Third  Series;  provided,  however,  that to the  extent  the
Holders of the  Securities  of the Second  Series waive any right of  redemption
under  Section  4.01(C) of this  Second  Supplemental  Indenture  as provided in
Section  4.01(D)  hereof,  an additional  principal  amount of Securities of the
Third  Series,  in an amount  equal to the amount  waived by the  Holders of the
Securities of the Second  Series,  shall be redeemed as provided in this Section
3.01(C),  except to the extent  waived by the Holders of the  Securities  of the

Supplemental  Indenture)  retired prior to the respective  Redemption Date. With
respect to the  redemptions  described  in  paragraphs  (B) and (C)  above,  the
Redemption  Price  shall be the Third  Series  General  Redemption  Price,  plus
interest accrued to the Redemption Date. Such redemption shall be prorated among
Holders of  Securities  of the Third  Series  except to the extent  waived;  any
Holder may waive its right to such  redemption by delivering a written waiver to
the Trustee,  in such form as the Trustee shall deem acceptable,  with a copy to
the Company, within ten days after the date of such notice of redemption.

         (E)  Unless  otherwise  agreed  with a majority  of the  Holders of the
Securities of the Third Series to be Outstanding  after a redemption  under this
Section,  the Securities redeemed under this Section may not be used as a credit
for the  redemption  of  Securities  provided for in Section 2.03 of this Second
Supplemental Indenture.

SECTION 3.02. Ownership by Minnesota Power & Light Company.

         So long as any  Securities of the Third Series remain  Outstanding,  if
the  Company's  entire  common  stock  shall  cease  to be  owned,  directly  or
indirectly,  by Minnesota Power & Light Company, then the Company shall promptly
notify  the  Trustee  and,  if there is only one  Holder of  Securities  of such
Series, such Holder; and the Company shall redeem, within ninety days thereafter
and upon at least thirty days' notice, all of the Securities of such Series then
Outstanding at the Third Series General  Redemption  Price,  respectively,  plus

SECTION 3.03. Additional Debt Covenants.

         (A) So  long  as  any  Securities  of the  Third  Series  shall  remain

or before  March 31 of each  calendar  year  after 1996 for the period of twelve
consecutive  calendar  months ending December 31 of the  immediately  preceding

determined in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
existing as of the date of the First  Supplemental  Indenture,  as shown by such
certificate ("Annual Total Debt/Cash Flow Ratio"). If the annual Total Debt/Cash
Flow Ratio  shall  exceed the  maximums  specified  below for the  corresponding
period:

          Twelve Month
          Period Ending                         Maximum Total Debt/
           December 31,                               Cash Flow Ratio
          -------------                               ---------------

          1996 and thereafter                              15:1

then the Company  shall  promptly  notify the Trustee  and, if there is only one
Holder of Securities of such Series,  such Holder; and the Company shall redeem,
within  ninety  days  thereafter  and  upon at least  thirty  days'  notice,  an
aggregate  principal  amount of the  Securities of such Series then  Outstanding
equal to a pro rata portion of the amount  sufficient  to cause the Annual Total
Debt/Cash Flow Ratio to equal the appropriate maximum,  such pro rata portion to
be based upon the ratio of (a) the then Outstanding  aggregate  principal amount
of  Securities  of the  Third  Series  to (b)  the  then  Outstanding  aggregate
principal  amounts  of the  Securities  of the  Second  Series  and of the Third
Series;  provided,  however, that to the extent the Holders of the Securities of
the Second  Series waive any right of redemption  under Section  4.03(A) of this
Second Supplemental Indenture as provided in such Section 4.03(A), an additional
principal  amount of Securities  of the Third Series,  in an amount equal to the

redeemed as provided in this Section 3.03(A), except to the extent waived by the
Holders of the Securities of the Third Series. The Redemption Price shall be the
Third Series General  Redemption  Price, plus interest accrued to the Redemption

Securities then  Outstanding  and (2) the net book value of property,  plant and
equipment,   determined  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted   accounting
principles  existing as of the date of the First Supplemental  Indenture,  which
constitute Property Additions.  If such aggregate principal amount of Securities
then  Outstanding  exceeds  sixty per centum (60%) of the net book value of such
property, plant and equipment then the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee
and, if there is only one Holder of Securities of the Third Series, such Holder;
and the Company shall redeem,  within ninety days  thereafter  and upon at least
thirty days' notice,  a principal  amount of the  Securities of such Series then
Outstanding  equal to a pro rata  portion of the amount  necessary  to cause the
aggregate  principal  amount of Securities  then  Outstanding to equal sixty per
centum (60%) of the net book value of such property,  plant and equipment,  such
pro rata  portion  to be  based  upon  the  ratio  of (a) the  then  Outstanding

4.03(B), an additional principal amount of Securities of the

                                      -8-

Securities of the Second  Series,  shall be redeemed as provided in this Section
3.03(B),  except to the extent  waived by the Holders of the  Securities  of the
Third Series.  The Redemption Price shall be the Third Series General Redemption
Price,  plus interest  accrued to the Redemption Date. The Holders of a majority

deem acceptable,  with a copy to the Company,  within ten days after the date of
such notice of redemption.

         (C) So  long  as  any  Securities  of the  Third  Series  shall  remain

accounting  principles  existing  as of  the  date  of  the  First  Supplemental
Indenture:  If  such  Total  Debt  exceeds  sixty-five  per  centum  (65%)  of
Capitalization, then the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and, if there
is only one Holder of  Securities of such Series,  such Holder;  and the Company
shall  redeem,  within  ninety days  thereafter  and upon at least  thirty days'
notice,  a principal  amount of the  Securities of such Series then  Outstanding
equal to a pro rata portion of the amount necessary to cause Total Debt to equal
not more than  sixty-five  per centum (65%) of  Capitalization,  determined  in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles existing as of the date
of the First Supplemental Indenture,  such pro rata portion to be based upon the
ratio of (a) the then  Outstanding  aggregate  principal amount of Securities of
the Third Series,  to (b) the then Outstanding  aggregate  principal  amounts of
Securities of the Second Series and of the Third Series; provided, however, that
to the extent the Holders of the Securities of the Second Series waive any right
of redemption  under Section  4.03(C) of this Second  Supplemental  Indenture as

of the Third  Series,  in an amount equal to the amount waived by the Holders of
the  Securities  of the Second  Series,  shall be  redeemed  as provided in this
Section 3.03(C), except to the extent waived by the Holders of the Securities of
the  Third  Series.  The  Redemption  Price  shall be the Third  Series  General
Redemption Price, plus interest accrued to the Redemption Date. The Holders of a
majority of the Securities of the Third Series then  Outstanding  may waive such
redemption  by delivering a written  waiver to the Trustee,  in such form as the
Trustee shall deem acceptable, with a copy to the Company, within ten days after
the date of such notice of redemption.

        (D) So  long  as  any  Securities  of  the  Third  Series  shall  remain
Outstanding,  the  Holders of a majority of the  Securities  of such Series then
Outstanding  may,  from time to time but not more than once during any  calendar
year,  upon thirty days notice,  request that the Company file with the Trustee,
as of the end of any calendar month other than December  within sixty days after
the end of such month,  the Cash Flow  Certificate  provided in Section  3.03(A)
hereof and the Accountant's Certificates provided in Section 3.03(B) and 3.03(C)
of this Second  Supplemental  Indenture.  The same redemption  provisions  shall
apply as if such Cash Flow  Certificate and  Accountant's  Certificates had been
delivered  pursuant to such Section  3.03(A),  3.03(B) or 3.03(C) of this Second
Supplemental  Indenture,  using with respect to Section  3.03(A) the maximum for
the period ending on the December 31 next preceding such calendar month.

        (E)  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by a  majority  of  the  Holders  of the
Securities of the Third Series to be Outstanding  after a redemption  under this
Section 3.03, the Securities redeemed under this Section 3.03 may not be used as
a credit for the  redemption of Securities  provided for in Section 2.03 of this
Second Supplemental Indenture.

SECTION 3.04. Restricted Payments.

         So long as any Securities of the Third Series remain  Outstanding,  the
Company  shall not  declare or pay any  Restricted  Payments  unless the Company
files an  Accountant's  Certificate  with the Trustee  and, if there is only one
Holder of Securities of the Third  Series,  sends a copy to such Holder,  within
thirty days prior to such  declaration or payment stating that (A) the amount of
such payment shall not exceed  cumulative  net  additions to or deductions  from
Surplus,  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
existing  as of the  date of this  Second  Supplemental  Indenture,  made  after
December 31, 1992 (excluding any gains on sale of Property  Additions during the
immediately  preceding 12 months in excess of twenty per centum (20%) of the net
additions to Surplus made during such 12 month period);  and (B) that after such
payment  Capital plus Surplus shall equal at least  thirty-five per centum (35%)
of Capitalization,  determined in accordance with generally accepted  accounting
principles existing as of the date of the First Supplemental Indenture.

SECTION 3.05. Redemption Upon Taking of Property by Eminent Domain, etc.

         So long as any Securities of the Third Series shall remain Outstanding,
any Officer's  Certificate provided under Section 1006 of the Original Indenture
shall also state the net book value of the Mortgaged  Property described therein
as taken or sold,  and shall  also  state the net book  value of such  Mortgaged
Property that does not constitute Property Additions.  Notwithstanding  anything
to the contrary contained in Section 1006 of the Original Indenture,  should the
aggregate  net book value of  Mortgaged  Property  taken by the  exercise of the
power of  eminent  domain or sold to an entity  possessing  the power of eminent
domain, or to its designee,  under a threat,  reasonably believed by the Company
to be genuine,  to exercise the same,  be in excess of Fifteen  Million  Dollars
($15,000,000),  the Company shall  redeem,  within ninety days of such taking or
sale and upon at least thirty days' notice, or have otherwise retired, except to
the extent waived,  an aggregate  principal  amount of Securities of such Series
then Outstanding equal to an amount determined pursuant to the next sentence, at
the Redemption  Price of par plus interest  accrued to the Redemption  Date. The
principal  amount of Securities  of the Third Series to be redeemed  pursuant to
this Section 3.05 shall be calculated  by dividing (1) the  aggregate  amount of
Property  Additions  so taken or sold plus the  aggregate  net book value of all
Mortgaged  Property so taken or sold which are not Property Additions by (2) the
amount of Net Property  Additions  shown on the most recent  Property  Additions
Certificate  filed with the Trustee and multiplying  such ratio by the aggregate
principal  amount of  Securities  of such  Series  then  Outstanding;  provided,
however,  that to the extent the Holders of the  Securities of the Second Series
waive any right of  redemption  under  Section 4.05 of this Second  Supplemental
Indenture as provided in such Section 4.05, an  additional  principal  amount of
Securities  of the Third  Series  shall be redeemed as provided in this  Section
3.05 in an amount equal to the amount waived by the Holders of the Securities of
the Second Series,  except to the extent waived by the Holders of the Securities
of the Third  Series.  Such  redemption  shall be  prorated  among  Holders  of
Securities of such Series except to the extent waived;  any Holder may waive its
right to such redemption by delivering a written waiver to the Trustee,  in such
form as the Trustee shall deem  acceptable,  with a copy to the Company,  within
ten days after the date of such  notice of  redemption;  such  waiver  shall not
cause a recalculation of the proration.

SECTION 3.06. Maintenance of Business.

         So long as any  Securities of the Third Series remain  Outstanding,  if
the Company ceases to continue  substantially in the business of providing water
and waste water utility service in the State of Florida,  then the Company shall
promptly  notify the Trustee and, if there is only one Holder of  Securities  of
such Series, such Holder; and the Company shall redeem,  within ninety days and
upon at least  thirty days  notice,  all of the  Securities  of such Series then
Outstanding at the Third Series General  Redemption Price, plus interest accrued
to the  Redemption  Date.  Any Holder may waive its right to such  redemption by
delivering a written waiver

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

to the Trustee,  in such form as the Trustee shall deem acceptable,  with a copy
to the Company, within ten days after the date of such notice of redemption.

SECTION 3.07. Return of Redemption Moneys upon Waiver.

         Upon  receipt of any waiver of  redemption  by any Holder,  the Trustee
shall return to the Company the  redemption  money,  if any, held by the Trustee
for the redemption of such Holder's Securities.

SECTION 3.08. Special Merger Provisions.

         So long as any Securities of the Third Series remain  Outstanding,  the
Company- shall not merge or  consolidate  with another entity unless the Company
shall  have  filed  with the  Trustee,  and,  if there  is only  one  Holder  of
Securities of such Series,  such Holder, an Officer's  Certificate  stating that
(1) the Company or an entity directly or indirectly owned one hundred per centum
(100%) by  Minnesota  Power  &  Light  Company  shall  be the  continuing  and
surviving  corporation and, (2) after such merger or consolidation,  there shall
exist no Event of  Default or event  which,  with the lapse of time or giving of
notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default,  and the Company shall be
able to issue at least One Dollar ($1) of  Securities  under the  provisions  of
Section 401 or 501 of the Indenture, in each case, using a Cash Flow Certificate
stating  an  Annual  Total  Debt/Cash  Flow  Ratio not to  exceed  the  maximums
specified in Section  3.03(A) hereof (using the maximum for the period ending on
the  December  31  next  preceding  such  merger)  rather  than  the  Cash  Flow
Certificate provided in Section 301(d) of the Original Indenture.

SECTION 3.09. Bond Purchase Agreement.

         So long as  CoBank  shall be the sole  owner of all  Securities  of the
Third Series then  Outstanding,  the Company shall redeem,  within ten days, an
aggregate principal amount of Securities of such Series, the redemption of which
is demanded,  in a certificate,  signed by the President,  any Vice President or
any Assistant Vice President of CoBank,  stating that CoBank is entitled to such
redemption under the Bond Purchase Agreement dated March 31, 1997 between CoBank

the  Company  shall file a Property  Additions  Certificate  with the Trustee at
least once during each calendar year.

SECTION 3.11. Amendment to Indenture; Acceleration.

         So long as the  aggregate  principal  amount of Securities of the Third

aggregate   principal  amount  of  the  Securities  of  the  Third  Series  then
Outstanding  is also the Holder of a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of
the  Securities  of the  Second  Series  then  Outstanding,  with the  aggregate

Holder; and the Company shall redeem,  within ninety days thereafter and upon at
least thirty days' notice,  a principal  amount of the Securities of such Series
then  Outstanding  equal to a pro rata portion of the amount  necessary to cause

notice,  a principal  amount of the  Securities of such Series then  Outstanding
equal to a pro rata portion of the amount necessary to cause Total Debt to equal
not more.  than  sixty-five per centum (65%) of  Capitalization,  determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles existing as of the date

the Second Series,  to (b) the then Outstanding  aggregate  principal amounts of
Securities of the Second Series and of the Third Series; provided, however, that
to the extent the Holders of the  Securities of the Third Series waive any right
of redemption  under Section  3.03(C) of this Second  Supplemental  Indenture as

the date of such notice of redemption.

         (D) So  long  as any  Securities  of the  Second  Series  shall  remain
Outstanding,  the  Holders of a majority of the  Securities  of such Series then
Outstanding  may,  from time to time but not more than once during any  calendar
year,  upon thirty days notice,  request that the Company file with the Trustee,

  Original  Indenture  shall  also  state  the net book  value of the  Mortgaged
  Property described therein as taken or sold, and shall also state the net book
  value of such Mortgaged Property that does not constitute  Property Additions.
  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained  in Section  1006 of the
  Original Indenture,  should the aggregate net book value of Mortgaged Property
  taken by the  exercise  of the  power of  eminent  domain or sold to an entity
  possessing the power of eminent  domain,  or to its designee,  under a threat,
  reasonably  believed by the Company to be genuine, to exercise the same, be in

  Securities of the Second  Series to be redeemed  pursuant to this Section 4.05
  shall be calculated by dividing (1) the aggregate amount of Property Additions
  so taken or sold plus the aggregate  net book value of all Mortgaged  Property
  so taken or sold  which are not  Property  Additions  by (2) the amount of Net
  Property  Additions  shown on the most recent Property  Additions  Certificate
  filed with the Trustee and multiplying  such ratio by the aggregate  principal
  amount of Securities of such Series then Outstanding;  provided, however, that
  to the extent the  Holders of the  Securities  of the Third  Series  waive any
  right of redemption under Section 3.05 of this Second  Supplemental  Indenture

  Third Series,  except to the extent waived by the Holders of the Securities of
  the  Second  Series.  Such  redemption  shall be  prorated  among  Holders  of
  Securities  of such Series except to the extent  waived;  any Holder may waive
  its right to such redemption by delivering a written waiver to the Trustee, in
  such form as the Trustee  shall deem  acceptable,  with a copy to the Company,
  within ten days after the date of such notice of redemption; such waiver shall

SECTION 4.11. Amendment to Indenture; Acceleration.

         So long as the aggregate  principal  amount of Securities of the Second
Series then  Outstanding,  combined,  if and only if the Holder of a majority in
aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Securities  of  the  Second  Series  then
Outstanding  is also the Holder of a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of

principal amount of the Securities of the Third Series then Outstanding, exceeds
twenty-five per centum (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of Securities of
all series then Outstanding, the words "twenty-five per centum (25%)" shall be

Series  multiplied  by the  aggregate  principal  amount of such  Securities  so
accelerated,  provided  that the  payment  of such  premium  does not render the
