                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  ALLETE is hereby filing  cautionary  statements
identifying important factors that could cause ALLETE's actual results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE in this  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q, in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"   "projects,"   "will  likely   result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control of ALLETE and may cause  actual
results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements:

     -   war and acts of terrorism;

     -   prevailing  governmental  policies  and regulatory  actions,  including
         those of the United States Congress, state legislatures,  the FERC, the
         MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the PSCW and various county regulators, about
         allowed  rates of  return,  financings,  industry  and rate  structure,
         acquisition  and  disposal  of assets  and  facilities,  operation  and
         construction  of plant  facilities,  recovery  of  purchased  power and
         capital  investments,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail
         competition  (including but not limited to transmission  costs) as well
         as  general  vehicle-related  laws,  including  vehicle  brokerage  and
         auction laws;

     -   unanticipated  impacts  of  restructuring  initiatives  in the electric
         industry;

     -   economic  and  geographic  factors,  including  political  and economic
         risks;

     -   changes  in  and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety laws and
         policies;

     -   weather conditions;

     -   market factors affecting supply and demand for used vehicles;

     -   wholesale power market conditions;

     -   population growth rates and demographic patterns;

     -   the  effects of competition, including the competition  for retail  and
         wholesale  customers, as well as  suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;

     -   pricing and transportation of commodities;

     -   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

     -   unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;

     -   unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

     -   capital market conditions;

     -   competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;

     -   our ability to manage expansion and integrate recent acquisitions; and

     -   the outcome  of legal and administrative  proceedings (whether civil or
         criminal) and settlements that affect the business and profitability of
         ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement
is made,  and ALLETE  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of those  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of those
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim  periods have been
included.  The results of operations  for an interim  period may not give a true
indication of results for the year. The financial  information for prior periods
has been  reclassified to reflect as discontinued  operations our Water Services

NOTE 2.    OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

AFC,  through a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  sells  certain  finance  receivables
through a revolving private  securitization  structure.  On May 31, 2002 AFC and
the subsidiary entered into a revised  securitization  agreement that allows for
the revolving  sale by the  subsidiary to third parties of up to $500 million in
undivided  interests  in eligible  finance  receivables.  The revised  agreement
expires in 2005.  The  securitization  agreement  in place prior to May 31, 2002
limited the sale of undivided interests to $325 million. In accordance with SFAS
140   "Accounting   for  Transfers   and  Servicing  of  Financial   Assets  and
Extinguishments  of Liabilities,"  which became applicable to AFC upon amendment
of  the  securitization   agreement,   AFC,  for  accounting   purposes,   began
consolidating  the subsidiary  used in the  securitization  structure on June 1,
2002.  Previously,  AFC's interest in this  subsidiary was recorded by ALLETE as
residual  interest in other  current  assets ($103 million at December 31, 2001)
net of the subsidiary's  allowance for doubtful accounts.  The residual interest
previously  reflected  in prior  periods  has been  reclassified  by  ALLETE  to
accounts receivable to conform to current year presentations.

AFC managed total  receivables  of $535.2  million at September 30, 2002 ($500.2
million at December 31, 2001);  $200.4 million represent  receivables which were
included  in accounts  receivable  on our  consolidated  balance  sheet  ($233.2
million at December 31, 2001) and $334.8 million  represent  receivables sold in
undivided  interests  through the  securitization  agreement  ($267.0 million at
December 31, 2001) which are off-balance  sheet. AFC's proceeds from the sale of
the  receivables to third parties were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund new loans to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the  subsidiary  must each maintain
certain  financial  covenants such as minimum  tangible net worth to comply with
the terms of the securitization agreement.



NOTE 3.    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We adopted SFAS 142,  "Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets," in January 2002
and,  accordingly,  no longer  amortize  goodwill.  We  completed  the  required
goodwill  impairment  testing  in the first  quarter  of 2002 with no  resulting
impairment.  No event or change has  occurred  that would  indicate the carrying
amount has been impaired since our annual test. SFAS 142 requires  disclosure of
what  reported  net income and earnings per share would have been in all periods
presented, exclusive of amortization expense recognized in those periods related
to goodwill or other intangible  assets that are no longer being amortized.  All
goodwill amortization related to continuing operations.

NOTE 4.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In September 2001 we began a process of systematically evaluating our businesses
to determine the  strategic  value of our assets and explore ways to unlock that
value. As a result, our management and Board of Directors committed to a plan to
sell our  Water  Services  businesses  and our auto  transport  business.  Water
Services includes water and wastewater services operated by several wholly owned
subsidiaries in Florida,  North Carolina and Georgia.  The financial results for
all of these  businesses  have been  accounted for as  discontinued  operations.
Accordingly, we ceased depreciation of assets related to these businesses in the
fourth quarter of 2001. Depreciation expense for the quarter ended September 30,
2001,  was $2.2 million  after-tax  ($6.6 million  after-tax for the nine months
ended  September  30,  2001).  During  the  first  half of 2002  we  exited  our
nonregulated  water  subsidiaries,  our auto  transport  business and our retail
store.

In September  2002 Florida Water entered into an agreement to sell its assets to
FWSA, a governmental  authority that was established by an interlocal  agreement
between  the cities of Gulf  Breeze and  Milton,  Florida.  The total  amount we
expect to receive in the  transaction is $433 million at closing and $74 million
over the next three  years.  The gain on this  transaction  is  estimated  to be
approximately  $100 million after taxes and related costs, and is expected to be
recognized over a four-year period as payments are received.  Aggregate net cash
proceeds to ALLETE are expected to be $260  million for the entire  transaction,
$190 million of which are expected to be received in 2002. Terms of the purchase
agreement call for a closing by December 15, 2002, subject to FWSA being able to
issue bonds for the purchase  price and other  conditions.  Lawsuits  seeking to
halt the sale were  initiated in October 2002 by two civic  associations  and by
four  local  governments  which had hoped to  purchase  Florida  Water's  assets
through a competing  buyer.  Florida  Water  maintains  that these  lawsuits are
without merit and will  vigorously  defend its pending sale to FWSA. The Company
is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits.

We are  using an  investment  banking  firm to  facilitate  the  sale of  Heater
Utilities and Georgia Water Services and discussions with prospective buyers are
in process.  We expect to enter into agreements to sell these businesses in 2002
or 2003.

NOTE 7.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the quarter ended  September 30, 2002 total  comprehensive  income was $32.9
million ($22.2 million for the quarter ended  September 30, 2001).  For the nine
months ended  September 30, 2002 total  comprehensive  income was $110.9 million
($101.4  million  for  the  nine  months  ended   September  30,  2001).   Total
comprehensive  income  includes  net  income,  unrealized  gains  and  losses on
securities  classified  as  available-for-sale,  changes in the fair value of an
interest rate swap and foreign currency translation adjustments.



NOTE 8.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS  143,   "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement   Obligations,"   requires  the
recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in
which it is incurred.  When the  liability is initially  recorded,  the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time,
the  liability  is  accreted to its  present  value and the related  capitalized
charge is depreciated  over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective
for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  Currently,  decommissioning
amounts  collected  in  Minnesota  Power's  rates are  reported  in  accumulated
depreciation,  which upon  adoption  of SFAS 143 by the Company  will  require a
reclassification  to a liability.  We are reviewing what additional  assets,  if
any, may have associated  retirement costs as defined by SFAS 143 and anticipate
no  material  impact  on  the  Company's   financial  position  and  results  of
operations.

On October 25, 2002 the FASB's  Emerging  Issues Task Force rescinded EITF Issue
98-10,  "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities." The ruling takes effect January 1, 2003 for existing  contracts and
immediately for contracts entered into after October 25, 2002. In general,  EITF
98-10 required energy trading  contracts to be  marked-to-market  with resulting
gains and losses recognized in income.  Any gains or losses recognized under the
provisions  of EITF 98-10  through  the end of 2002 will be  reversed  under the
transitional provisions contained in the rescission. The Company was required to
account for the Kendall County tolling agreement under EITF 98-10 which resulted
in the recognition of $4.7 million of mark-to-market  pre-tax income through the
first nine months of 2002 ($0 in 2001). This agreement will be  marked-to-market
through the end of 2002.



NOTE 9.    SQUARE BUTTE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase  agreement with Square Butte that extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in our electric service  territory and enables Minnesota Power to meet
power pool  reserve  requirements.  Square  Butte,  a North  Dakota  cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-MW coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center, North
Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a generating  unit owned by  Minnkota,  a North
Dakota cooperative  corporation whose Class A members are also members of Square
Butte. Minnkota serves as the operator of the Unit and also purchases power from
Square Butte.

Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's  output
under the  Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance
notice  requirement,  Minnkota  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  Minnesota Power
is  obligated  to pay its pro  rata  share  of  Square  Butte's  costs  based on
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to  Unit  output.   Minnesota  Power's  payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service.  At September 30, 2002 Square Butte had total
debt  outstanding of $298.8 million.  Total annual debt service for Square Butte
is expected to be approximately  $36 million in each of the years 2002 and 2003,
and $23 million in each of the years 2004 through 2006. Variable operating costs
include the price of coal purchased from BNI Coal, Ltd., our subsidiary, under a
long-term  contract.  Minnesota Power's payments to Square Butte are approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ALLETE's core operations are focused on two business  segments.  ENERGY SERVICES
includes  electric  and  gas  services,   coal  mining  and  telecommunications.
AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  includes a network  of  wholesale  and total loss  vehicle
auctions,  a finance  company,  a vehicle  remarketing  company,  a company that
provides vehicle inspection services to the automotive industry and its lenders,
and a  company  that  provides  Internet-based  automotive  parts  location  and
insurance claim audit services  nationwide.  INVESTMENTS  AND CORPORATE  CHARGES
includes  our real  estate  operations,  investments  in  emerging  technologies
related to the  electric  utility  industry  and  corporate  charges.  Corporate
charges  represent  general  corporate   expenses,   including   interest,   not
specifically  related to any one business segment.  Also included in Investments
and  Corporate   Charges  is  our  trading   securities   portfolio   which  was
substantially  liquidated  during  the third  quarter of 2002.  The  liquidation
process was  completed in October  2002.  DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS  includes our
Water Services businesses, our auto transport business and our retail store.


CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW

Net income and  earnings  per share for the  quarter  ended  September  30, 2002
increased 19 percent and 17 percent, respectively, from the same period in 2001.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, net income increased 5 percent and
earnings  per share  decreased  3  percent  from the same  period  in 2001.  The
issuance of 6.6 million shares of our common stock in the second quarter of 2001
also impacted earnings per share.  EXIT CHARGES.  Net income for the nine months
ended  September 30, 2002  included $3.9 million of charges  related to our exit
from non-strategic businesses. Excluding these charges, earnings per share would
have been $1.51 for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. GOODWILL. Earnings
for the quarter ended  September  30, 2001  included $2.7 million,  or $0.03 per
share, of goodwill  amortization  expense ($8.3 million, or $0.11 per share, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001). REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION. Earnings for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 included an $11.1 million, or $0.15 per

NET INCOME

The following net income  discussion  summarizes a comparison of the nine months
ended September 30, 2002 to the nine months ended September 30, 2001.

ENERGY  SERVICES'  net income in 2002  decreased  $3.9  million,  or 10 percent,
primarily  due to weak  wholesale  power prices.  Earnings from retail  electric
operations  remained strong as total retail megawatthour sales were up 4 percent
from last year. Net income in 2001 reflected  partial  recovery of 1998 CIP lost
margins.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  reported a $19.6 million,  or 33 percent,  increase in net
income and an 8 percent  increase in EBITDAL over 2001. The continued  growth in
net income was due to  mandated  goodwill  accounting  changes,  lower  interest
expense and improved operating efficiencies. In 2002 the number of vehicles sold
at our wholesale  auction  facilities was similar to last year. Fleet downsizing
by rental car companies  after September 11, 2001 resulted in increased sales of
factory vehicles at our auction  facilities during the fourth quarter of 2001 to
the detriment of 2002.  Vehicle sales in other higher margin  categories  helped
mitigate  the  reduction  in sales of  factory  vehicles.  Aggressive  financing
incentives  offered by vehicle  manufacturers  lowered  the cost of owning a new
vehicle,  which, in turn,  depressed  prices for late-model used vehicles.  This
reduced the number of vehicles  sold at auctions  because car dealers  restocked
their inventories from the increased volume of late-model vehicles traded in for
new vehicles,  and sellers at auction tended to hold their vehicles  rather than
immediately accept the lower prices. As a result,  during the third quarter 2002
conversion  rates (the  percentage of vehicles sold from those that were offered
at auction)  began to drop. The  conversion  rate related to wholesale  vehicles
sold was 60 percent  for 2002 (59 percent for 2001).  Despite  unseasonably  dry
weather  conditions  in 2002 which  usually  means  fewer  total loss  vehicles,
vehicles sold at our total loss vehicle auction facilities were up 27 percent in
2002 reflecting  expansion into new markets,  including  combination  sites with
some of our wholesale auctions. AFC contributed 33 percent of the net income for
Automotive  Services  in 2002 (36  percent  in 2001)  and  reported  a 6 percent
increase in the number of vehicles financed.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES reported $15.5 million less net income in 2002
primarily due to smaller real estate transactions in 2002. In June 2001 our real
estate  operations  reported an $11.1  million  gain on its largest  single sale
ever.  The  liquidation  of our trading  securities  portfolio  during the third
quarter of 2002 also  resulted  in less net  income.  Our  securities  portfolio
earned a negative 1.54 percent after-tax annualized return in 2002 compared to a
positive 4.52 percent in 2001.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS was up $5.7 million  primarily due to the suspension of
depreciation  on our Water  Services  assets.  Net income in 2001  included $6.6
million after-tax of depreciation  expense.  Our Water Services  businesses also
reported a 10 percent increase in water consumption as a result of drier weather
conditions and a 5 percent increase in customers. These increases were partially
offset  by $3.9  million  of exit  charges  associated  with the auto  transport
business and the retail store.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001

ENERGY SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $3.4 million, or 2 percent, in 2002. Revenue from power
marketing  activities  was $11.3 million  higher in 2002 due to the inclusion of
$17.4  million of revenue from merchant  generation  operations  (non-rate  base
generation  sold at market-based  rates pursuant to FERC  authority)  which came
online in 2002.  The  increase  in  revenue  from  power  marketing  activities,
however, was negatively impacted by weak wholesale power prices in 2002. Revenue
from retail electric sales increased $2.1 million in 2002 reflecting a 7 percent
increase in total retail megawatthour sales. Revenue from our telecommunications
business was down $4.4 million in 2002 because  third quarter 2001 included nine
months  of  operations  from  Enventis,  Inc.  which  was  acquired  in July and
accounted for as a pooling of  interests.  Revenue in 2001 included the recovery
of $2.8 million of 1998 CIP lost margins.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in both 2002 and 2001.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both
2002 and 2001.  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 11  percent  of
consolidated operating revenue in 2002 (8 percent in 2001).

OPERATING  EXPENSES were up $4.0 million,  or 3 percent,  in 2002 reflecting the
inclusion  of  merchant  generation  operations  and  the  write  off  of  costs
associated  with a canceled power plant project.  These increases were partially
offset by a $4.0  million  decrease  related to  recoverable  costs  deferred in
conjunction  with  the  fuel  adjustment  clause.  Operating  expenses  for  our
telecommunications  business  were  $4.5  million  lower in 2002  because  third
quarter 2001 included nine months of operations  from  Enventis,  Inc. which was
acquired in July and accounted for as a pooling of interests.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

OPERATING REVENUE was up $4.6 million, or 2 percent, in 2002. At ADESA,  433,000
wholesale  vehicles  were sold in 2002 (429,000 in 2001).  Aggressive  financing
incentives offered by vehicle  manufacturers  continued to negatively impact the
number of vehicles  coming to auction and the average auction prices of vehicles
sold at auction  (see Net  Income-Automotive  Services).  A reduction in factory
vehicles  brought to auction was partially  mitigated by stronger sales in other
vehicle  categories.  At our total loss vehicle  auctions,  41,000 vehicles were
sold in 2002  (34,000 in 2001) an  increase of 20 percent  reflecting  expansion
into  new  markets,  including  combination  sites  with  some of our  wholesale
auctions.

Operating revenue from AFC was higher in 2002 reflecting a 6 percent increase in
vehicles   financed   through  its  loan   production   offices.   AFC  financed
approximately  237,000  vehicles in 2002  (223,000  in 2001) and  managed  total
receivables of $535 million at September 30, 2002 ($497 million at September 30,
2001).

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $3.0 million,  or 2 percent,  in 2002 primarily due
to reduced  interest expense ($3.7 million) as a result of lower interest rates,
the  discontinuance  of  goodwill   amortization  ($3.3  million)  and  improved
operating efficiencies.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
operating  expenses incurred to standardize  operations at all of our total loss
auction facilities and expenditures for information technology initiatives.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

OPERATING  REVENUE  was down $1.1  million,  or 13  percent,  in 2002  primarily
because our trading securities portfolio was substantially liquidated during the
third  quarter.  Revenue  from  our real  estate  operations  was down  slightly
compared to 2001.

OPERATING  EXPENSES  were down $2.9 million,  or 18 percent,  in 2002 because in
2001 additional expenses were incurred for severance packages.

COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001

ENERGY SERVICES

OPERATING  REVENUE was down $6.1  million,  or 1 percent,  in 2002  reflecting a
$20.5 million  decrease in revenue from power marketing  activities due to lower
wholesale  power prices in 2002.  This  decrease was offset by the  inclusion of
$25.4 million of revenue from merchant  generation  operations which came online
in 2002, and $4.8 million for mark-to-market  income related to energy contracts
in 2002 ($0.5 million in 2001). A $15.0 million  decrease in revenue from retail
electric and gas sales was attributed to lower fuel clause recovery due to lower
fuel costs in 2002. Total retail megawatthour sales,  however, were up 4 percent
in 2002 reflecting  increased usage by taconite customers.  In addition,  retail
electric  revenue in 2001 included the recovery of $2.8 million of 1998 CIP lost
margins.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 10 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in both 2002 and 2001.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both
2002 and  2001.  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 7  percent  of
consolidated operating revenue in 2002 and 2001.

OPERATING EXPENSES in 2002 were comparable to 2001.  Purchased power expense was
down $14.2 million in 2002 because  prices paid for  purchased  power were lower
and Company generation was up 5 percent. Purchased gas expense was lower in 2002
because  prices paid in 2001 were at record  highs.  Operating  expenses in 2002
also reflected a $4.0 million decrease related to recoverable  costs deferred in
conjunction  with  the  fuel  adjustment   clause,  the  inclusion  of  merchant
generation operations,  higher expenses for our telecommunications business, and
the write off of costs  associated with a canceled power plant project.  In 2001
the Company had higher plant maintenance  expenses and additional costs incurred
as a result of a severe ice storm.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

OPERATING  REVENUE  was up $17.0  million,  or 3  percent,  in 2002.  At  ADESA,
1,348,000  wholesale vehicles were sold in 2002 (1,353,000 in 2001).  Aggressive
financing  incentives offered by vehicle  manufacturers  continued to negatively
impact the number of vehicles  coming to auction and the average  auction prices
of vehicles sold at auction (see Net Income-Automotive Services). A reduction in
factory vehicles brought to auction was partially mitigated by stronger sales in
other vehicle categories.  At our total loss vehicle auctions,  131,000 vehicles
were  sold in 2002  (103,000  in  2001) an  increase  of 27  percent  reflecting
expansion  into  new  markets,  including  combination  sites  with  some of our
wholesale auctions.

Operating revenue from AFC was higher in 2002 reflecting a 6 percent increase in
vehicles   financed   through  our  loan   production   offices.   AFC  financed
approximately  715,000  vehicles in 2002  (676,000  in 2001) and  managed  total
receivables of $535 million at September 30, 2002 ($497 million at September 30,
2001).

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $16.3 million,  or 3 percent, in 2002 primarily due
to reduced interest expense ($12.9 million) as a result of lower interest rates,
the  discontinuance  of  goodwill   amortization  ($9.9  million)  and  improved
operating efficiencies.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
operating  expenses  incurred to  standardize  operations  at all our total loss
auction facilities and expenditures for information technology initiatives.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

OPERATING REVENUE was down $35.4 million,  or 55 percent,  in 2002 primarily due
to a large real  estate  transaction  recorded  in 2001.  Four large real estate
sales in 2002 contributed $7.4 million to revenue,  while in 2001 six large real
estate sales  contributed  $37.5  million to revenue,  one of which was our real
estate  operations'  largest single  transaction  ever.  Operating  revenue also
reflected less income in 2002 from our trading  securities  portfolio  which was
substantially  liquidated during the third quarter and had  significantly  lower
returns during the year.

OPERATING EXPENSES were down $11.4 million, or 21 percent, in 2002 primarily due
to expenses  associated  with larger real estate  sales in 2001.  Also,  in 2001
additional expenses were incurred for severance packages.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Certain accounting  measurements under applicable  generally accepted accounting
principles involve management's judgment about subjective factors and estimates,
the effects of which are inherently  uncertain.  The following  summarizes those

OUTLOOK

In September  2002 we revised our earnings per share  estimate for 2002 to be in
the range of $1.80 to $1.90  including  the  goodwill  accounting  change.  This
estimate  excluded $0.05 per share of charges  related to the exit from the auto
transport  business and the retail store,  and any potential gain  recognized on
the sale of our Water Services businesses. Our recent adjustment in our earnings
guidance reflected the liquidation of the trading securities  portfolio and year
to date weaker  performance  within our Energy Services segment due to continued
lower-than-expected wholesale power prices.

During the first few weeks of the fourth quarter,  we experienced a notable drop
in the conversion  rates at our wholesale  vehicle auctions which we believe was
primarily influenced by vehicle manufacturers  extending  zero-percent financing
into the 2003 model year.  Aggressive  financing  incentives lowered the cost of
owning a new vehicle,  which,  in turn,  depressed  prices for  late-model  used
vehicles.  This  reduced  the number of vehicles  sold at  auctions  because car
dealers  restocked  their  inventories  from the increased  volume of late-model
vehicles traded in for new vehicles, and sellers at auction tended to hold their
vehicles rather than immediately  accept the lower prices. We expect the sellers
of used vehicles to ultimately  begin  selling  again,  but timing is uncertain.
Based on current  market  conditions  we believe  Automotive  Services  will not
achieve our stated  earnings  growth goal of 30 percent this year. We now expect
ALLETE's  earnings  per share to be at the low end of the range with  respect to
our estimate for 2002.

The cash generated from the liquidation of our trading  securities  portfolio as
well as from  our  continuing  operations  and the  expected  sale of our  Water
Services' assets will be used to reduce debt and fund strategic initiatives. Our
balance   sheet  remains   strong.   We  continue  to  focus  on  our  two  core
competencies-Energy  Services  and  Automotive  Services.  We  believe  both are
positioned well to produce earnings growth as their individual markets improve.

ENERGY SERVICES.  Earnings from our core retail electric business remain strong.
Our generation costs, including our merchant generation,  are competitive in the
regions we serve.  We are well positioned to recognize  increased  benefits from
wholesale electric sales as market conditions improve.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES. The performance of our Automotive Services business for the
nine  months  ended  September  30, 2002 has  demonstrated  our ability to drive
efficiencies  at our  auctions  acquired  since  January  2000  and to  generate
profits. We expect to continue EBITDAL and revenue improvement, and double digit
earnings growth for 2003. We have not seen factory vehicle volume at our vehicle
auctions  return to normal  levels as we  anticipated.  This,  combined with the
impact of aggressive  financing  incentives  discussed above, has resulted in an
unexpected  recent drop in conversion rates making it likely we will not achieve
our stated  earnings  growth  goal of 30 percent  this  year.  AFC's  receivable
portfolio  continues to maintain its strong credit quality and  contribution  to
net income.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES. We anticipate net income from Investments and
Corporate  Charges  to  decline in 2002 due to the  liquidation  of our  trading
securities portfolio and, as expected, a lower contribution from our real estate
operations.  Our revised  earnings  estimate for 2002 reflects a $0.10 per share
income  reduction  due to  minimal  contribution  from  our  trading  securities
portfolio. We liquidated our trading securities portfolio to reduce our exposure
to increased volatility in the securities market.  Proceeds from the liquidation
have been used to reduce debt.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS.  In September  2002  Florida  Water agreed to sell its
assets to FWSA, a governmental  authority that was  established by an interlocal
agreement  between  the cities of Gulf  Breeze and  Milton,  Florida.  The total
amount we expect to receive in the  transaction  is $433  million at closing and
$74 million over the next three years. The gain on this transaction is estimated
to be approximately  $100 million after taxes and related costs, and is expected
to be recognized over a four-year period as payments are received. Aggregate net
cash  proceeds are expected to be $260  million for the entire  transaction,  of
which $190  million are  expected to be received in 2002.  Terms of the purchase
agreement call for a closing by December 15, 2002, subject to FWSA being able to
issue bonds for the purchase  price and other  conditions.  Lawsuits  seeking to
halt the sale were  initiated in October 2002 by two civic  associations  and by
four  local  governments  which had hoped to  purchase  Florida  Water's  assets
through a competing  buyer.  Florida  Water  maintains  that these  lawsuits are
without merit and will  vigorously  defend its pending sale to FWSA. The Company
is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits.

We are  using an  investment  banking  firm to  facilitate  the  sale of  Heater
Utilities and Georgia Water Services and discussions with prospective buyers are
in process.  We expect to enter into agreements to sell these businesses in 2002
or 2003.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES

During  the first  nine  months of 2002  cash  flow  from  operating  activities
reflected  strong  operating  results  and  continued  focus on working  capital
management.  Cash flow from  operating  activities was higher in 2002 due to the
liquidation of the trading securities portfolio and the timing of the collection
of certain finance  receivables  outstanding at December 31, 2001. Also, in 2001
additional trading securities were purchased with a portion of the proceeds from
a common stock issuance. Cash flow from operations was also affected by a number
of factors representative of normal operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of  commercial  paper.  During the third quarter of 2002 we
substantially  liquidated  our trading  securities  portfolio.  The  liquidation
process was  completed in October  2002.  Proceeds  have been used to reduce our
debt.  Approximately  4.8 million  original issue shares of our common stock are
available for issuance  through  Invest  Direct,  our direct stock  purchase and
dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided.  However, ADESA has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for dealers to purchase  vehicles at
auctions in exchange for a security  interest in each vehicle.  The financing is
provided  through  the  earlier  of the date the dealer  sells the  vehicle or a
general  borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC has  arrangements  to use proceeds
from the sale of  commercial  paper  issued  by  ALLETE  to meet its  short-term
working capital requirements.

AFC,  through a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  sells  certain  finance  receivables
through a revolving private  securitization  structure.  On May 31, 2002 AFC and
the subsidiary entered into a revised  securitization  agreement that allows for
the revolving  sale by the  subsidiary to third parties of up to $500 million in
undivided  interests  in eligible  finance  receivables.  The revised  agreement
expires in 2005.  The  securitization  agreement  in place prior to May 31, 2002
limited the sale of undivided interests to $325 million. In accordance with SFAS
140   "Accounting   for  Transfers   and  Servicing  of  Financial   Assets  and
Extinguishments  of Liabilities,"  which became applicable to AFC upon amendment
of  the  securitization   agreement,   AFC,  for  accounting   purposes,   began
consolidating  the subsidiary  used in the  securitization  structure on June 1,
2002.  Previously,  AFC's interest in this  subsidiary was recorded by ALLETE as
residual  interest in other current assets ($103.0 million at December 31, 2001)
net of the subsidiary's  allowance for doubtful accounts.  The residual interest
previously  reflected  in prior  periods  has been  reclassified  by  ALLETE  to
accounts receivable to conform to current year presentations.

AFC managed total  receivables  of $535.2  million at September 30, 2002 ($500.2
million at December 31, 2001);  $200.4 million represent  receivables which were
included  in accounts  receivable  on our  consolidated  balance  sheet  ($233.2
million at December 31, 2001) and $334.8 million  represent  receivables sold in
undivided  interests  through the  securitization  agreement  ($267.0 million at
December 31, 2001) which are off-balance  sheet. AFC's proceeds from the sale of
the  receivables to third parties were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund new loans to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the  subsidiary  must each maintain
certain  financial  covenants such as minimum  tangible net worth to comply with
the terms of the securitization agreement.

We provide up to $50 million in credit support to facilitate the power marketing
activities of Split Rock Energy, and had $31.9 million in outstanding support at
September 30, 2002 ($36.0 million at December 31, 2001).

SECURITIES.  In March 2001  ALLETE,  ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE  Capital III,
jointly filed a  registration  statement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement,  which has been declared
effective by the SEC, relates to the possible issuance of an aggregate amount of
$500 million of securities which may include ALLETE common stock, first mortgage
bonds and other debt  securities,  and ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE Capital III
preferred  trust  securities,   of  which  approximately  $387  million  remains
available to be issued.  ALLETE also previously filed a registration  statement,
which has been declared  effective by the SEC, relating to the possible issuance
of $25 million of first  mortgage bonds and other debt  securities.  We may sell
all or a portion of the remaining  registered  securities if warranted by market
conditions  and our  capital  requirements.  Any  offer  and  sale of the  above
mentioned  securities  will be made only by means of a  prospectus  meeting  the
requirements  of the  Securities  Act of 1933  and  the  rules  and  regulations
thereunder.

INVESTMENTS.  As  investments  in emerging  technology  companies  are sold,  we
recognize a gain or loss. Our direct  investment in the companies that have gone
public, which we account for as available-for-sale  securities, had a cost basis
of  approximately  $10 million at September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001.  The
aggregate  market value of our  investment  in these  companies at September 30,
2002 was $4 million ($17 million at December 31,  2001).  We believe the decline
in market value that has occurred  since second  quarter 2002 is  temporary.  We
have the ability and intent to hold these investments until the market recovers.
These investments provide us with access to developing technologies before their
commercial  debut,  as well  as  potential  financial  returns.  We  view  these
investments as a source of capital for redeployment in existing businesses.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

As  a  result  of  new  construction  and  expansions  at  Automotive  Services,
consolidated  capital expenditures for 2002 are now expected to be $235 million.
Consolidated  capital  expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2002
totaled $138.4 million ($108.4 million in 2001).  Expenditures for 2002 included
$63.6  million for Energy  Services and $39.6 million for  Automotive  Services.
Expenditures  for 2002 also  included  $35.2  million  related  to  discontinued
operations  ($31.3 million to maintain our Water Services  businesses while they
are in the process of being sold;  $3.9  million to buy  previously  leased auto
transportation  trucks).  Internally  generated funds were the primary source of
funding for these expenditures.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS  143,   "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement   Obligations,"   requires  the
recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in
which it is incurred.  When the  liability is initially  recorded,  the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time,
the  liability  is  accreted to its  present  value and the related  capitalized
charge is depreciated  over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective
for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  Currently,  decommissioning
amounts  collected  in  Minnesota  Power's  rates are  reported  in  accumulated
depreciation,  which upon  adoption  of SFAS 143 by the Company  will  require a
reclassification  to a liability.  We are reviewing what additional  assets,  if
any, may have associated  retirement costs as defined by SFAS 143 and anticipate
no  material  impact  on  the  Company's   financial  position  and  results  of
operations.

On October 25, 2002 the FASB's  Emerging  Issues Task Force rescinded EITF Issue
98-10,  "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities." The ruling takes effect January 1, 2003 for existing  contracts and
immediately for contracts entered into after October 25, 2002. In general,  EITF
98-10 required energy trading  contracts to be  marked-to-market  with resulting
gains and losses recognized in income.  Any gains or losses recognized under the
provisions  of EITF 98-10  through  the end of 2002 will be  reversed  under the
transitional provisions contained in the rescission. The Company was required to
account for the Kendall County tolling agreement under EITF 98-10 which resulted
in the recognition of $4.7 million of mark-to-market  pre-tax income through the
first nine months of 2002 ($0 in 2001). This agreement will be  marked-to-market
through the end of 2002.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

During  the  third  quarter  of 2002 we  substantially  liquidated  our  trading
securities  portfolio.  The  liquidation  process was completed in October 2002.
Proceeds   have  been  used  to  reduce  our  debt.   At   September   30,  2002
available-for-sale  securities  consisted of the common stock of publicly traded
companies and a grantor trust established to fund certain employee benefits.

Our trading securities  portfolio had a fair value of $43.5 million at September
30,  2002  ($155.6  million  at  December  31,  2001).  Our   available-for-sale
securities  portfolio  had a fair value of $15.5  million at September  30, 2002
($26.5 million at December 31, 2001).


FOREIGN CURRENCY

Our foreign currency  exposure is limited to the conversion of operating results
of our  Canadian  subsidiaries  and,  therefore,  we have not  entered  into any
foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge the  conversion of our Canadian  operating
results into United States dollars.

POWER MARKETING

Minnesota Power purchases power for retail sales in our retail service territory
and sells excess  generation in the wholesale  market.  At the end of the second
quarter of 2002 we had 500 MW of merchant  generation  (non-rate base generation
sold at market-based rates pursuant to FERC authority) available for sale to the
wholesale  market.  Our  merchant  generation  includes 225 MW from our Taconite
Harbor Energy Center in northern Minnesota that was acquired in October 2001. It
also includes 275 MW of generation  secured through a 15-year tolling agreement,
which commenced in May 2002, with NRG Energy at the Kendall County facility near
Chicago,  Illinois. Under the Kendall County tolling agreement, the Company pays
a fixed capacity charge for the right,  but not the  obligation,  to utilize one
275 MW generating  unit. We are  responsible  for arranging the natural gas fuel
supply and are entitled to the electricity produced. Our strategy is to sell the
majority  of  merchant   generation  through  long-term   contracts  of  various
durations.  The  balance  will be sold in the spot  market,  through  short-term
agreements.  The  services  of Split Rock  Energy may be  utilized  to broker or
market merchant generation. We currently have two long-term forward capacity and
energy  contracts  related  to  generation  secured  by the NRG  Energy  tolling
agreement.  Each is for 50 MW,  with one  having a 10-year  term and the other a
15-year term.

The services of Split Rock Energy are used to fulfill purchase  requirements for
retail  load and to market  excess  generation.  We own 50 percent of Split Rock
Energy which was formed in 2000 with Great River Energy to provide us with least
cost supply,  maximize the value of our generation assets and maximize marketing
revenue within  prescribed  limits.  Split Rock Energy operates in the wholesale
energy markets, and engages in marketing activities by entering into forward and
option  contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity.  These contracts are
primarily  short-term in nature with maturities of less than one year.  Although
Split Rock Energy generally attempts to balance its purchase and sale positions,
commodity  price risk  sometimes  exists or is  created.  This risk is  actively
managed through a risk management program that includes policies, procedures and
limits established by the Split Rock Energy Board of Governors.

Revenue for the nine months ended  September  30, 2002 included $4.8 million for
mark-to-market  income  attributable to the power marketing  activities of Split
Rock Energy and our merchant  generation  operations  ($0.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2001). Included in the $4.8 million of mark-to-market
income in 2002 is $5.6 million of mark-to-market income for future fixed margins
associated with the Kendall County contracts.

On October 25, 2002 the FASB's  Emerging  Issues Task Force rescinded EITF Issue
98-10,  "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities." The ruling takes effect January 1, 2003 for existing  contracts and
immediately for contracts entered into after October 25, 2002. In general,  EITF
98-10 required energy trading  contracts to be  marked-to-market  with resulting
gains and losses recognized in income.  Any gains or losses recognized under the
provisions  of EITF 98-10  through  the end of 2002 will be  reversed  under the
transitional provisions contained in the rescission. The Company was required to
account for the Kendall County tolling agreement under EITF 98-10 which resulted
in the recognition of $4.7 million of mark-to-market  pre-tax income through the
first nine months of 2002 ($0 in 2001). This agreement will be  marked-to-market
through the end of 2002.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain a system of controls and procedures  designed to provide  reasonable
assurance  as  to  the  reliability  of  the  financial   statements  and  other
disclosures  included  in  this  report,  as well as to  safeguard  assets  from
unauthorized  use or disposition.  We evaluated the  effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure  controls and procedures  under the  supervision
and with the participation of management,  including our chief executive officer
and chief  financial  officer,  within 90 days prior to the filing  date of this
report.  Based  upon that  evaluation,  our chief  executive  officer  and chief
financial  officer  concluded  that our  disclosure  controls and procedures are
effective  in  timely  alerting  them to  material  information  required  to be
included in our periodic SEC filings.  No  significant  changes were made to our
internal  controls  or other  factors  that  could  significantly  affect  these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

In  September  2002  Florida  Water  agreed  to  sell  its  assets  to  FWSA,  a
governmental  authority that was established by an interlocal  agreement between
the cities of Gulf Breeze and  Milton,  Florida.  The total  amount we expect to
receive in the  transaction  is $433 million at closing and $74 million over the
next three years.  The gain on this transaction is estimated to be approximately
$100 million  after taxes and related  costs,  and is expected to be  recognized
over a four-year  period as payments are received.  Lawsuits seeking to halt the
sale were initiated in October 2002 by two civic  associations and by four local
governments  which  had  hoped to  purchase  Florida  Water's  assets  through a
competing  buyer.  Florida Water maintains that these lawsuits are without merit
and will  vigorously  defend its pending sale to FWSA.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of these lawsuits.

In October 2002 Eveleth Mines LLC announced  that only 30 percent of the plant's
capacity  for  taconite  production  is on order for 2003 making  financing  for
working capital  uncertain and plant closure a possibility.  For the nine months
ended September 30, 2002,  Eveleth Mines represented  approximately 1 percent of
ALLETE's consolidated operating revenue.

In  October  2002 U.S.  Steel  Corp.  announced  the sale of 80  percent  of its
taconite  production  facility in Mt.  Iron,  Minnesota  to an entity  formed by
Apollo  Management,  LP, a venture  capital firm in New York.  We  anticipate no
effect on current taconite production estimates or Minnesota Power's large power
contract with the facility.

In August 2002 Rapids Power LLC announced  that it had canceled  plans to pursue
construction of a state-of-the-art 225 megawatt combined-heat-and-power facility
in Grand  Rapids,  Minnesota,  because its cost is presently too high to support
marketable  electricity and lower mill steam costs. The announcement  followed a
decision  last spring by Rapids  Power to delay  seeking a  Certificate  of Need
permit,  which  would have led to further  study of the  project's  feasibility.
Rapids Power was a partnership between Rainy River Energy Corporation,  a wholly
owned  subsidiary  of the  Company,  and  Blandin  Paper  Co., a  subsidiary  of
UPM-Kymmene Corporation.

In May 2001 SWL&P  received  notice  from the  Wisconsin  Department  of Natural
Resources  (WDNR)  that the City of  Superior  had found soil  contamination  on
property adjoining a former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) site owned and operated
by SWL&P's  predecessors  from 1889 to 1904. The WDNR requested an environmental
investigation  be  initiated.  The WDNR also issued  SWL&P a  Responsible  Party
letter in February 2002 to initiate tracking of the project in the WDNR database
so that progress can be monitored.  The environmental  investigation is underway
and the Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter at this time.
