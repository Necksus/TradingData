                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",
"expects",  "intends",  "plans",  "predicts",  "projects", "will likely result",
"will continue",  or similar expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and  may  be  forward-looking.  Forward-looking  statements  involve  estimates,
assumptions,  and uncertainties and are qualified in their entirety by reference
to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult
to predict, contain uncertainties, are beyond the control of the Company and may
cause   actual   results  to  differ   materially   from  those   contained   in
forward-looking statements:
          -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including
             those of the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC and the PSCW,  with
             respect to allowed  rates of return,  industry and rate  structure,
             acquisition  and disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation and
             construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and
             other capital investments, and present or prospective wholesale and
             retail  competition  (including but not limited to retail  wheeling
             and transmission costs);
          -  economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
             risks;  
          -  changes in and compliance  with  environmental  and safety laws and
             policies; 
          -  weather conditions; 
          -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;   
          -  competition  for  retail  and  wholesale customers;   
          -  Year  2000  issues;  
          -  pricing  and   transportation  of commodities; 
          -  market demand,  including structural market changes;
          -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation; 
          -  changes in project costs;  
          -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital 
             expenditures;  
          -  capital market conditions; 
          -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and 
          -  legal and administrative proceedings (whether  civil or  criminal)
             and  settlements that influence the business and profitability of 
             the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Florida First  District Court
of Appeals (Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform
rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With  "uniform  rates," all
customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and  wastewater
services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
ordered  Florida Water to issue  refunds to those  customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge to  customers  who paid
less under uniform rates. Florida Water appealed, and the Court of Appeals ruled
in June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without balancing surcharges.
In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC issued an order on January
26, 1998 that would not require  Florida  Water to refund  about $12.5  million,
which included interest, to customers who paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 26, 1998 order,  the FPSC  required  Florida Water to refund
$2.5 million,  the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service area from
January  1996 through June 1997 under  uniform  rates which  exceeded the amount
these customers would have paid under a modified stand-alone rate structure.  No
balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund because Spring
Hill customers continued to pay uniform rates after other customers began paying
modified stand-alone rates effective January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's interim
rate order in Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case.  The FPSC did not include  Spring
Hill in this interim rate order because Hernando County had assumed jurisdiction
over Spring Hill's rates.  In June 1997 Florida Water reached an agreement  with
Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to stand-alone  rates for Spring Hill
customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 26, 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund  because the
FPSC had no authority to order uniform rates.  The Company has appealed the $2.5
million refund order.  Initial briefs were filed by all parties on May 22, 1998.
Upon  issuance of the June 10, 1998 opinion of the Court of Appeals with respect
to  Florida  Water's  1995 Rate Case  (see  next  paragraph)  in which the court
reversed  its  previous  ruling  that the FPSC was  without  authority  to order
uniform rates,  other customer  groups  supporting the FPSC's January 1998 order
filed a motion  with the Court of  Appeals  seeking  dismissal  of the appeal by
customer groups seeking refunds.  Customers  seeking refunds have filed a motion
requesting  authority to amend their  briefs.  No provision  for refund has been
recorded.  The Company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals
process.

FLORIDA WATER 1995 RATE CASE.  Florida  Water  requested an $18.1  million rate
increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers of Florida  Water
regulated by the FPSC. In October 1996 the FPSC issued its final order approving
an $11.1 million annual increase.  In November 1996 Florida Water filed with the
Court of Appeals an appeal of the FPSC's final order seeking  judicial review of
issues relating to the amount of investment in utility facilities recoverable in
rates from current customers. Other parties to the rate case also filed appeals.
In  the  course  of  the  appeals  process,  on  its  own  initiative  the  FPSC
reconsidered an issue in its initial decision and, in June 1997, allowed Florida
Water to resume collecting  approximately $1 million, on an annual basis, in new
customer connection fees. On June 10, 1998 the Court of Appeals ruled in Florida
Water's favor on all material  issues appealed by Florida Water and remanded the
matter back to the FPSC for action  consistent with the Court's order. The Court
of Appeals also  overturned its decision in Florida Water's 1991 Rate Case which
had required a "functional relationship" between service areas as a precondition
to  implementation  of uniform rates.  Parties  opposed to the Court of Appeals'
reversal  of its  previous  decision  regarding  uniform  rates  have  requested
rehearing.  The  Company  is unable to  predict  the  timing or outcome of these
proceedings.

HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY RATES.   In  July  1997  Florida  Water  filed  with  the
Hillsborough County Utilities Department a request for an annual interim revenue
increase of $0.8 million and a final  increase of $0.9  million.  Interim  rates
became  effective in August 1997.  Hearings have concluded.  A final decision is
anticipated  in the third quarter of 1998.  The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of this case.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS CONTINUED

NORTH  CAROLINA  UTILITIES  COMMISSION.  In September 1997 Heater filed with the
NCUC for an annual rate increase of $1.1 million for its water and wastewater 
customers. On May 13, 1998 the NCUC  issued an order  authorizing  a rate 
increase of $0.3 million.  The test year was  adjusted for  post-test  year 
customer  growth and consumption  which  substantially decreased the annual rate
increase  required. Heater does not plan to appeal this order.



NOTE 3.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the quarter ended June 30, 1998 total comprehensive income was $21.1 million
($21.3  million for the quarter ended June 30,  1997).  For the six months ended
June 30, 1998 total  comprehensive  income was $39.2 million  ($35.4 million for
the six months ended June 30, 1997). The difference between total  comprehensive
income and net income was unrealized  gains and losses on securities  classified
as available-for-sale, and cumulative foreign translation adjustments.

NOTE 5.    ACQUISITIONS

ADESA acquired the assets of Greater  Lansing Auto Auction in Lansing,  Michigan
and I-55 Auto Auction in St Louis,  Missouri on April 30, 1998,  and  Ark-La-Tex
Auto Auction in  Shreveport,  Louisiana on May 27, 1998 for a combined  purchase
price of $23.8 million.  The acquisitions  were accounted for using the purchase
method and resulted in goodwill of $16.3 million which will be amortized  over a
40 year period. Financial results for these three auctions have been included in
the Company's  consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
Pro forma financial  results have not been presented due to  immateriality.  The
Company used internally  generated funds and issued  commercial paper to acquire
these assets. ADESA now owns and operates 28 vehicle auction facilities.

NOTE 6.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company has had a power  purchase  agreement  with Square  Butte since 1977.
Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation,  owns a 455 MW coal-fired
generating  unit (Unit) near  Center,  North  Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a
generating unit owned by Minnkota Power Cooperative,  Inc.  (Minnkota),  a North
Dakota cooperative  corporation whose Class A members are also members of Square
Butte.  Minnkota  serves as operator of the Unit and also  purchases  power from
Square Butte.

In May 1998 the  Company  and Square  Butte  entered  into a new power  purchase
agreement (1998 Agreement),  replacing the 1977 agreement.  The Company extended
by 20 years,  through  January 1, 2027,  its access to Square  Butte's  low-cost
electricity  and  eliminated its  unconditional  obligation to pay all of Square
Butte's  costs if not paid by Square  Butte  when due.  The 1998  Agreement  was
reached in conjunction  with  termination of Square Butte's  previous  leveraged
lease financing arrangement and refinancing of associated debt.

Similar  to  the  1977   agreement,   the  Company  is  initially   entitled  to
approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under the 1998  Agreement.  After
2005 and upon compliance with a two-year  advance notice  requirement,  Minnkota
has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a
minimum of 50 percent.

Under the 1998 Agreement,  the Company is obligated to pay its pro rata share of
Square Butte's costs based upon Unit output  entitlement.  The Company's payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or purchased,  for a period of one year. The Company's obligation under
the 1977 agreement was absolute and  unconditional  whether or not any power was
delivered. Square Butte's fixed costs consist primarily of debt service. At June
30, 1998 Square Butte had total debt outstanding of $343.4 million. Total annual
debt  service for Square  Butte is expected to be  approximately  $36 million in
1999 through 2002 and $23 million in 2003.  Variable operating costs include the
price of coal purchased from BNI Coal, a subsidiary of Minnesota Power,  under a
long-term  contract.  The  Company's  payments to Square  Butte are  approved as
purchased power expenses for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

The following  summarizes  significant  events that led to the 22 percent and 19
percent  increase in net income for the  quarter  and six months  ended June 30,
1998, respectively.

   - ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  Net income from Electric Operations reflected strong
     sales to other power suppliers during the quarter and six months ended June
     30, 1998; however,  additional  operating and purchased power expenses were
     incurred  because of  scheduled  maintenance  outages  at major  generating
     facilities and higher priced purchased power. The scheduled maintenance has
     positioned the Company to meet  anticipated  strong  electric demand during
     the rest of 1998. Higher priced purchased power was attributed to increased
     demand in the Midwest as a result of storms and hot weather.  Net income in
     1998 also reflected  fewer sales to residential  electric and gas customers
     due to the  unusually  mild  winter and warm  spring.  In 1997 the  Company
     recorded gains from the sale of certain land and other property.

   - WATER  SERVICES. Net  income from  Water Services was higher in  1998 due
     primarily  to customer growth, increased  consumption and  operating 
     efficiencies. Increased sales of water resulting from drought conditions in
     Florida  during the second  quarter of 1998 helped to offset lower sales in
     the first quarter of 1998 because of record rainfall.

   - AUTOMOTIVE   SERVICES.   The  significant  increase  in  net  income  from
     Automotive Services was driven by more vehicle sales, and the expansion and
     maturing  of  recently  opened  loan  production  offices in the  floorplan
     financing business.  The Company has added three new auction facilities and
     nine loan production offices in 1998.

   - INVESTMENTS.  The increase in net income from  Investments was attributable
     to four large sales at Palm Coast and the sale of a partnership interest in
     a development at Lehigh.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998 AND 1997.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  Operating revenue and income from Electric Operations were
$11.0 million higher in 1998, even though kilowatthour sales remained at similar
levels.  This  increase was  primarily  attributable  to higher sales prices for
power sold to other power suppliers. Average wholesale prices from Company sales
were up approximately 60 percent from 1997 as a result of a supply shortage from
storms and hot weather in the  Midwest.  In  addition,  revenue  from retail and
wholesale  customers  was higher in 1998 due to an  increase  in the fuel clause
component. The fuel clause component was higher to allow recovery of the cost of
replacement  power needed during scheduled  outages at Square Butte and Boswell.
Demand  revenue  from  large  power  customers  was lower in 1998 as a result of
successful  renegotiation  of contracts  which  extended  the term,  but in turn
reduced  the  demand  charge  component.  Operating  revenue  and income in 1997
included  $2.8  million  in pre-tax  gains from the sale of rights to  microwave
frequencies in accordance  with a federal mandate and the sale of property along
the St.  Louis  River to ensure the  preservation  of  wilderness  lands.  Total
operating  expenses  were  $11.4  million  higher in 1998 due to a $7.7  million
increase  in fuel and  purchased  power  expense.  Fuel  expense  was about $1.7
million  higher  because  of more  steam  generation.  Purchased  power  expense
increased  $6.0  million  because  of higher  prices in the  market.  Operations
expenses  were  $3.5  million  higher  due  to  scheduled  outages  at  Boswell,
consulting  services  and  amortization  of deferred Conservation  Improvement 
Programs costs. Property taxes were $0.7 million lower in 1998 due to the reform
of the  Minnesota  property  tax  system.  Income tax expense was $0.2 million
lower in 1998 because of lower operating income.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 30 percent of
electric  operating  revenue and income in 1998 (31  percent in 1997).  Electric
sales to paper and pulp mills  accounted  for 11 percent of  electric  operating
revenue and income in 1998 (12 percent in 1997).  Sales to other power suppliers
accounted  for 16 percent of electric  operating  revenue and income in 1998 (12
percent in 1997).

WATER  SERVICES.  Operating  revenue  and income from Water  Services  were $2.6
million  higher in 1998 due  primarily to increased  revenue from  non-regulated
water subsidiaries.  Consumption,  which was up 19 percent in 1998,  reflected a
September  1997  acquisition  of a water  utility in North  Carolina and drought
conditions in Florida. Total operating expenses were $1.6 million higher in 1998
due to marginal  costs  related to increased  revenue from  non-regulated  water
subsidiaries.  Income tax expense  was $0.5  million  higher in 1998  because of
increased operating income.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  Operating revenue and income from Automotive Services were
$20.4 million higher in 1998 due to a 16 percent  increase in vehicle sales, and
the  expansion  and maturing of AFC's  floorplan  financing  business.  At ADESA
auction  facilities  236,000 vehicles were sold in 1998 (204,000 in 1997). ADESA
added three new auction  facilities in 1998. AFC opened six additional loan
production offices in 1998.  Total  operating  expenses were up $13.0 million 
due to expenses  associated  with increased  vehicle sales and the expansion  of
the floorplan  financing  business.  Income tax  expense was $3.1 million higher
in 1998 because of increased operating income.

INVESTMENTS.

   - SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE.  Operating  revenue and income were
     $1.6 million  higher in 1998 due to improved  performance by the securities
     portfolio.  Income from equity  investments  included  $3.9 million in 1998
     ($3.3  million  in 1997)  from the  Company's  investment  in  Capital  Re.
     Together,  the Company's  securities portfolio and its equity investment in
     Capital Re earned an  annualized  after-tax  return of 8.6  percent in 1998
     (7.3 percent in 1997).  Income tax expense was $1.9 million  higher in 1998
     because of increased operating income.

   - REAL  ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Operating  revenue  and income from Real Estate
     Operations  were $3.1  million  higher in 1998 due  primarily  to two large
     sales at Palm Coast and the sale of a partnership interest in a development
     at Lehigh. Combined, the three sales contributed $6.4 million to revenue in
     1998. Total  operating  expenses  (excluding  minority  interest) were $0.5
     million  higher in 1998 due to  expenses  associated  with the three  large
     sales.  Income  tax  expense  was $1.3  million  higher in 1998  because of
     increased operating income.

COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998 AND 1997.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  Operating revenue and income from Electric Operations were
$13.7 million higher in 1998, even though kilowatthour sales remained at similar
levels.  This  increase was  primarily  attributable  to higher sales prices for
power sold to other power suppliers. Average wholesale prices from Company
sales  were up  approximately  40  percent  from  1997 as a  result  of a supply
shortage from storms and hot weather in the Midwest.  In addition,  revenue from
retail and wholesale customers was higher in 1998 due to an increase in the fuel
clause component.  The fuel clause component was higher to allow recovery of the
cost of replacement  power needed during  scheduled  outages at Square Butte and
Boswell. Demand revenue from large power customers was lower in 1998 as a result
of successful  renegotiation  of contracts  which extended the term, but in turn
reduced the demand charge component.  Revenue from residential and gas customers
was $2.8  million  lower in 1998 because of the  unusually  mild winter and warm
spring.  Operating  revenue and income in 1997  included $3.7 million in pre-tax
gains from the sale of rights to  microwave  frequencies  in  accordance  with a
federal mandate and the sale of property along the St. Louis River to ensure the
preservation of wilderness  lands.  Total operating  expenses were $18.3 million
higher  in 1998 due to a $13.4  million  increase  in fuel and  purchased  power
expense.  Fuel  expense  was about  $1.8  million  higher  because of more steam
generation.  Purchased  power expense  increased $11.6 million because of higher
prices in the market, more sales to other power suppliers,  scheduled outages at
Square  Butte and  Boswell,  and less  hydro  generation.  Dry winter and spring
conditions  reduced the Company's  hydro supply.  Operations  expenses were $4.5
million  higher due to  scheduled  outages at Boswell,  consulting  services
and  amortization of deferred  Conservation Improvement Programs costs. Property
taxes were $1.8 million lower in 1998 due to the reform of the Minnesota 
property tax system. Income tax expense was $1.6 million lower in 1998 because 
of lower operating income.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 31 percent of
electric  operating  revenue and income in 1998 (32  percent in 1997).  Electric
sales to paper and pulp mills  accounted  for 11 percent of  electric  operating
revenue and income in 1998 (12 percent in 1997).  Sales to other power suppliers
accounted  for 13 percent of electric  operating  revenue and income in 1998 (10
percent in 1997).

WATER  SERVICES.  Operating  revenue  and income from Water  Services  were $2.6
million  higher in 1998 due  primarily to increased  revenue from  non-regulated
water  subsidiaries.  Consumption,  which was up 5 percent in 1998,  reflected a
September 1997 acquisition of a water utility in North Carolina. Increased sales
of water resulting from drought  conditions in Florida during the second quarter
of 1998  helped to offset  lower sales in the first  quarter of 1998  because of
record  rainfall.  Total  operating  expenses  were $1.0 million  higher in 1998
because of  additional  costs  related to increased  revenue from  non-regulated
water  subsidiaries.  Income tax expense was $0.8 million higher in 1998 because
of increased operating income.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  Operating revenue and income from Automotive Services were
$36.6 million higher in 1998 due to a 15 percent  increase in vehicle sales, and
the expansion and maturing of AFC's floorplan financing business. At ADESA 
auction facilities 450,000 vehicles were sold in 1998 (391,000 in 1997). ADESA 
added three new auction facilities during 1998. AFC had 63 loan production  
offices at June 30, 1998 (50 at June 30, 1997). Nine additional loan production
offices were opened during 1998. In 1997 operating revenue and income included a
gain from the sale of an auction facility.  Total operating  expenses were up 
$25.2 million due to expenses  associated  with increased  vehicle sales and the
expansion of the floorplan  financing  business.  Income tax expense was $4.9
million higher in 1998 because of increased operating income.

INVESTMENTS.

   - SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE.  Operating  revenue and income were
     $4.0 million higher in 1998 due to $3.9 million of dividend income received
     from a venture capital investment.  Income from equity investments included
     $8.1 million in 1998 ($7.3 million in 1997) from the  Company's  investment
     in Capital Re. Together,  the Company's securities portfolio and its equity
     investment  in  Capital  Re earned an  annualized  after-tax  return of 7.2
     percent in 1998 (8.6 percent in 1997).  Income tax expense was $2.9 million
     higher in 1998 because of increased operating income.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

   - REAL  ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Operating  revenue  and income from Real Estate
     Operations  were $6.4  million  higher in 1998 due  primarily to four large
     sales at Palm Coast and the sale of a partnership interest in a development
     at Lehigh. Combined, the five sales contributed $11.5 million to revenue in
     1998.  Total operating  expenses  (excluding  minority  interest) were $0.8
     million  higher  in 1998 due to  expenses  associated  with the five  large
     sales.  Income  tax  expense  was $2.3  million  higher in 1998  because of
     increased operating income.


LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES.  Cash flow from operations  improved during the six months
ended June 30,  1998 due to the  continued  focus on the  management  of working
capital throughout the Company. Cash from operating activities was also affected
by a number of factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 4 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers.  However,  ADESA utilizes proceeds from the
sale of  commercial  paper  issued by the  Company  to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC also uses proceeds  from the sale of commercial  paper issued by the Company
to meet its operational  requirements.  AFC offers short-term  on-site financing
for dealers to purchase vehicles at auctions in exchange for a security interest
in those vehicles. The financing is provided through the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the vehicle or a general  borrowing  term of 30 - 90 days.  At June
30, 1998 AFC had sold $144.0  million  ($124.0  million at December 31, 1997) of
receivables on a revolving basis to a third party purchaser. Under an agreement,
the  purchaser  agrees to  purchase  up to $225.0  million of  receivables  on a
revolving  basis.  Proceeds from the sale of the  receivables  are used to repay
borrowings  from the  Company and fund  vehicle  inventory  purchases  for AFC's
customers.

Significant changes in accounts  receivable,  accounts payable and notes payable
balances at June 30, 1998  compared to December  31, 1997 were due to  increased
sales activity by Automotive Services. Typically auction volumes are down during
the winter  months and in December  because of the holidays.  As a result,  both
ADESA and AFC had lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

Effective  May 8,  1998  AFC  executed  an  Administration  Agreement  with  ADT
Automotive,  Inc. (ADT) which has led to an arrangement whereby AFC will provide
floorplan  financing  services at 26 ADT  auctions.  AFC expects  that these new
office locations will be opened during the last half of 1998. Start-up costs are
not expected to be material.

In May 1998 the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of
1933 with  respect to 3.0 million  original  issue shares of Common  Stock.  The
registration  statement was declared  effective by the SEC on May 18, 1998.  The
Company  expects  to sell  the  registered  Common  Stock  from  time to time as
warranted by market conditions and the Company's capital requirements. The offer
and sale of such shares shall be made only by means of a prospectus.

ADESA  acquired the assets of Greater  Lansing Auto Auction in Lansing, Michigan
and I-55 Auto Auction in St. Louis,  Missouri on April 30, 1998,  and Ark-La-Tex
Auto Auction in  Shreveport,  Louisiana on May 27, 1998 for a combined  purchase
price of $23.8 million.  The Company used internally  generated funds and issued
commercial paper to acquire these assets.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. Consolidated capital expenditures for the six months ended
June 30, 1998 totaled $33.0 million  ($35.8 million in 1997).  Expenditures  for
1998  included  $17.2  million for Electric  Operations,  $7.1 million for Water
Services and $8.7 million for Automotive  Services.  Internally  generated funds
were the primary source for funding these expenditures.


YEAR 2000.  The Year 2000 issue relates to computer  systems that  recognize the
year in a date field using only the last two digits. Unless corrected,  the Year
2000 may be interpreted as 1900 causing errors or shutdowns in computer systems.
In the ordinary course of business, Minnesota Power has recently replaced, or is
in the process of replacing, many of its major computer systems with new systems
that are  represented  by the vendors to be Year 2000  compliant.  These updated
systems handle  important  aspects of Minnesota  Power's  operations,  including
energy management, customer information and financial management. A project team
has been  coordinating  a  comprehensive  review of the  Company's  software and
embedded   microprocessor-based   systems  for  possible  Year  2000  compliance
concerns. Systems so identified are being prioritized, and remediated and tested
accordingly.  The review has included  communications  with key outside entities
with which the Company interacts. Contingency plans are also being developed for
certain critical business  processes.  The Company estimates its cost to prepare
for the Year 2000 will be $6 million to $10 million  over the next two years and
that its systems will be substantially compliant by July 1999.

The electric  industry is unique in its  reliance on the  integrity of the power
pool grid to support and maintain reliable,  efficient operations. The Company's
preparation for the Year 2000 is linked to the Year 2000  compliance  efforts of
other  utilities  as well as those of major  customers  whose loads  support the
integrity of the power pool grid.  Minnesota Power is coordinating its Year 2000
efforts with the plans  established by the North American  Electric  Reliability
Council under the direction of the U.S. Department of Energy and is also working
with a utility  industry  consortium to obtain and share  utility-specific  Year
2000 compliance information.  The main external Year 2000 risk identified by the
Company's other business segments is the potential loss of electrical supply.

The Year 2000 issue may impact other  entities with which the Company  transacts
business.   The  Company  cannot  estimate  or  predict  the  potential  adverse
consequences,  if any, that could result from such entities'  failure to address
this issue.


NEW ACCOUNTING  STANDARD.  In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133), effective for fiscal
years  beginning  after  June 15,  1999.  SFAS 133  establishes  accounting  and
reporting  standards  requiring  that  every  derivative  instrument  (including
certain derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair value.  SFAS 133
requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized  currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are met. Special  accounting
for  qualifying  hedges  allows a  derivative's  gains and  losses to offset the
related results on the hedged item in the income statement,  and requires that a
company  must  formally  document,  designate  and assess the  effectiveness  of
transactions that receive hedge accounting  treatment.  SFAS 133 must be applied
to derivative  instruments and certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid
contracts that were issued,  acquired, or substantively  modified after December
31, 1997. SFAS 133 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company upon
adoption.

Ref. Page 3. - Last Paragraph

As of August 1, 1998 the minimum  annual revenue the Company would collect under
contracts with these large power  customers,  assuming no electric energy use by
these  customers,  is  estimated  to be $105.5,  $79.4,  $71.2,  $67.8 and $57.4
million during the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Based on
past experiences and projected  operating  levels,  the Company believes revenue
from these large power customers will be  substantially in excess of the minimum
contract amounts.

$12.5 million, which included interest, to customers who paid more under uniform
rates.  Upon  issuance of the June 10, 1998 opinion of the Court of Appeals with
respect  to Florida  Water's  1995 Rate Case (see next  paragraph)  in which the
court reversed its previous ruling that the FPSC was without  authority to order
uniform rates,  other customer  groups  supporting the FPSC's January 1998 order
filed a motion  with the Court of  Appeals  seeking  dismissal  of the appeal by
customer groups seeking refunds.  Customers  seeking refunds have filed a motion
requesting  authority to amend their  briefs.  No provision  for refund has been
recorded.  The Company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals
process.

1995 Rate Case

With respect to Florida  Water's  1995 rate case,  on June 10, 1998 the Court of
Appeals  ruled in Florida  Water's  favor on all  material  issues  appealed  by
Florida  Water and  remanded  the matter back to the FPSC for action  consistent
with the Court's  order.  The Court of Appeals also  overturned  its decision in
Florida  Water's 1991 Rate Case which had required a  "functional  relationship"
between  service areas as a  precondition  to  implementation  of uniform rates.
Parties  opposed to the Court of  Appeals'  reversal  of its  previous  decision
regarding  uniform  rates have  requested  rehearing.  The  Company is unable to
predict the timing or outcome of these proceedings.

Ref. Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1998, Page 10. - Fifth Paragraph

On May 13, 1998 the NCUC issued a final order granting Heater a rate increase of
$0.3 million for its water and wastewater customers. Heater had requested an
annual rate increase of $1.1 million;  however, the test year was adjusted for
post-test year customer growth and consumption  which  substantially  decreased
the annual rate increase required. Heater does not plan to appeal this order.

energy under the Minnkota PSA is increased in accordance  with the Minnkota PSA,
Minnesota  Power's  entitlement to Net  Capability  and associated  energy shall
decrease by the amount by which  Minnkota's  entitlement  to Net  Capability and
associated energy under the Minnkota PSA increases  thereunder.  Minnesota Power
shall  transfer  and  assign to  Minnkota,  or shall  receive  and  accept  from

for  Capacity  and  Energy  for each  Month  shall  consist of a share of Square
Butte's Monthly Non-Fuel Costs,  which share shall be determined by applying the
percentage of Net Capability to which Minnesota Power is entitled for such Month
under  Section  3.2 to Square  Butte's  Monthly  Non-Fuel  Costs for such Month;
provided that Minnesota  Power's share of any costs and expenses  incurred prior
to the date  hereof that are a part of Square  Butte's  Monthly  Non-Fuel  Costs
shall be determined by applying the  percentage of its  entitlement to power and
energy from Unit #2, in effect at the time such costs and expenses arose,  under
the Power Sales &  Interconnection  Agreement between Minnesota Power and Square
Butte, dated as of April 1, 1974, to such costs and expenses.

             4.1.2 Square  Butte's  Monthly Fuel Costs.  The Monthly Charge for
Capacity  and Energy for each Month shall  consist of a share of Square  Butte's
Monthly Fuel Costs,  which share shall be determined by applying the  percentage

any  transmission,  transmission  losses,  ancillary  services,  and  any  other
transmission-related  services  associated with making  available such Alternate
Capacity and delivering such Alternate Energy.

             4.1.5 Margin.  The Monthly  Charge for Capacity and Energy for each
Month shall  consist of an amount  equal to a share of five  percent (5%) of the
total of Square  Butte's  costs for such Month  reflected  in Accounts  500, 502
through 599, and 920 through 935 as recorded in the Uniform  System of Accounts,
which share shall be determined by applying the  percentage of Net Capability to
which  Minnesota  Power is  entitled  for such Month  under  Section 3.2 to five
percent (5%) of the total of Square  Butte's  costs for such Month  reflected in
Accounts  500,  502 through  599, and 920 through 935 as recorded in the Uniform
System of Accounts.

         4.2 Estimates of Monthly  Charge.  Prior to the beginning of the first
Contract  Year and on or before  forty-five  (45) days prior to the beginning of
each  Contract  Year  thereafter,  Square  Butte  shall  prepare  and deliver to
Minnesota Power a pro-forma  statement (in a form to be agreed upon by the Joint
Operating  Committee)  showing a detailed  estimate  of the  Monthly  Charge for
Capacity  and Energy for each Month of the  following  Contract  Year which will
establish the basis for Minnesota Power's payment as provided herein.

         4.3 Revised  Estimates.  At the end of the sixth  (6th)  Month of each
Contract Year other than the first Contract Year,  Square Butte shall review its
estimate of the  Monthly  Charge for  Capacity  and Energy for each Month of the
Contract Year, and in the event such estimate does not substantially  correspond
with actual  receipts or  expenditures,  or if there are at any time during such
Contract Year extraordinary  receipts or payments of unusual costs substantially
affecting  the  Monthly  Charge  for  Capacity  and Energy for any Month of such
Contract  Year,  Square  Butte shall  prepare and deliver to  Minnesota  Power a
revised estimate of the Monthly Charge for Capacity and Energy for each Month as
a basis for Minnesota  Power's monthly payments for the balance of that Contract
Year.

         4.4 Suspension of Payment Obligation.

             4.4.1  Obligation to Make Payment.  Except  as  provided in Section
4.4.2, Minnesota Power shall make all payments that are required pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement at such time or times herein provided for such payments,
notwithstanding   (i)  the  non-performance  by  Square  Butte  of  any  of  its
obligations  herein  or  in  the  Joint  Operating  Agreement,  whether  due  to
Uncontrollable  Forces  or  otherwise;  (ii)  the  failure,  inoperativeness  or

<PAGE>

Capacity or to deliver to Minnesota Power Energy or Alternate  Energy (except as
provided in Section 4.4.2);  (iv) the invalidity or  unenforceability or lack of
due  authorization  of  this  Agreement;  or  (v)  any  other  matter  or  event
whatsoever,  including without limitation the bankruptcy or insolvency of Square
Butte or the  disaffirmance  of any agreement by any trustee or receiver,  which
might otherwise  relieve Minnesota Power from the obligation to pay such amounts
at such  times,  notwithstanding  any  present  or future  law to the  contrary.
Minnesota  Power agrees that no such payment by Minnesota Power shall be subject
to any right of set-off or  counterclaim  or any other defense  which  Minnesota
Power may now or hereafter have against  Square Butte.  This Section 4.4.1 shall
not be construed as a guarantee by Minnesota  Power of any  obligation of Square
Butte or to release Square Butte from the  performance of any of its obligations
expressed in this Agreement or, except to the extent expressly  provided in this
Agreement,  prevent or restrict Minnesota Power from asserting any rights it may
have against Square Butte under this Agreement.

             4.4.2  Suspension  of Payment  Obligation.  Minnesota  Power's
obligation to pay charges under Section 4.1 shall be suspended only in the event
that Square Butte fails to deliver any Energy or Alternate Energy  whatsoever to
any  Delivery  Point  for a period  of  twelve  (12)  consecutive  Months.  Such
suspension,  if any, shall begin at 12:01 a.m. CPT of the first (1st) day of the
Month  following  such twelve (12) Month period,  and shall  continue until such
time as Square Butte shall resume the delivery to Minnesota  Power of any Energy
or any Alternate  Energy at any Delivery  Point;  provided,  however,  that such
suspension  shall not relieve  Minnesota Power of its obligation to make payment
of  the  Monthly   Charges  for  Capacity  and  Energy  incurred  prior  to  the
commencement of such suspension.

                                    ARTICLE V
                               BILLING AND PAYMENT

         5.1 Billing  Statement.  On the first (1st) day of each Month beginning
with the initial Month of the first Contract Year,  Square Butte shall render to
Minnesota Power a monthly statement showing the amount of the Monthly Charge for
Capacity  and Energy for the Month  during  which such  statement is rendered as
shown in the  pro-forma  estimate of the Monthly  Charge for Capacity and Energy
for such Month or any revisions  thereof,  furnished by Square Butte pursuant to
Section 4.2 and Section 4.3. Square Butte also shall set forth in such statement
the charges for any  Alternate  Capacity  and/or  Alternate  Energy  provided by
Square Butte to Minnesota  Power in the preceding  Month,  including any charges
for  transmission  and   transmission-related   services  associated  with  such
Alternate  Capacity  and/or  Alternate  Energy,  and any other  charges due from
Minnesota Power to Square Butte.

         5.2 Payment Due Date. The pro-forma  estimate of the Monthly Charge for
Capacity and Energy  submitted  pursuant to Section 5.1, plus an adjustment  for
the  difference  between  the prior  Month's  pro-forma  estimate of the Monthly
Charge for Capacity and Energy and the prior Month's  actual  Monthly Charge for
Capacity and Energy,  and any other amounts due from  Minnesota  Power to Square
Butte,  shall be due and payable  from  Minnesota  Power to Square  

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

Butte on the  twentieth  (20th)  day after  the date the  monthly  statement  is
rendered. Fixed Charges shall be paid on the due date of such Fixed Charges.

         5.3 Failure to Make Payment.  Square Butte may, whenever any amount due
remains  unpaid  subsequent  to the  fifteenth  (15th)  day  after the due date,
discontinue  deliveries  to Minnesota  Power until such bill and any  subsequent
payments which have become due are paid. No such discontinuance shall be treated
as a failure on the part of Square  Butte to make Net  Capability  or  Alternate
Capacity  available or to deliver Energy or Alternate  Energy to Minnesota Power
or otherwise  relieve  Minnesota  Power from any of its  obligations  under this
Agreement. During any such discontinuance,  for purposes of Section 4.1, if Unit
#2 is capable of producing all or part of the Net Capability and Energy to which
Minnesota  Power is entitled under Section 3.2,  Square Butte shall be deemed to
have made available to Minnesota Power such Net Capability and to have delivered
to Minnesota Power at the Delivery Point such Energy.

         5.4 Billing  Disputes.  In the event of any dispute  between  Minnesota
Power and Square  Butte as to any  portion of any monthly  statement,  Minnesota
Power shall pay the full amount of the charges when due. As soon as  practicable
after the date of the disputed bill or an audit exception, Minnesota Power shall
give  written  notice of the dispute or audit  exception to Square  Butte.  Such
notice shall  identify the  disputed  bill,  state the amount in dispute and set
forth a full  statement  of the  grounds  on which  such  dispute  is based.  No
adjustment  shall be  considered or made for disputed  charges  unless notice is
given as aforesaid within  twenty-four (24) Months after the date of the monthly
statement.  The dispute  shall then be resolved in  accordance  with the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in Article XIV.

         5.5 Annual Statement.  On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after
the end of each Contract  Year,  Square Butte shall submit to Minnesota  Power a
detailed  statement of the actual  aggregate  amount of the Monthly  Charges for
Capacity and Energy for all of the Months for the prior Contract Year,  based on
the annual audit of accounts  provided for in Section 11.1.  If, on the basis of
the  statement  submitted as provided in this Section 5.5, the actual  aggregate
amount of the Monthly  Charges for  Capacity  and Energy for the prior  Contract
Year  exceeds  the amount  paid  therefor by  Minnesota  Power  (based on Square
Butte's estimate and revision,  if any,  provided in accordance with Section 4.2
and Section 4.3),  Minnesota Power shall pay Square Butte promptly the amount to
which  Square  Butte is entitled.  If, on the basis of the  statement  submitted
pursuant to this Section 5.5, the actual aggregate amount of the Monthly Charges
for Capacity and Energy for the prior Contract Year is less than the amount paid
therefor by Minnesota Power (based on Square Butte's  estimate and revision,  if
any,  provided in  accordance  with Section 4.2 and Section  4.3),  Square Butte
shall credit such excess  against  Minnesota  Power's  next  monthly  payment or
payments pursuant to Section 5.1.

         5.6 Overpayments and  Underpayments.  If at the end of the term of this
Agreement  there are monies or credits  remaining  with  Square  Butte which are
overpayments  by Minnesota  Power under this  Agreement,  or if Minnesota  Power
should owe Square Butte monies by virtue of the  provisions  of this  Agreement,
such  settlements  will be made by the Parties  pursuant to bills  rendered  and
promptly paid.

                            METERING AND TRANSMISSION

         10.1 Metering  Equipment.  Square Butte shall provide and maintain,  as
agreed upon by the Parties, suitable metering equipment at Unit #2 and on the AC
Transmission  Facilities to indicate,  record and telemeter Net  Capability  and
Energy.  Periodic tests and inspections of such metering equipment shall be made
at  reasonable  intervals  as agreed  upon by the  Parties to ensure  that their
accuracy of  registration  is  maintained  in  accordance  with Prudent  Utility
Practice.  The  expense  involved in such tests shall be included in the Monthly
Charges for Capacity and Energy.  On the request of either Party,  special tests
shall  be made at the  requesting  Party's  expense.  Each  Party  shall  afford
opportunity  to  representatives  of the other to be present  at all  regular or
special  tests,  if desired.  If any test of  metering  equipment  discloses  an
inaccuracy exceeding two percent (2%) above or below the equipment's  calibrated
standards,  the Parties shall be promptly  notified and the account  between the
Parties for service  supplied shall be adjusted  appropriately.  Such correction
and  adjustment  shall be made in the  billing  from the date the  meter  became
inaccurate,  if known;  if such date cannot be determined,  then such adjustment
shall be made for the  previous  Month or from the date of the latest  test,  if
within the previous Month,  and for the elapsed period in the Month during which
the test was made. Should any metering equipment at any time fail to register or
should the  registration  thereof be so  erratic as to be  meaningless,  the Net

perform its obligations hereunder, such Party shall be liable to the other Party
for direct actual damages for such failure to perform.  In the case of a failure
to perform by Minnesota  Power,  such direct  actual  damages are in addition to
Minnesota  Power's  payment  obligations  under  Article  IV. In no event  shall
Minnesota Power be relieved of its  obligations  under Article IV as a result of
its payment of such direct actual damages.

         13.3 Uncontrollable Forces.

              13.3.1 Performance Excused.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, the performance of the obligations set forth in this Agreement (other
than the payment of any monies due  hereunder)  shall be suspended or excused in
the event that such performance is adversely affected by an Uncontrollable Force
or its adverse  effects;  provided,  however,  that nothing in this Section 13.3
shall excuse Minnesota Power from its obligations under Section 4.1.

              13.3.2 Obligation  to  Remove Disability.  A Party affected by an
Uncontrollable  Force shall use due  diligence  to place itself in a position to
fulfill its  obligations  hereunder,  and if unable to fulfill any obligation by
reason of an  Uncontrollable  Force,  such Party shall exercise due diligence to
remove such disability at the earliest practicable time.

              13.3.3 Actions  of  Third  Parties. The action or inaction of any

         14.1 Dispute Resolution.  In the event of a dispute between the Parties
arising out of the performance or non-performance of this Agreement, the Parties
will in good faith negotiate to resolve such dispute.  If the Parties are unable
to resolve the dispute through such good faith negotiations  within a reasonable
amount of time,  then the  dispute  shall be subject to the  dispute  resolution
procedures set forth herein.

         14.2 Mediation.   If  the  Parties  are  unable  through  good  faith
negotiations  between  themselves  to  resolve  such a  dispute,  then they will
endeavor to resolve the dispute by mediation in good faith  accordance  with the
Commercial  Mediation  Rules of the  American  Arbitration  Association  then in
effect,  and this shall be a  condition  precedent  to the  commencement  of any
arbitration.

         14.3 Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating
to this  Agreement or the breach of any part  thereof,  or appeal from action of
one of the Parties to this Agreement,  which is not resolved  through good faith
negotiations or mediation between the Parties,  shall be settled by arbitration,
in accordance with the following procedures.

              14.3.1 Arbitration  Rules. Such  arbitration  shall  be  conducted
before a single arbitrator selected by the American Arbitration  Association and
the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American  Arbitration  Association  then in effect,  subject to the
further  qualification  that the  arbitrator  named  under said  rules  shall be
unbiased and qualified by virtue of education and  experience in the  particular
matter subject to arbitration.

              14.3.2 Notice.  The Party desiring  arbitration shall demand such
arbitration by giving written  notice to the other Party  involved.  Such notice
shall conform to the  procedures  of the American  Arbitration  Association  and
shall include a statement of the facts or circumstances  causing the controversy
and the  resolution,  determination  or  relief  sought  by the  Party  desiring
arbitration.

              14.3.3 Pre-Arbitration Conference. Before the matter is presented
to the  arbitrator,  a  conference  shall be held to  stipulate as many facts as
possible and to clarify and narrow the issues to be submitted to arbitration.

              14.3.4 Authority of Arbitrators.  The arbitrator shall have no
authority,  power or jurisdiction to alter,  amend,  change,  modify,  add to or
subtract  from any of the  provisions  of this  Agreement,  nor to consider  any
issues  arising other than from the language in and authority  derived from this
Agreement.

              14.3.5 Decision or Award. The decision or award  of the arbitrator
shall be final and binding upon the Parties and the Parties shall do such acts 
as the  arbitration  decision or 

                                      -19-

award may require of them.  Judgment upon any award  rendered by the  arbitrator
may be entered in any court having  jurisdiction  and execution  issued thereon.
This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

              14.3.6  Costs. Cost of the arbitration shall be shared equally 
unless the award shall specify a different division of cost.

                                   ARTICLE XV
                                   ASSIGNMENT

         15.1 Permitted  Assignments.  Subject to any additional limitations set
forth in the  Indenture  and except as  provided  in Section  15.1.1 and Section
15.1.2, neither Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

              15.1.1  Assignment by Square Butte.  Minnesota Power agrees to
Square Butte's sale, transfer and assignment of its right, title and interest in
this  Agreement,  including  any  and  all  extensions,   renewals,  amendments,
modifications and supplements hereto, and all amounts due hereunder, as security
for its obligations,  without such assignees assuming or becoming in any respect
obligated to perform any of the obligations of Square Butte  hereunder,  and, if
any such assignee be a  corporation,  without its being  required by the Parties
hereto to  qualify to do  business  in the State of North  Dakota,  and any such
assignee may  transfer,  convey and assign all of its right,  title and interest
in, to or by virtue of this Agreement in connection with any proceeding (whether
or not  judicial) to realize on any security  interests  granted to it to secure
Square Butte's  obligations to any purchaser of any part of the property subject
to such  security  interests,  or exercise  any other  remedy  permitted  by the
documents governing its security interests. This Agreement may not be terminated
other than in accordance  with its terms,  and the terms and  provisions of this
Agreement  may not be amended,  altered,  modified or waived except as permitted
under  the  Indenture.  No such  assignment  for  security  shall  impose on any
assignee  any  of  the  duties,  obligations  or  liabilities  of  Square  Butte
hereunder, but the assignee shall acquire thereby all the rights of Square Butte
hereunder as shall be  necessary  for it to collect and receive all such amounts
payable  hereunder,  so as to constitute  such assignee the  beneficiary  of the
obligations of Minnesota  Power set forth  hereunder.  Minnesota Power agrees to
execute and cooperate in filing any  acknowledgment or consent to any assignment
as described above.

              15.1.2  Assignment by Minnesota Power.  Square Butte agrees to the
assignment by Minnesota Power of this Agreement and Minnesota Power's respective
rights hereunder, but not to the delegation by Minnesota Power of its respective
obligations hereunder, to an Affiliate of Minnesota Power.
