                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"
"expects,"  "intends,"  "plans,"  "predicts,"  "projects," "will likely result,"
"will continue," or similar  expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

     -  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those
        those of Congress, state legislatures, the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the
        NCUC,  the PSCW and various county  regulators,  with respect to allowed
        rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal
        of  assets  and   facilities,   operation  and   construction  of  plant
        facilities,  recovery of purchased  power and capital  investments,  and
        present or prospective  wholesale and retail competition  (including but
        not limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs);
     -  economic and geographic factors including political and economic risks;
     -  changes  in and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws  and
        policies;
     -  weather conditions;
     -  population growth rates and demographic patterns;
     -  competition for retail and wholesale customers;
     -  pricing and transportation of commodities;
     -  market demand, including structural market changes;
     -  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
     -  changes in project costs;
     -  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
     -  capital market conditions;
     -  competition for new energy development opportunities; and
     -  legal and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal) and
        settlements  that  influence  the  business  and  profitability  of  the
        Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of these  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of these
factors on the  business or the extent to which any factor,  or  combination  of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS

FLORIDA WATER 1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Florida First  District Court
of Appeals (Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform
rates for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With  "uniform  rates" all
customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and  wastewater
services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
ordered  Florida Water to issue  refunds to those  customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge to  customers  who paid
less under uniform rates. Florida Water appealed, and the Court of Appeals ruled
in June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without balancing surcharges.
In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC issued an order in January
1998 that did not require refunds. Florida Water's potential refund liability at
that time was about $12.5  million,  which included  interest,  to customers who
paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund,  with
interest,  $2.5 million, the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service
area from January 1996 through June 1997 under uniform rates which  exceeded the
amount  these  customers  would  have paid  under a  modified  stand-alone  rate
structure.  No balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund
because  Spring  Hill  customers  continued  to pay  uniform  rates  after other
customers  began  paying  modified  stand-alone  rates  effective  January  1996
pursuant to the FPSC's interim rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case. The
FPSC did not include  Spring Hill in this  interim rate order  because  Hernando
County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida
Water  reached an agreement  with  Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to
stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund because the FPSC
had no  authority  to order  uniform  rates.  The Company has  appealed the $2.5
million  refund order.  Initial briefs were filed by all parties in May 1998. In
June 1998 the Court of Appeals  reversed its  previous  ruling that the FPSC was
without  authority  to  order  uniform  rates  at  which  time  customer  groups
supporting  the  FPSC's  January  1998  order  filed a motion  with the Court of
Appeals  seeking  dismissal of the appeal by customer  groups  seeking  refunds.
Customers  seeking  refunds filed amended briefs in September  1998. A provision
for refund  related to the $2.5  million  refund order was recorded in the third
quarter of 1999. A decision is not expected  before 2001.  The Company is unable
to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

exceeded  the  average  market  price  of  the  Company's  stock.  There  was no
difference  between  basic and  diluted  earnings  per share for the nine months
ended September 30, 1999 or the three months ended September 30, 1999 and 2000.

The Company  paid  dividends  on  preferred  stock of $0.1 million for the three

NOTE 10.     SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company  has a power  purchase  agreement  with  Square  Butte that  extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in the Company's electric service territory and enables the Company to
meet power pool reserve  requirements.  Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center,
North Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit owned by Minnkota Power
Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative corporation whose Class
A members are also members of Square Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of
the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

The Company is entitled to  approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under
the Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance notice
requirement,  Minnkota has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement  by 5
percent  annually,  to a minimum of 50 percent.  The Company is obligated to pay
its pro rata share of Square Butte's costs based on the Company's entitlement to
Unit output. The Company's payment obligation is suspended if Square Butte fails
to deliver any power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one year.
Square Butte's fixed costs consist  primarily of debt service.  At September 30,
2000 Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $329.4  million.  Total annual
debt  service for Square  Butte is expected to be  approximately  $36 million in
each of the years 2000 through 2003 and $23 million in 2004.  Variable operating
costs  include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI Coal, a subsidiary  of the

approved as purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and
FERC.

Floating Rate First  Mortgage  Bonds,  due October 20, 2003. The Company has the
option to redeem these bonds on or after  October 20, 2001,  in whole or in part

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ALLETE is a  multi-services  company with operations in four business  segments:
(1) Energy Services,  which include  electric and gas services,  coal mining and
telecommunications;  (2) Automotive Services, which include a network of vehicle
auctions,  a finance company,  an auto transport company, a vehicle  remarketing
company  and a company  that  provides  field  information  services;  (3) Water
Services,  which include water and  wastewater  services;  and (4)  Investments,
which  include  real estate  operations,  investments  in emerging  technologies
relating to the electric industry and a securities portfolio.  Corporate charges
represent  general  corporate  expenses,  including  interest,  not specifically
related to any one business segment.

CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW

Net income and earnings per share for the three months ended  September 30, 2000
continued  the strong  performance  of the same period in 1999,  though a cooler
summer  resulted  in lower  income  at  Energy  Services  from  wholesale  power
marketing.

For the nine months  ended  September  30, 2000 the Company  reported  continued
strong performance across all business segments, though a cooler summer resulted
in lower income at Energy Services from wholesale power  marketing.  Significant
acquisitions   and  growth  in  Automotive   Services  and  the  performance  of
Investments  contributed  to higher  operating  results in 2000.  Excluding  the
Capital Re and ACE  transactions  (see net income  discussion for Capital Re and
ACE Transactions  below),  net income and earnings per share for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 increased 22 percent and 20 percent, respectively, over
the same period in 1999.

NET INCOME

The following net income discussion  summarizes  significant events for the nine
months ended September 30, 2000.

ENERGY SERVICES reflected lower net income in 2000 primarily due to lower demand
for  electricity  in the  region's  wholesale  power  market as a result of more
moderate summer weather.  Transmission  constraints  were also a factor in 2000.
Total retail  megawatthour  sales  exceeded  record levels that were achieved in
1999.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  reported  higher net income in 2000 due to increased sales
activity at ADESA auction  facilities and increased  financing activity at AFC's
loan  production  offices.  During 2000 ADESA  acquired or opened 19 new vehicle
auction   facilities  and  completed  the  acquisition  of  11  salvage  auction
facilities.  Same store growth at ADESA auction facilities  increased 13 percent
as measured by earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation,  amortization and
lease expense.

WATER  SERVICES  generated  higher  net  income in 2000 due to  increased  water
consumption  as a result  of  drier  weather  conditions  and  customer  growth,
regulatory   relief   granted  by   Florida's   Hillsborough   Board  of  County
Commissioners  in 2000 and higher rates approved by the FPSC in 1999. Net income
in 1999 also included the recognition of regulatory relief granted by the FPSC.

INVESTMENTS  reported higher net income in 2000 because of significant  sales by
the  Company's  real  estate  operations,  improved  returns  on  the  Company's
securities portfolio and earnings on investments in emerging technologies.

CORPORATE  CHARGES in 2000  reflected  the reversal of  previously  recorded tax
reserves related to various Federal and state tax issues.

CAPITAL RE AND ACE TRANSACTIONS. In May 2000 ALLETE recorded a $30.4 million, or
$0.44 per share,  after-tax  gain on the sale of the 4.7  million  shares of ACE
that  ALLETE  received in  December  1999 when  Capital Re merged with ACE. As a
result of the merger,  in 1999  ALLETE  recorded a $36.2  million,  or $0.52 per
share,  after-tax  non-cash  charge as follows:  a $24.1  million,  or $0.35 per
share,  charge  in  the  second  quarter  following  the  merger  agreement  and
discontinuance  of  ALLETE's  equity  accounting  for  Capital  Re;  and a $12.1
million, or $0.17 per share, charge in the fourth quarter upon completion of the
merger.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2000,  income tax expense included $17.6
million related to the ACE transaction.  For the nine months ended September 30,
1999,  income tax  expense  included  $7.9  million  related  to the  Capital Re
transaction.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND 1999

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES operating revenue was down $8.7 million,  or 6 percent,  in 2000
primarily  because of a softer  wholesale  market.  Wholesale prices and volumes
were down from last year  primarily due to lower demand for  electricity  in the
region's  wholesale  power market as a result of more moderate  summer  weather.
Transmission constraints were also a factor in 2000. The decrease in revenue was
partially  offset  by a 13  percent  increase  in  megawatthour  sales to retail
customers and higher gas revenue.  Higher demand from large industrial customers
led to the increase in retail megawatthour sales.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 13 percent of
consolidated  operating revenue in 2000 (10 percent in 1999).  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated  operating  revenue
in both 2000 and 1999. Sales to other power suppliers accounted for 7 percent of
consolidated operating revenue in 2000 (16 percent in 1999).

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES operating revenue was up $31.9 million,  or 30 percent,  in
2000  primarily  due to a 23 percent  increase in vehicles  sold  through  ADESA
auction  facilities and a 7 percent increase in the number of vehicles  financed
at AFC loan production  offices.  At ADESA auction  facilities  337,000 vehicles
were sold in 2000 (274,000 in 1999). The increase in vehicles sold was primarily
attributable  to new  auctions  acquired  or opened in 1999 and 2000.  Financial
results for 2000 included  three months of operations  for one auction  facility
acquired  in February  2000,  two auction  facilities  opened in April 2000,  11
salvage auctions acquired in May 2000 and 13 auction facilities acquired in June
2000.  Financial  results  for 2000  also  reflected  less  than two  months  of
operations  for three auction  facilities  acquired in August 2000. AFC financed
approximately  198,000  vehicles  in 2000  (186,000  in  1999).  AFC had 86 loan
production offices at September 30, 2000 (84 at September 30, 1999).

WATER SERVICES  operating revenue was down $0.9 million,  or 3 percent,  in 2000
primarily due to the recognition of $2.7 million of regulatory relief granted by
the FPSC in 1999.  Water  consumption  was up 5 percent in 2000 because of drier
weather  conditions  in  Florida.  Customer  growth and the  inclusion  of water
systems  acquired during 1999 and early 2000 also contributed to the increase in
water consumption.  In addition,  revenue in 2000 was $1.0 million higher due to
regulatory   relief   granted  by   Florida's   Hillsborough   Board  of  County
Commissioners  in 2000 and $0.3 million  higher due to higher rates  approved by
the FPSC in 1999.

INVESTMENTS  operating revenue was down $6.8 million, or 41 percent, in 2000 due
to the timing of commercial  real estate sales in Florida.  The  Company's  real
estate  operations  reported strong sales during the first half of 2000. In 1999
the Company's real estate  operations  recorded two  significant  sales totaling
$6.9 million.

OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY SERVICES operating expenses were up $4.5 million in 2000 due to increased
fuel and  purchased  power  expenses.  Fuel  expense was up $1.3 million in 2000
because the Company paid higher prices for coal. In 2000 purchased power expense
was up $1.6  million due to purchased  gas and $3.9 million  because the Company
purchased 218,000, or 42 percent, more megawatthours.  During 2000 generation at
the Company's hydro plants was down 130,000 megawatthours due to lack of rain in
the Midwest.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  operating expenses were up $24.5 million in 2000 primarily
due to the  inclusion of new vehicle  auction  facilities  acquired or opened in
late 1999 and 2000.  Increased sales activity at existing auction facilities and
financing activity at AFC also increased operating expenses in 2000.

WATER  SERVICES  operating  expenses  were down $0.7 million in 2000 due to cost
control efforts.

INVESTMENTS operating expenses were down $3.1 million in 2000 due to fewer sales
by the Company's real estate operations.

COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND 1999

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES operating revenue was up $4.3 million, or 1 percent, in 2000 due
to a 7 percent  increase in retail  megawatthour  sales because of higher demand
from large  industrial  customers and additional gas revenue.  This increase was
partially  offset by fewer  sales from  wholesale  power  marketing  activities.
Wholesale  prices and volumes  were down from last year  because of lower demand
for  electricity  in the  region's  wholesale  power  market as a result of more
moderate summer weather. Transmission constraints were also a factor in 2000.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 13 percent of
consolidated  operating  revenue in both 2000 and 1999.  Electric sales to paper
and pulp mills accounted for 5 percent of consolidated operating revenue in both
2000 and  1999.  Sales to other  power  suppliers  accounted  for 6  percent  of
consolidated operating revenue in 2000 (10 percent in 1999).

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES operating revenue was up $80.3 million,  or 26 percent,  in
2000 primarily due to a 17 percent  increase in both vehicles sold through ADESA
auction  facilities and the number of vehicles  financed at AFC loan  production
offices. At ADESA auction facilities 940,000 vehicles were sold in 2000 (804,000
in 1999).  The  increase  in vehicles  sold was  primarily  attributable  to new
auctions  acquired  or  opened  in 1999 and  2000.  Financial  results  for 2000
included nine months of operations for two auction facilities  acquired in 1999,
eight months of operations for one auction  facility  acquired in February 2000,
six months of operations for two auction  facilities  opened in April 2000, four
months of  operations  for 11 salvage  auctions  acquired  in May 2000 and three
months of operations for 13 auction facilities acquired in June 2000.  Financial
results  for 2000 also  reflected  less than two months of operations  for three
auction facilities acquired in August 2000. AFC financed  approximately  595,000
vehicles  in 2000  (509,000  in 1999).  AFC had 86 loan  production  offices  at
September 30, 2000 (84 at September 30, 1999).

WATER  SERVICES  operating  revenue was up $4.5 million,  or 5 percent,  in 2000
because of a 10 percent increase in water consumption. Drier weather conditions,
customer  growth and the  inclusion of water  systems  acquired  during 1999 and
early 2000 led to the increase in water  consumption.  In  addition,  revenue in
2000 was $1.0  million  higher due to  regulatory  relief  granted by  Florida's
Hillsborough  Board of County  Commissioners in 2000 and $0.8 million higher due
to higher  rates  approved by the FPSC in 1999.  Revenue in 1999  reflected  the
recognition of $2.7 million of regulatory relief granted by the FPSC.

INVESTMENTS operating revenue was up $39.2 million in 2000. Significant sales by
the Company's real estate  operations  were the primary reason for the increase.
In 2000 seven  large sales  contributed  $31.9  million to revenue.  In 1999 two
large sales  contributed  $6.9  million to revenue.  Improved  returns  from the
securities  portfolio and $5.5 million more income from  investments in emerging
technologies  also contributed to higher  operating  revenue from Investments in
2000. The Company's  securities  portfolio recorded an after-tax return of 7% in
2000 (3.58% in 1999).

OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY SERVICES  operating  expenses were up $16.5 million in 2000 primarily due
to increased fuel and purchased  power  expenses.  Fuel expense was $7.1 million
higher in 2000  because the Company  paid higher  prices for coal and  generated
415,000, or 9 percent, more megawatthours to meet the higher requirements of the
Company's  industrial  customers.  In 2000  purchased  power expense was up $4.8
million due to purchased gas and $4.9 million  because of higher prices paid for
purchased power.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  operating expenses were up $65.6 million in 2000 primarily
due to the  inclusion of new vehicle  auction  facilities  acquired or opened in
1999 and 2000.  Increased sales activity at the auction facilities and increased
financing activity at AFC also increased operating expenses in 2000.

WATER  SERVICES  operating  expenses  were up $3.4  million  in 2000  due to the
inclusion  of water  systems  acquired  in the second  quarter of 1999 and early
2000.

INVESTMENTS  operating expenses were up $14.5 million in 2000 due to the cost of
property sold by the Company's real estate operations.

OUTLOOK

CORPORATE  OUTLOOK.  On September 1, 2000 the Company began doing business under
the name  ALLETE  with a new  ticker  symbol  (NYSE:  ALE).  This  reflects  the
Company's success at its strategic objective of transitioning from a diversified
electric company to a multi-services  company. The significant investment in new
vehicle  auction  facilities  during 2000 will contribute to ALLETE's growth and
profitability  strategy  and is  expected to increase  the  Company's  growth in
operating earnings from 10 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2001.

ENERGY  SERVICES.  As  the  electric  industry  continues  to  restructure,  the
contribution  from Energy  Services is expected to remain stable.  Approximately
half of the  electricity  the Company  sells is to large  industrial  customers,
primarily taconite producers, which have long-term  all-requirements  contracts.
Approximately  80 percent of the ore consumed by integrated  steel facilities in
the Great Lakes region originates from five taconite customers of the Company.

Overall,  the domestic steel industry continues to face price  deterioration and
high levels of imported products. Through August 2000 the United States imported
over 27  million  net tons of steel.  This level of imports is almost 17 percent
higher than the same period in 1999 and remains  almost 3 percent higher than in
1998, a crisis year for the  industry.  When  annualized,  this level of imports
equates to an estimated 41  million-ton  year,  just  slightly  less than 1998's
import  record of 41.5  million net tons.  The  average  value of all steel mill
product  imports has declined to about $70 per ton, or 15.4  percent,  below the
pre-crisis value in first quarter 1998.

Although  imports  remain high,  shipments  of steel from U.S.  steel mills have
stayed  moderately  strong.  In the first eight months of 2000, U.S. steel mills
shipped 75.6 million net tons, up 10.7 percent from the same period in 1999 when
68.3 million net tons were shipped.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES. ADESA is the second largest and the fastest growing vehicle
auction business in North America.  In May 2000 ADESA purchased the remaining 27
percent  ownership  in Impact  Auto,  which  added 11  salvage  auctions  to the
Automotive Services segment.  The June 2000 acquisition of AFG added 13 Canadian
vehicle auction facilities and associated dealer financing business to ADESA and
established ADESA as the premier  automotive  services company in Canada.  ADESA
also  acquired  three  other  vehicle  auction  facilities  in  August  2000 and
completed the  acquisition of nine vehicle  auction  facilities  from Manheim in
October 2000. These acquisitions are expected to increase the number of vehicles
sold by 60  percent in the near term with  additional  growth  potential  in the
future.  ADESA  currently  owns or  leases,  and  operates  57  vehicle  auction
facilities  throughout the United States and Canada. By the end of 2000 AFC will
exit all the ADT auctions  acquired by Manheim where AFC now has loan production
offices.  AFC plans to continue to serve these areas from newly established loan
production offices or from other existing offices.  AFC does not anticipate that
the relocations will have a material financial impact.

WATER  SERVICES  includes  the largest  investor  owned water  utilities in both
Florida  and  North  Carolina.  The  Company  continues  to  position  itself by
selectively  acquiring  targeted  water systems and  developing a  non-regulated
presence in the contract maintenance  business.  Both Florida and North Carolina
are currently  experiencing  rapid population  growth which should contribute to
annual customer growth of 4 to 7 percent, respectively, over the next two years.

INVESTMENTS.  Over the last 5 years, sales by real estate operations have been 3
to 4 times more than the acquisition cost of property sold, creating strong cash
generation  and  profitability.  The real estate  strategy  is to acquire  large
portfolios of property, add value and resell them at going market prices.

                                       -14-

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW  ACTIVITIES.  Cash flow from  operations  during the nine months ended
September 30, 2000 reflected  improved  operating results and continued focus on
working capital management.  Cash from operating activities was also affected by
a number of factors representative of normal operations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided  by  the  sale  of  commercial  paper.  Securities  investments  can be
liquidated  to  provide  funds  for  reinvestment  in  existing   businesses  or
acquisition of new businesses.  Approximately 6 million original issue shares of
Common Stock are available for issuance  through  Invest  Direct,  the Company's
direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for  services  provided.  However,  ADESA has  arrangements  to use the
proceeds  from  the sale of  commercial  paper  issued  by the  Company  to meet
short-term  working  capital  requirements  arising  from the  timing of payment
obligations  to vehicle  sellers  and the  availability  of funds  from  vehicle
purchasers.  During the sales  process,  ADESA does not typically  take title to
vehicles.

AFC also has  arrangements  to use proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper
issued  by  the  Company  to  meet  its  operational  requirements.  AFC  offers
short-term  on-site  financing  for dealers to purchase  vehicles at auctions in
exchange for a security  interest in those  vehicles.  The financing is provided
through  the  earlier  of the date the  dealer  sells the  vehicle  or a general
borrowing  term of 30 to 45 days.  AFC sells certain  finance  receivables  on a
revolving  basis to a wholly owned,  unconsolidated,  qualified  special purpose
subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn sells,  on a revolving  basis, an undivided
interest  in  eligible  finance  receivables,  up to a  maximum  at any one time
outstanding of $300 million,  to third party purchasers under an agreement which
expires at the end of 2002. At September 30, 2000 AFC had sold $363.6 million of
finance  receivables  to the  special  purpose  subsidiary  ($296.8  million  at
December 31, 1999).  Third party purchasers had purchased an undivided  interest
in finance  receivables  of $257 million from this  subsidiary  at September 30,
2000 ($225 million at December 31, 1999). Unsold finance receivables held by the
special  purpose  subsidiary  are  recorded by AFC as residual  interest at fair
value.  Fair  value  is  based  upon  estimates  of  future  cash  flows,  using
assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use to value  such  instruments,
including   estimates  of  anticipated  credit  losses  over  the  life  of  the
receivables  sold; a discount rate was not used due to the short-term  nature of
the receivables  sold. The fair value of AFC's residual interest was $92 million
at September 30, 2000 ($57.6  million at December 31,  1999).  Proceeds from the
sale of the receivables  were used to repay borrowings from the Company and fund
vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
September 30, 2000 compared to December 31, 1999 were due to increased sales and
financing  activity at Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are down
during the winter months and in December  because of the holidays.  As a result,
both ADESA and AFC had lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

SALE OF  INVESTMENTS.  In May 2000 ALLETE  sold its 4.7  million  shares of ACE.
ALLETE  received  the ACE shares and $25 million in cash in  December  1999 when
Capital  Re merged  with ACE.  Prior to the  merger,  ALLETE  owned 7.3  million
shares, or 20 percent, of Capital Re. The $127 million in proceeds from the sale
of ACE  shares  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of a  portion  of the  Company's
securities portfolio were used to fund the acquisitions of AFG and Impact Auto.

ACQUISITIONS.  In February 2000 ADESA purchased the Mission City Auto Auction in
San Diego,  California.  The Mission City auction,  which has been renamed ADESA
San Diego,  operates  six  auction  lanes on 30 acres  with full  reconditioning
facilities.

In May 2000 ADESA  Canada  purchased  the  remaining  27 percent of Impact Auto.
ADESA Canada  acquired 20 percent of Impact Auto on October 1, 1995,  27 percent
in March 1999 and another 26 percent in January 2000. Impact is Canada's largest
national  salvage  auction  chain with 11 sites in six  provinces.  Impact  Auto
provides  remarketing  services to  insurance  companies  for their "total loss"
vehicles.

                                       -15-
<PAGE>

In June 2000 ADESA  acquired all of the  outstanding  common  shares of AFG. AFG
owns CAAG Auto  Auction  Holdings  Ltd.  which was doing  business  as  Canadian
Auction  Group.  This  acquisition  added  13  vehicle  auction  facilities  and
associated  dealer  financing   business  to  ADESA's  existing   locations  and
established ADESA as the premier automotive services company in Canada.

In August 2000 ADESA purchased Beebe Auto Exchange, Inc. (Beebe). Beebe operated
two Arkansas auto auctions,  Mid-Ark Auto Auction (renamed ADESA Little Rock) in
North Little Rock and Central  Arkansas  Auto  Auction  (renamed  ADESA  Central
Arkansas) in Beebe,  Arkansas.  ADESA Little Rock  operates ten auction lanes on
approximately 81 acres and ADESA Central Arkansas  operates six auction lanes on
approximately 66 acres. Together,  these auctions sold more than 40,000 vehicles
in 1999. This purchase strengthens ADESA's presence in the South and complements
existing  auctions in  Shreveport,  Memphis,  Dallas,  Houston,  San Antonio and
Austin.

In August 2000 ADESA acquired 51 percent of Interstate  Auto Auction  located in
Ocala,  Florida.  Interstate  Auto Auction,  which was renamed A & H, LLC and is
doing business as ADESA Ocala, operates five auction lanes on 26.5 acres.

The  transactions  described  in the five  preceding  paragraphs  had a combined
purchase  price of  approximately  $183.9  million.  The  Company  funded  these
transactions  with proceeds from the sale of ACE shares,  proceeds from the sale
of a portion of the  Company's  securities  portfolio and  internally  generated
funds.

In October 2000 ADESA  completed  the purchase of nine auction  facilities  from
Manheim for $251  million,  plus $3.5  million for land and  construction  costs
associated  with  two of the  auction  facilities  acquired.  The  nine  auction
facilities  include eight auctions Manheim acquired from ADT. The Company funded
this transaction with internally  generated funds and the temporary  issuance of
short-term  debt.  The  short-term  debt was  refinanced  in  October  2000 with
long-term debt (see Long-Term Debt below). ADESA owns or leases, and operates 57
auctions across North America.

In June 2000  Florida  Water  purchased  the  assets  of  Spruce  Creek for $5.5
million,  plus a commitment to pay fees for water connections through June 2005.
Spruce Creek serves 5,600 water and wastewater customers in three communities in
Marion County, Florida. The systems acquired are designed to accommodate a total
of 10,000 water and wastewater  customers.  The Company funded this  transaction
with internally generated funds.

LONG-TERM  DEBT.  In March 2000 ADESA issued $35 million of 8.10% Senior  Notes,
Series B, due March 30, 2010.  Proceeds were used to refinance  short-term  bank
indebtedness   incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  vehicle  auction  facilities
purchased in 1999 and for general corporate purposes.

In June 2000 ALLETE  refinanced $4.6 million of 6.875% Pollution Control Revenue
Refunding  Bonds,  Series 1991-A with $4.6 million of Adjustable  Rate Pollution
Control Revenue  Refunding Bonds Series 2000 due December 1, 2015. The new bonds
had an initial interest rate of 4.75%.

In June 2000 Heater issued an $8 million,  8.24%, note to CoBank,  ACB, due June
20, 2025. Proceeds were used to refinance short-term  indebtedness  incurred for
the 1999 acquisition of Mid South and capital improvements in 1999 and 2000.

In July 2000 the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to
Rule 415 under the  Securities  Act of 1933 for an  aggregate of $400 million of
first  mortgage  bonds and debt  securities.  The SEC declared the  registration
statement  effective on August 7, 2000. In October 2000 the Company  issued $250
million of Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds, due October 20, 2003. The Company
has the option to redeem these bonds on or after  October 20, 2001,  in whole or
in part from time to time, on any interest payment date prior to their maturity.
Proceeds were used to refinance  short-term debt incurred in connection with the
recent  acquisition of nine vehicle  auction  facilities  from Manheim.  The new
bonds had an initial  interest rate of 7.61%. The Company may sell the remaining
securities  registered  in July 2000 if warranted by market  conditions  and the
Company's capital  requirements.  Any offer and sale of the first mortgage bonds
and debt securities will be made only by means of a prospectus.

PREFERRED  STOCK.  In April 2000 the  Company  redeemed  all  100,000  shares of
Redeemable  Serial  Preferred  Stock A, $7.125  Series for an  aggregate  of $10
million.  In July 2000 the Company  redeemed  all 100,000  shares of  Redeemable
Serial Preferred Stock A, $6.70 Series for an aggregate of $10 million. Proceeds
from the sale of a portion of the Company's  securities  portfolio  were used to
fund these redemptions.

In August 2000 the Company  redeemed all 113,358 shares of 5% Preferred Stock at
$102.50 per share plus  accrued and unpaid  dividends  of $0.75 per share for an
aggregate of $11.7 million.  Internally  generated  funds were used to fund this
redemption.

LEASES.  In April  2000  leases  for three  ADESA  auction  facilities  (Boston,
Charlotte and  Knoxville)  were  refinanced in a $28.4 million  leveraged  lease
transaction. The new lease expires on April 1, 2010, but may be terminated after
2005 under certain  conditions.  ALLETE has guaranteed ADESA's obligations under
the lease.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures  for the nine months
ended  September  30,  2000  totaled  $94.0  million  ($68.6  million  in 1999).
Expenditures for 2000 included $34.9 million for Energy Services,  $40.3 million
for  Automotive  Services  and  $18.8  million  for Water  Services.  Internally
generated  funds and the issuance of long-term debt were the primary  sources of
funding for these expenditures.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 1998 the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  (SFAS) 133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities,"  as amended by SFAS 137,  effective  for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes  accounting and
reporting  standards  requiring that every derivative  instrument be recorded on
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair value.  SFAS
133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently
in  earnings  unless  specific  hedge  accounting   criteria  are  met.  Special
accounting  for  qualifying  hedges  allows a  derivative's  gains and losses to
offset the related results on the hedged item. The Company currently believes it
has only a limited amount of derivative activity and adoption of SFAS 133 is not
expected  to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial  position  and
results of operations.

Readers are cautioned that forward-looking  statements including those contained
above,  should be read in conjunction with the Company's  disclosures  under the
heading:  "SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES  LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995" located in the preface of this Form 10-Q.


ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's  securities portfolio has exposure to both price and interest rate
risk.  Investments held principally for near-term sale are classified as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
the common stock of publicly traded companies.  In strategies  designed to hedge
overall  market  risks,  the Company also sells common stock short.  Investments
held for an  indeterminate  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale
securities  and  also  recorded  at fair  value.  Available-for-sale  securities
consisted of securities in a grantor trust  established to fund certain employee
benefits. In May 2000 ALLETE sold its entire investment in ACE. (See Note 7.)

     Paragraphs

Overall,  the domestic steel industry continues to face price  deterioration and
high levels of imported products. Through August 2000 the United States imported
over 27  million  net tons of steel.  This level of imports is almost 17 percent
higher than the same period in 1999 and remains  almost 3 percent higher than in
1998, a crisis year for the  industry.  When  annualized,  this level of imports
equates to an estimated 41  million-ton  year,  just  slightly  less than 1998's
import  record of 41.5  million net tons.  The  average  value of all steel mill
product  imports has declined to about $70 per ton, or 15.4  percent,  below the
pre-crisis value in first quarter 1998.

Although  imports  remain high,  shipments  of steel from U.S.  steel mills have
stayed  moderately  strong.  In the first eight months of 2000, U.S. steel mills
shipped 75.6 million net tons, up 10.7 percent from the same period in 1999 when
68.3 million net tons were shipped.

On October 13, 2000 the Company  filed with the FERC, as required by Order 2000,
its  description  of efforts the Company has made to  participate  in a regional
transmission  organization  (RTO)  and an  explanation  of the  reasons  why the
Company  has not  filed an  application  with the FERC to  transfer  operational
control  of its  transmission  facilities  to an  approved  RTO.  The  Company's
explanation included concerns about financial uncertainties and participation by
other  regional  transmission  owners  including  those who are not regulated by
FERC.

In  April  2000   Mid-Continent   Area  Power   Pool   (MAPP)  and   Mid-America
Interconnected  Network (MAIN) approved a memorandum of  understanding  to merge
the reliability  functions of the two organizations  into a Midwest  Reliability
Organization  (MRO).  The new MRO will be designed and structured to comply with
North  American  Electric  Reliability  Council's  requirements   applicable  to
regional reliability  organizations (RRO). A combined, larger RRO is expected to
provide  cost  savings  and  improve  the  wholesale  energy  market by applying
consistent  rules  across a  broader  region.  Definitive  agreements  have been
completed and provided to the  membership of MAPP and MAIN.  Both  organizations
were scheduled to vote in October 2000 to decide whether or not to establish the
new  organization.  MAPP members  voted 92 percent in favor of the  combination.
MAIN members have  postponed  their vote until January 25, 2001, and the Company
is not able to predict the outcome of this vote.

                              GUARANTEE AGREEMENT

     GUARANTEE AGREEMENT (this  "Agreement"),  dated as of August 16, 2000, made
by and among Minnesota Power,  Inc., a Minnesota  corporation (the "Guarantor"),
CoBank,  ACB not in its  individual  capacity  but  solely  in its  capacity  as
Administrative  Agent under the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter  defined),  and
ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as the sole Minnesota Power Bank as of the date hereof.

                                    RECITALS

     Split Rock Energy LLC (the  "Company") has entered into a Credit  Agreement
dated as of the date hereof with CoBank,  ACB, as Administrative  Agent, and the
other  financial  institutions  from time to time  party  thereto  (the  "Credit
Agreement").

     As of the date  hereof,  the  Company  is 50% owned by the  Guarantor.  The
Guarantor acknowledges that it is in its best interests for the Company to enter
into the  Credit  Agreement  and  obtain the  credit  provided  thereunder.  The
Minnesota  Power  Banks (but not the GRE Banks)  have  required  as a  condition
precedent to their entering into the Credit  Agreement and extending credit from
time to time in accordance  with the terms thereof that the Guarantor enter into
this  Agreement  unconditionally  and  irrevocably  guarantying  all  Guaranteed
Obligations (as hereinafter defined) owing to the Minnesota Power Banks.

     The  Minnesota  Power Banks are willing to enter into the Credit  Agreement
and  extend  credit  from time to time in  accordance  with the  terms  thereof,
subject to and in reliance upon, among other things, the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

     NOW. THEREFORE,  in consideration of the foregoing,  and for other good and
valuable  consideration,  receipt and adequacy of which is hereby  acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

     Section 1.  RECITALS.   The  recitals  are  hereby  incorporated  by  this
reference.

     Section 2.  DEFINITIONS.  All  capitalized  terms  used in this  Agreement
without  definition  shall  have the  meanings  ascribed  to them in the  Credit
Agreement.

     Section 3.  INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE. Whenever any section or provision
of the Minnesota Power Credit Facility is incorporated herein by reference, such
section or provision shall for all purposes be deemed to be incorporated and set
forth herein in its entirety,  mutatis mutandis,  and the related defined terms,
cross-referenced sections,  schedules and exhibits of the Minnesota Power Credit
Facility referred to in any such incorporated section or provision shall also be
deemed to be incorporated herein by reference in accordance with this Section 3,
provided that any reference in any section or provision  incorporated  herein by
reference to (i) "Agent",  "Bank",  or "Required  Banks" shall be deemed to by a
reference  to the  Minnesota  Power  Banks under the Credit  Agreement,(ii)  the
"Company"  shall be deemed to by a reference to the  Guarantor,  and (iii) "Loan
Documents" shall also include this Agreement. The sections and

<PAGE>

provisions  of the  Minnesota  Power  Credit  Facility  incorporated  herein  by
reference  shall survive and be binding upon the Guarantor  notwithstanding  the
termination or expiration of the Minnesota  Power Credit Facility and no waiver,
amendment,  supplement  or other  modification  to the  Minnesota  Power  Credit
Facility  made  after the date of this  Agreement  shall  have any affect on the
sections and provisions  incorporated herein by reference unless consented to in
writing by each of the Minnesota  Power Banks.  To the extent that the Guarantor
is required to provide any notice,  certificate or other  information  hereunder
and such notice,  certificate  or other  information  is provided to each of the
Minnesota Power Banks pursuant to the Minnesota Power Credit Facility within the
time and in proper  form,  if any,  specified  herein for the  providing of such
information, than the Guarantor shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligation
hereunder to provide such notice, certificate or other information.

     Section 4.  GUARANTY. The Guarantor hereby absolutely,  unconditionally and
irrevocably  guarantees the full and prompt payment to the Minnesota Power Banks
(but not the GRE Banks) of any and all Obligations  owing to the Minnesota Power
Banks  (but not the GRE  Banks)  as and when due  (whether  by  acceleration  or
otherwise),  howsoever  evidenced,  arising  under  or  relating  to the  Credit
Documents, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, joint or several,
or joint and several and howsoever  owned,  held or acquired;  and the Guarantor
further agrees to pay all reasonable expenses, legal and/or otherwise (including
court  costs  and  reasonable   attorneys'   fees),  paid  or  incurred  by  the
Administrative Agent or the Minnesota Power Banks in endeavoring to collect such
Obligations,  or  any  part  thereof,  and in  enforcing  this  guaranty  in any
litigation,  bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or otherwise (collectively, the
"Guaranteed Obligations").

     Guarantor's guaranty is a continuing,  absolute and unconditional guaranty,
and  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  effect  until  written  notice  of its
discontinuance shall be actually received by the Administrative  Agent, and also
until any and all of the Guaranteed  Obligations created,  existing or committed
to before  receipt of such notice  shall be fully  paid.  The  liability  of the
Guarantor  hereunder  shall  in no way be  affected  or  impaired  by  (and  the
Administrative   Agent  or  and  Minnesota  Power  Banks  are  hereby  expressly
authorized  to make from time to time,  without  notice to anyone) any increase,
sale, pledge, surrender,  compromise,  settlement,  release, renewal, extension,
indulgence, alteration, substitution, exchange, change in, modification or other
disposition of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,  either express or implied, or
of any  contract or  contracts  evidencing  any  thereof,  or of any security or
Collateral  therefor.  The liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall also in no
way be affected or impaired by any acceptance by the Administrative Agent or any
Bank  of any  security  for  or  other  guarantors  upon  any of the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  or by  any  failure,  neglect  or  omission  on  the  part  of the
Administrative  Agent  or  any  Bank  to  realize  upon  or  protect  any of the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or  any  collateral  or  security  or  other  guaranty
therefor,  or to exercise any lien upon or right of appropriation of any moneys,
credits or property of the Company possessed by the Administrative  Agent and/or
the Banks  toward  the  liquidation  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or by any
application of payments or credits  thereon.  The  Administrative  Agent and the
Banks shall have the exclusive right to determine how, when and what application
of payments and credits, if any, shall be made on the Guaranteed Obligations, or
any part  thereof.  Notwithstanding  anything  in any  Credit  Documents  to the
contrary,  in order to hold the Guarantor  liable  hereunder,  there shall be no
obligation on

                                       2

<PAGE>

the part of the  Administrative  Agent or the Banks,  at any time, to resort for
payment to the Company or to any other guaranty (including the GRE Guaranty), or
to any other person or corporation, their properties or estate, or resort to any
collateral, security, property, Liens or other rights or remedies whatsoever and
the  Administrative  Agent and the Minnesota Power Banks (but not the GRE Banks)
shall have the right to enforce  this  guaranty  irrespective  of whether or not
other  proceedings or steps are pending seeking resort to or realization upon or
from any of the foregoing.

     All diligence in collection or  protection,  and all  presentment,  demand,
protest and/or notice, as to any and everyone, whether or not the Company or the
Guarantor or others,  of dishonor and of default and of  non-payment  and of the
creation and existence of any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations,  and of any
security and collateral therefor, and of the acceptance of this guaranty, and of
any and all extensions of credit and indulgence, are expressly waived.

     Until payment of all Guaranteed  Obligations has irrevocably been made, the
Guarantor hereby  irrevocably  waives any claim or other rights which it may now
or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment,
performance or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder,  including,
without  limitation,  any  right  of  subrogation,  reimbursement,  exoneration,
contribution,  indemnification,  or any  right to  participate  in any  claim or
remedy of the Administrative  Agent and the Banks against the Company whether or
not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract,  statute or
common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the
Company  directly or  indirectly,  in cash or other property or by set-off or in
any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights.

     In the  case of the  dissolution,  liquidation,  or  insolvency  (howsoever
evidenced)  of, or the  institution  of bankruptcy or  receivership  proceedings
against the Company or the Guarantor or an Event of Default  occurs,  all of the
Guaranteed  Obligations then existing shall, at the option of the Administrative
Agent  or the  Minnesota  Power  Banks  (or  automatically,  in the  event  of a
bankruptcy or receivership  proceeding),  immediately become due and accrued and
payable from the Guarantor.  All dividends or other  payments  received from the
Company, or on account of the Company from whatsoever source, shall be taken and
applied as payment in gross,  and this  guaranty  shall  apply to and secure any
ultimate balance that shall remain owing to the Minnesota Power Banks.

     The  Minnesota  Power  Banks  may  sell,  assign,  or  transfer  all of the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any part thereof, or grant participations  therein,
and in that event each and every immediate and successive assignee,  transferee,
or holder of or participant  in all or any part of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,
shall  be a  beneficiary  of  this  guaranty,  as  fully  as if  such  assignee,
transferee,  holder or participant were herein by name  specifically  given such
rights, powers and benefits.

     If any payment applied by the  Administrative  Agent or the Minnesota Power
Banks  to  the  Guaranteed  Obligations  is  thereafter  set  aside,  recovered,
rescinded  or  required  to be  returned  for  any  reason  (including,  without
limitation, the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the

                                       3

<PAGE>

Company or any other obligor),  the Guaranteed Obligations to which such payment
was applied shall for the purposes of this guaranty be deemed to have  continued
in existence,  notwithstanding  such  application,  and this  guaranty  shall be
enforceable  as to  such  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  as  fully  as if such
application had never been made.

         All payments to be made by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made in the
same currency and funds in which the  Guaranteed  Obligations of the Company are
payable at the head office of the Administrative  Agent at Denver,  Colorado (or
at such other place for the account of the  Administrative  Agent as it may from
time to time  specify to the  Guarantor)  in  immediately  available  and freely
transferable funds at the place of payment, all such payments to be paid without
setoff,  counterclaim or reduction and without deduction for, and free from, any
and all  present  or future  taxes,  levies,  imposts,  duties,  fees,  charges,
deductions,  withholding or liabilities with respect thereto or any restrictions
or  conditions  of any nature.  If the  Guarantor is required by law to make any
deduction or withholding on account of any tax or other withholding or deduction
from any sum payable by the Guarantor  hereunder,  the  Guarantor  shall pay any
such tax or other  withholding or deduction and shall pay such additional amount
necessary to ensure that,  after making any payment,  deduction or  withholding,
the Administrative  Agent and the Minnesota Power Banks shall receive and retain
(free of any liability in respect of any payment,  deduction or  withholding)  a
net sum equal to what it would have  received and so retained  hereunder  had no
such deduction, withholding or payment been required to have been made.

         The Guarantor waives any and all of its defenses, claims and discharges
and those of the Company,  or any other  obligor,  pertaining to the  Guaranteed
Obligations  or its  obligations  hereunder,  except the defense of discharge by
payment in full. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor
will not assert,  plead or enforce against the Administrative  Agent or any Bank
any defense of waiver, release, discharge in bankruptcy, statute of limitations,
res judicata,  statute of frauds,  anti-deficiency  statute, fraud,  incapacity,
minority,  usury,  illegality or unenforceability  which may be available to the
Company  or any  other  person  liable  in  respect  of  any  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  or any setoff available  against the  Administrative  Agent or any
Banks to the  Company or any such other  person,  whether or not on account of a
related transaction. The Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor shall be and remain
liable  for any  deficiency  remaining  after  foreclosure  of any  mortgage  or

Power  Banks and the  obligations  of the  Guarantor  hereunder,  if an Event of
Default occurs under the Credit Agreement and the  Administrative  Agent and the
Banks are prohibited or stayed by law from  accelerating or making demand on the
Guaranteed  Obligations  vis-a-vis the Company, the Administrative Agent and the
Minnesota Power Banks may, by written notice to the Guarantor,  declare the full
amount of the Guaranteed  Obligations to be immediately due and payable from the
Guarantor whether or not such Guaranteed  Obligations has been declared to be or
has become  immediately  due and payable from the Company and without  regard to
any constraints on or impediments to the ability of the Administrative Agent and
the  Minnesota  Power  Banks  to  accelerate  the  maturity  of such  Guaranteed
Obligations.

                 qualification necessary, except where the failure to so qualify
                 or be authorized  would not materially and adversely affect its
                 ability to perform its obligations hereunder, and (iii) has the
                 power to carry on its  business as now being  conducted  and as

                 insolvency,  reorganization or other similar laws affecting the
                 enforcement  of  creditors'  rights  generally and (ii) general
                 equitable  principles   regardless  of  whether  the  issue  of

                 or (iii)  results in the  creation of a condition or event that
                 constitutes  (or  that,  upon  notice or lapse of time or both,
                 would  constitute)  an event of default  under any  contractual
                 obligation of the Guarantor;

            (d)  No governmental approvals are required to authorize, or are
                 required  in  connection  with,  the  execution,  delivery  and
                 performance  of this  Agreement  or the taking of any action by
                 the Guarantor hereby contemplated;

            (e)  There are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity
                 now  pending  or,  to the  best of the  Guarantor's  knowledge,
                 threatened  against or  affecting  the  Guarantor or any of its
                 properties  or rights  which  could  materially  and  adversely

                 obligations  hereunder,  or which  question  or  challenge  the
                 validity of this  Agreement  or any action taken or to be taken
