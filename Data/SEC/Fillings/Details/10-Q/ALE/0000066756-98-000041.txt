                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on  behalf  of the  Company  in  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",
"expects",  "intends",  "plans",  "predicts",  "projects", "will likely result",
"will continue",  or similar expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and  may  be  forward-looking. 

Forward-looking  statements  involve  estimates, assumptions,  and uncertainties
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the
following important factors, which are difficult to predict, contain 
uncertainties, are beyond the control of the Company and may cause actual 
results  to  differ   materially   from  those   contained   in forward-looking
statements:
           - prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including
             those of the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC and the PSCW,  with
             respect to allowed  rates of return,  industry and rate  structure,
             acquisition  and disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation and
             construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased power and
             other capital investments, and present or prospective wholesale and
             retail  competition  (including but not limited to retail  wheeling
             and transmission costs);
           - economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
             risks;
           - changes in and compliance  with  environmental  and safety
             laws and policies;
           - weather conditions;
           - population growth rates and demographic patterns; 
           - competition for retail and wholesale customers; 
           - Year 2000 issues;
             - delays or changes in costs of Year 2000 compliance;  
             - failure of major suppliers, customers or others with whom the
               Company does  business to resolve their own Year 2000 issues on
               a timely basis;
           - pricing  and  transportation  of  commodities;  
           - market  demand, including  structural  market  changes;  
           - changes  in tax  rates or policies or in rates of inflation; 
           - changes in project  costs;  
           - unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital
             expenditures;
           - capital market conditions;
           - competition  for  new energy development opportunities; and
           - legal and administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or criminal)
             and settlements  that influence the business and  profitability  of
             the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

NOTE 2.    REGULATORY MATTERS

Florida Water 1991 Rate Case Refunds.  In 1995 the Florida First  District Court
of Appeals (Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform
rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With  "uniform  rates," all
customers in each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and  wastewater
services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
ordered  Florida Water to issue  refunds to those  customers who paid more since
October  1993 under  uniform  rates than they would have paid under  stand-alone
rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge to  customers  who paid
less under uniform rates. Florida Water appealed, and the Court of Appeals ruled
in June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without balancing surcharges.
In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC issued an order on January
26,  1998  that  did not  require  refunds.  Florida  Water's  potential  refund
liability at that time was about $12.5  million,  which  included  interest,  to
customers who paid more under uniform rates.

In the same January 26, 1998 order,  the FPSC  required  Florida Water to refund
$2.5 million,  the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service area from
January  1996 through June 1997 under  uniform  rates which  exceeded the amount
these customers would have paid under a modified stand-alone rate structure.  No
balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund because Spring
Hill customers continued to pay uniform rates after other customers began paying
modified stand-alone rates effective January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's interim
rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case (see "Florida Water 1995 Rate Case"
below).  The FPSC did not include Spring Hill in this interim rate order because
Hernando County had assumed  jurisdiction over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997
Florida Water reached an agreement with Hernando County to revert  prospectively
to stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups which paid more under  uniform  rates have  appealed the FPSC's
January 26, 1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund  because the
FPSC had no authority to order uniform rates.  The Company has appealed the $2.5
million refund order.  Initial briefs were filed by all parties on May 22, 1998.
Upon  issuance of the June 10, 1998 opinion of the Court of Appeals with respect
to  Florida  Water's  1995 Rate Case  (see  next  paragraph)  in which the court
reversed  its  previous  ruling  that the FPSC was  without  authority  to order
uniform rates,  other customer  groups  supporting the FPSC's January 1998 order
filed a motion  with the Court of  Appeals  seeking  dismissal  of the appeal by
customer groups seeking  refunds.  Customers  seeking refunds have filed amended
briefs on September  14, 1998. No provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The
Company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

Florida  Water 1995 Rate Case.  Florida  Water  requested an $18.1  million rate
increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers of Florida  Water
regulated by the FPSC. In October 1996 the FPSC issued its final order approving
an $11.1 million annual increase.  In November 1996 Florida Water filed with the
Court of Appeals an appeal of the FPSC's final order seeking  judicial review of
issues relating to the amount of investment in utility facilities recoverable in
rates from current customers. Other parties to the rate case also filed appeals.
In  the  course  of  the  appeals  process,  on  its  own  initiative  the  FPSC
reconsidered an issue in its initial decision and, in June 1997, allowed Florida
Water to resume collecting  approximately $1 million, on an annual basis, in new
customer  fees. On June 10, 1998 the Court of Appeals  ruled in Florida  Water's
favor on all material  issues  appealed by Florida Water and remanded the matter
back to the FPSC for action  consistent  with the  Court's  order.  The Court of
Appeals also overturned its decision in Florida Water's 1991 Rate Case which had
required a "functional  relationship" between service areas as a precondition to
implementation of uniform rates. The Court of Appeals denied a rehearing request
filed by  parties  opposed to the Court of  Appeals'  reversal  of its  previous
decision regarding uniform rates. The Company is unable to predict the timing or
outcome of these proceedings.

Hillsborough   County  Rates.   In  July  1997  Florida  Water  filed  with  the
Hillsborough County Utilities Department a request for an annual interim revenue
increase of $0.8 million and a final  increase of $0.9  million  from  customers
within  Hillsborough  County.  Interim  rates  became  effective in August 1997.
Hearings have concluded.  The Hillsborough Board of County  Commissioners (BOCC)
approved  100 percent of the  increases  requested  for two of the  Hillsborough
County  facilities  (approximately  $0.2  million).  With  respect  to the third
Hillsborough County facility, the BOCC voted on August 6, 1998 to

                                      -6-

NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

grant the  Company  the water rate  increase  requested  (additional  revenue of
approximately   $0.1  million),   but  denied  any   wastewater   rate  increase
(approximately  $0.6  million).  The BOCC also voted to require  the  Company to
refund interim wastewater rates to customers with interest.  The Company filed a
complaint and a request for review with the Circuit Court in Hillsborough County
on September 28, 1998. The Company is challenging the wastewater rate denial and
refund on several grounds,  including mistake of fact, violation of due process,
unlawful ex parte communications,  and other violations of the law. No provision
for refund has been  recorded.  The  Company is unable to predict the outcome of
this case.


NOTE 3.    TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

For the quarter ended  September 30, 1998 total  comprehensive  income was $25.0
million ($25.3 million for the quarter ended  September 30, 1997).  For the nine
months ended  September  30, 1998 total  comprehensive  income was $64.2 million
($60.7   million  for  the  nine  months  ended   September  30,  1997).   Total
comprehensive  income  includes  net  income,  unrealized  gains  and  losses on
securities  classified as  available-for-sale,  and foreign currency translation
adjustments.

NOTE 6.    SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

The Company has had a power  purchase  agreement  with Square  Butte since 1977.
Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation,  owns a 455 MW coal-fired
generating  unit (Unit) near  Center,  North  Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a
generating unit owned by Minnkota Power Cooperative,  Inc.  (Minnkota),  a North
Dakota cooperative  corporation whose Class A members are also members of Square
Butte.  Minnkota  serves as operator of the Unit and also  purchases  power from
Square Butte.

In May 1998 the  Company  and Square  Butte  entered  into a new power  purchase
agreement (1998 Agreement),  replacing the 1977 agreement.  The Company extended
by 20 years,  through  January 1, 2027,  its access to Square  Butte's  low-cost
electricity  and  eliminated its  unconditional  obligation to pay all of Square
Butte's  costs if not paid by Square  Butte  when due.  The 1998  Agreement  was
reached in conjunction  with  termination of Square Butte's  previous  leveraged
lease financing arrangement and refinancing of associated debt.

Similar  to  the  1977   agreement,   the  Company  is  initially   entitled  to
approximately  71 percent of the Unit's output under the 1998  Agreement.  After
2005 and upon compliance with a two-year  advance notice  requirement,  Minnkota
has the option to reduce the Company's  entitlement by 5 percent annually,  to a
minimum of 50 percent.

Under the 1998 Agreement,  the Company is obligated to pay its pro rata share of
Square Butte's costs based upon Unit output  entitlement.  The Company's payment
obligation  is  suspended  if Square  Butte fails to deliver any power,  whether
produced or purchased,  for a period of one year. The Company's obligation under
the 1977 agreement was absolute and  unconditional  whether or not any power was
delivered.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs consist  primarily of debt service.  At
September 30, 1998 Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $343.4  million.
Total annual debt service for Square Butte is expected to be  approximately  $36
million in 1999 through 2002 and $23 million in 2003.  Variable  operating costs
include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI Coal, a  subsidiary  of Minnesota
Power,  under a long-term  contract.  The Company's payments to Square Butte are
approved as purchased  power expenses for  ratemaking  purposes by both the MPUC
and FERC.


NOTE 7.    COMMON STOCK

On  September  24, 1998 the Company  issued and sold in an  underwritten  public
offering  2.0  million  shares of new  common  stock at  $43.75  per  share.  In
addition,  an  over-allotment  option for 93,000  shares at $43.75 per share was
exercised  by the  underwriters  on  October 9, 1998.  Total net  proceeds  were
approximately $89 million.

The  following  summarizes  significant  events that led to the 11.2 percent and
15.7 percent  increase in net income (8.2  percent and 12.4 percent  increase in
earnings  per share) for the quarter and nine months ended  September  30, 1998,
respectively.

   - Electric Operations.  Net income from Electric Operations reflected strong
     sales to other power  suppliers and marketers at higher  margins during the
     quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1998. The scheduled maintenance
     on generation  plants in the second quarter  positioned the Company to meet
     anticipated  strong  electric  demand  during the rest of 1998. In 1997 the
     Company recorded gains from the sale of certain land and other property.

   - Water  Services.  Net income  from Water  Services  was higher in 1998 due
     primarily  to  customer   growth,   increased   consumption  and  operating
     efficiencies. Increased sales of water resulting from drought conditions in
     Florida during the second and third quarters of 1998 helped to offset lower
     sales in the first quarter of 1998 because of record rainfall.

   - Automotive   Services.   The  significant  increase  in  net  income  from
     Automotive Services was driven by more vehicle sales, and the expansion and
     maturing  of  recently  opened  loan  production  offices in the  floorplan
     financing business.  The Company has added three new auction facilities and
     30 loan production offices in 1998.

   - Investments.  The  increase  in net income from  Investments  for the nine
     months  ended  September  30,  1998 was  attributable  to  dividend  income
     received  from a venture  capital  investment.  Net income from real estate
     operations  was lower in the third  quarter of 1998 because  several  large
     bulk land sales were recorded in the third quarter of 1997.

COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 AND 1997.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  Operating revenue and income from Electric Operations were
$6.9 million higher in 1998, even though  kilowatthour sales remained at similar
levels. This increase was primarily attributable to a higher average sales price
for bulk power sold to other power  suppliers  and  marketers,  and more revenue
from fuel clause and conservation  improvement  program  adjustments.  Bulk sale
prices were higher  partially  because of storms and hot weather in the Midwest.
Revenue related to the fuel clause  adjustment  increased in 1998 to provide for
the recovery of the cost of replacement power needed during scheduled outages at
Square  Butte  and  Boswell  in the  second  quarter  of 1998,  and also for the
reduction in hydro  generation due to dry winter and spring  conditions.  Demand
revenue from large power  customers  was lower in 1998 as a result of successful
renegotiation  of contracts  which extended the terms of the  contracts,  but in
turn reduced the demand charge  component.  Operating revenue and income in 1998
included $1.7 million more from recovery of lost margins  attributable  to sales
that  did  not  occur  due to  implementation  of  state  mandated  conservation
improvement  programs and in 1997 included a $0.9 million  pre-tax gain from the
sale of rights to microwave  frequencies in accordance  with a federal  mandate.
Total operating  expenses were $3.0 million higher in 1998 due to a $2.9 million
increase  in fuel and  purchased  power  expense.  Fuel  expense  was about $1.1
million  higher  because of more steam  generation  and purchased  power expense
increased $1.8 million because of higher prices in the market.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 30 percent of
electric  operating  revenue and income in 1998 (29  percent in 1997).  Electric
sales to paper and pulp mills  accounted  for 11 percent of  electric  operating
revenue  and income in both 1998 and 1997.  Sales to other power  suppliers  and
marketers  accounted for 18 percent of electric  operating revenue and income in
1998 and 15 percent in 1997.

WATER  SERVICES.  Operating  revenue  and income from Water  Services  were $2.3
million  higher  in 1998 due to  increased  water  sales and more  revenue  from
non-regulated water subsidiaries.  Consumption, which was up 25 percent in 1998,
reflected a September 1997  acquisition of a water utility in North Carolina and
drought conditions in Florida. Total operating expenses were $1.9 million higher
in 1998 due to additional costs related to the expansion of non-regulated  water
subsidiaries.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  Operating revenue and income from Automotive Services were
$18.5 million higher in 1998 due to a 14 percent  increase in vehicle sales, and
the  expansion  and maturing of AFC's  floorplan  financing  business.  At ADESA
auction  facilities  232,000 vehicles were sold in 1998 (203,000 in 1997). ADESA
had 28 auction  facilities at September 30, 1998 (24 at September 30, 1997). AFC
had 84 loan production offices at September 30, 1998 (54 at September 30, 1997).
Total operating  expenses were up $14.5 million due to expenses  associated with
increased vehicle sales and the expansion of the floorplan financing business.

INVESTMENTS.

   - SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE.  Operating  revenue and income were
     $0.4 million  higher in 1998 due to improved  performance by the securities
     portfolio.  Income from equity  investments  included  $3.9 million in 1998
     ($3.3  million  in 1997)  from the  Company's  investment  in  Capital  Re.
     Together,  the Company's  securities portfolio and its equity investment in
     Capital Re earned an  annualized  after-tax  return of 7.7  percent in 1998
     (7.1 percent in 1997).

   - REAL  ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Operating  revenue  and income from Real Estate
     Operations  were $8.1 million  lower in 1998 because in 1997 several  large
     bulk land sales were recorded. Total operating expenses (excluding minority
     interest)  were $2.5 million  lower in 1998  because more selling  expenses
     were incurred in 1997.

COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 AND 1997.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  Operating revenue and income from Electric Operations were
$20.6 million higher in 1998, even though kilowatthour sales remained at similar
levels. This increase primarily was attributable to a higher average sales price
for bulk power sold to other power  suppliers  and  marketers,  and more revenue
from fuel clause and conservation  improvement  program  adjustments.  Bulk sale
prices were higher  partially  because of storms and hot weather in the Midwest.
Revenue related to the fuel clause  adjustment  increased in 1998 to provide for
the recovery of the cost of replacement power needed during scheduled outages at
Square  Butte  and  Boswell  in the  second  quarter  of 1998,  and also for the
reduction in hydro  generation due to dry winter and spring  conditions.  Demand
revenue from large power  customers  was lower in 1998 as a result of successful
renegotiation  of contracts  which  extended  the term,  but in turn reduced the
demand charge component. Revenue from residential and gas customers was lower in
1998 because of the unusually mild winter and warm spring. Operating revenue and
income in 1997 included $4.3 million in pre-tax gains from the sale of rights to
microwave  frequencies  in  accordance  with a federal  mandate  and the sale of
property  along the St.  Louis River to ensure the  preservation  of  wilderness
lands. Total operating expenses were $21.2 million higher in 1998 due to a $16.4
million increase in fuel and purchased power expense and a $4.2 million increase
in operations  expense.  Fuel expense was about $2.9 million  higher  because of
more steam  generation.  Purchased power expense increased $13.5 million because
of higher prices in the market,  more sales to other power  suppliers,  and less
hydro  generation.  Operations  expense in 1998  reflected  increased  costs for
scheduled  outages at  Boswell,  consulting  services  and the  amortization  of
deferred charges related to conservation improvement programs.  Expenses in 1998
also reflected a reduction in employee  pension and early  retirement  expenses,
and less property taxes due to the reform of the Minnesota property tax system.

Revenue from electric  sales to taconite  customers  accounted for 31 percent of
electric  operating revenue and income in both 1998 and 1997.  Electric sales to
paper and pulp mills accounted for 11 percent of electric  operating revenue and
income  in 1998  (12  percent  in  1997).  Sales to other  power  suppliers  and
marketers  accounted for 16 percent of electric  operating revenue and income in
1998 (12 percent in 1997).

WATER  SERVICES.  Operating  revenue  and income from Water  Services  were $5.0
million  higher  in 1998 due to  increased  water  sales and more  revenue  from
non-regulated water subsidiaries.  Consumption, which was up 11 percent in 1998,
reflected a September  1997  acquisition  of a water utility in North  Carolina.
Increased sales of water resulting from drought conditions in Florida during the
second and third  quarters  of 1998  helped to offset  lower  sales in the first
quarter of 1998 because of record rainfall.  Total operating  expenses were $3.0
million  higher in 1998 because of additional  costs related to the expansion of
non-regulated water subsidiaries.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  Operating revenue and income from Automotive Services were
$55.1 million higher in 1998 due to a 15 percent  increase in vehicle sales, and
the  expansion  and maturing of AFC's  floorplan  financing  business.  At ADESA
auction  facilities  682,000 vehicles were sold in 1998 (594,000 in 1997). ADESA
had 28 auction  facilities at September 30, 1998 (24 at September 30, 1997). AFC
had 84 loan production offices at September 30, 1998 (54 at September 30, 1997).
In 1997 operating revenue and income included a gain from the sale of an auction
facility.  Total  operating  expenses  were up  $39.7  million  due to  expenses
associated  with  increased  vehicle  sales and the  expansion of the  floorplan
financing  business.  Income tax expense was $6.4 million higher in 1998 because
of increased operating income.

INVESTMENTS.

   - SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE.  Operating  revenue and income were
     $4.4 million higher in 1998 due to $3.9 million of dividend income received
     from a venture capital investment.  Income from equity investments included
     $11.9 million in 1998 ($10.6 million in 1997) from the Company's investment
     in Capital Re. Together,  the Company's securities portfolio and its equity
     investment  in  Capital  Re earned an  annualized  after-tax  return of 7.4
     percent in 1998 (8.1 percent in 1997).  Income tax expense was $3.1 million
     higher in 1998 because of increased operating income.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

   - REAL  ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Operating  revenue  and income from Real Estate
     Operations  were $1.7  million  lower in 1998  because  in  September  1997
     several large bulk land sales were recorded.  Operating  revenue and income
     in 1998  reflected  four  large  sales  at  Palm  Coast  and the  sale of a
     partnership interest in a development at Lehigh.  Combined,  the five sales
     contributed  $11.5  million to revenue in 1998.  Total  operating  expenses
     (excluding minority interest) were $1.7 million lower in 1998.


LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES.  Cash flow from operations improved during the nine months
ended September 30, 1998 due to the continued focus on the management of working
capital throughout the Company. Cash from operating activities was also affected
by a number of factors representative of normal operations.

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 4 million  original issue shares of Common Stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers.  However,  ADESA utilizes proceeds from the
sale of  commercial  paper  issued by the  Company  to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC also uses proceeds  from the sale of commercial  paper issued by the Company
to meet its operational  requirements.  AFC offers short-term  on-site financing
for dealers to purchase vehicles at auctions in exchange for a security interest
in those vehicles. The financing is provided through the earlier of the date the
dealer  sells  the  vehicle  or a  general  borrowing  term of 30 - 45 days.  At
September 30, 1998 AFC had sold $149.0 million  ($124.0  million at December 31,
1997) of receivables on a revolving basis to a third party  purchaser.  Under an
agreement,  the purchaser agrees to purchase up to $225.0 million of receivables
on a revolving  basis.  Proceeds  from the sale of the  receivables  are used to
repay borrowings from the Company and fund vehicle inventory purchases for AFC's
customers.

Significant changes in accounts  receivable,  accounts payable and notes payable
balances  at  September  30,  1998  compared  to  December  31, 1997 were due to
increased sales activity by Automotive  Services.  Typically auction volumes are
down during the winter  months and in  December  because of the  holidays.  As a
result, both ADESA and AFC had lower receivables and fewer payables at year end.

Effective  May 8,  1998  AFC  executed  an  Administration  Agreement  with  ADT
Automotive,  Inc. (ADT) which has led to an arrangement whereby AFC is providing
floorplan financing services at 26 ADT auctions.

In May 1998 the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of
1933 with  respect to 3.0 million  original  issue  shares of Common  Stock.  On
September  24,  1998  the  Company  issued  and sold in an  underwritten  public
offering  2.0  million  of these  shares at $43.75 per share.  In  addition,  an
over-allotment option for 93,000 shares at $43.75 per share was exercised by the
underwriters on October 9, 1998. Total net proceeds of approximately $89 million
will be used to repay outstanding commercial paper, to fund acquisitions and for
other general corporate purposes,  including capital expenditures.  Net proceeds
not  immediately  used for the above  purposes will be invested in the Company's
securities  portfolio.  The Company may sell the remaining shares  registered in
May  1998  if  warranted  by  market   conditions  and  the  Company's   capital
requirements. The offer and sale of such shares shall be made only by means of a
prospectus.  The increase in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as
of  September  30, 1998 had an  immaterial  impact on earnings per share for the
1998 periods.

                                      -12-

ADESA acquired the assets of Greater  Lansing Auto Auction in Lansing,  Michigan
and I-55 Auto Auction in St. Louis,  Missouri on April 30, 1998,  and Ark-La-Tex
Auto Auction in  Shreveport,  Louisiana on May 27, 1998 for a combined  purchase
price of $23.8 million.  The Company used internally  generated funds and issued
commercial paper to acquire these assets.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated  capital  expenditures  for the nine months
ended  September  30,  1998  totaled  $51.3  million  ($47.7  million  in 1997).
Expenditures  for 1998  included  $24.6 million for Electric  Operations,  $10.4
million for Water Services and $16.3 million for Automotive Services. Internally
generated  funds were the primary source for funding these  expenditures.  Total
capital expenditures are expected to be $90 million for 1998.

YEAR 2000.  The Year 2000 issue relates to computer  systems that  recognize the
year in a date field using only the last two digits. Unless corrected,  the Year
2000 may be interpreted as 1900, causing errors or shutdowns in computer systems
which may, in turn, disrupt operations.

State of Readiness. The Company has been addressing the Year 2000 issue for five
years. In the ordinary course of business, it has replaced, or is in the process
of replacing, many of its major computer systems with new systems that have been
designed  to be Year 2000  compliant.  These  updated  systems  handle  critical
aspects of the Company's operations,  including energy management and generation
control  for  Electric  Operations,   and  customer  information  and  financial
management Company-wide.

Each of the  business  segments  has its own  Year  2000  plan,  which  has been
reviewed and is being monitored by a  corporate-level  Year 2000 Risk Assessment
Team.  The  Company's  plan  for  Year  2000  readiness  involves  four  phases:
inventory,  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency  planning.  Testing is an
ongoing  and  integral  part  of the  evaluation,  remediation  and  contingency
planning phases.

  - Inventory.  Each business  segment has performed an extensive  inventory of
    its  information  technology  systems and other  systems  that use  embedded
    microprocessors (collectively,  "Systems"). The business processes supported
    by each System have been prioritized  based on the degree of impact business
    operations would encounter if the System were disrupted.

    The inventory  phase also includes  identifying  third parties with whom the
    Company  has  material  relationships.  The  degree to which  each  business
    segment  depends on third party support varies.  Water Services,  Automotive
    Services and Real Estate  Operations  have  identified  minimal risk in most
    areas.  Where a third party is critical  to a business  process,  efforts to
    obtain  Year 2000  compliance  information  to  identify  the degree of risk
    exposure the business may encounter have been initiated. Electric Operations
    is working with its large power customers to share Year 2000 information and
    determine their readiness. In addition,  Electric Operations is working with
    its fuel and  transportation  providers  in an  effort  to  ensure  adequate
    supplies of fuel.

    The  electric  industry is unique in its  reliance on the  integrity  of the
    power pool grid to support  and  maintain  reliable,  efficient  operations.
    Preparation  for the Year 2000 by Electric  Operations is linked to the Year
    2000 compliance  efforts of other utilities as well as to those of its major
    customers whose loads support the integrity of the power pool grid. Electric
    Operations is coordinating its Year 2000 efforts with the plans  established
    by the North American  Electric  Reliability  Council under the direction of
    the U.S.  Department of Energy and is also working with the MAPP Year 2000
    Task Force and  a  utility industry consortium  to   obtain   and  share
    utility-specific Year 2000 compliance information.

    The  internal  inventory  phase was  substantially  completed  in June 1998.
    Regular  contact  with third  parties  with whom the  Company  has  material
    relationships will continue throughout 1999.

  - Evaluation.  This phase involves  computer program code review and testing,
    vendor contacts,  System testing, and fully-integrated  System testing where
    practical.  The  objective  of this  phase  is to  develop  and  update  the
    remediation  plan.  Some  Systems,  upon  inspection,  are  determined to be
    non-compliant and are immediately placed on the remediation  schedule.  Some
    Systems require testing to determine compliance status. The evaluation phase
    is expected to be  substantially  completed  by June 30,  1999.  The Company
    estimates that as of November 6, 1998 the evaluation phase is approximately
    45 percent complete.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

  - Remediation.  In this  phase  each  System is  either  fixed,  replaced  or
    removed.  Critical  Systems  fixed or replaced will be tested again for Year
    2000  compliance.  Remediation is expected to be  substantially  complete by
    June  30,  1999.  The  Company  estimates  that as of November 6, 1998 the
    remediation  phase is approximately 15 percent complete.

  - Contingency  Planning.   Each  business  segment  is  currently  developing
    contingency plans designed to continue  critical  processes in the event the
    Company  experiences Year 2000 disruptions  despite remediation and testing.
    Plans under development include  establishment of internal  communications
    and securing  adequate  onsite supplies of critical  materials.  Contingency
    plans also will be tested. Contingency plans are expected to be developed by
    June 30, 1999.

Costs. In the ordinary course of business over the last five years,  the Company
has replaced major business and operating computer systems. These systems should
require  minimal  remediation  efforts  because of their recent  implementation.
Formal Year 2000  readiness  plans were  established  in March 1998.  Since that
time, the Company has incurred  approximately $0.6 million in expenses primarily
for labor  associated with inventory,  evaluation and remediation  efforts.  The
Company  estimates  its cost to prepare  for the Year 2000 will be $6 million to
$10 million  over the next two years,  the majority of which will be incurred in
1999.  Funds to address Year 2000 issues have been provided for in the Company's
existing  budgets.  Most of these costs will be incurred for existing  personnel
assigned to Year 2000 projects or capitalized. To date no critical projects have
been deferred because of Year 2000 issues.  The Company does not anticipate that
its costs  associated  with Year  2000  readiness  will  materially  impact  the
Company's earnings in any year.

Risks.  Based upon  information to date, the Company  believes that, in the most
reasonably likely worst-case scenario, Year 2000 issues could result in abnormal
operating   conditions,   such  as  short-term   interruption   of   generation,
transmission and distribution  functions within Electric Operations,  as well as
Company-wide loss of system monitoring and control functions,  and loss of voice
communications.  These  conditions,  along with power  outages  due to  possible
instability  of  the  regional  electric  transmission  grid,  could  result  in
temporary interruption of service to customers. The Company does not believe the
overall  impact of this  scenario  will have a material  impact on its financial
condition or operations.

ACT OF 1995" located in the preface of this Form 10-Q.


NEW ACCOUNTING  STANDARD.  In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133), effective for fiscal
years  beginning  after  June 15,  1999.  SFAS 133  establishes  accounting  and
reporting  standards  requiring that every derivative  instrument be recorded on
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at fair value.  SFAS
133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently
in  earnings  unless  specific  hedge  accounting   criteria  are  met.  Special
accounting  for  qualifying  hedges  allows a  derivative's  gains and losses to
offset the related  results on the hedged item. SFAS 133 is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company upon adoption.

ITEM 5.    OTHER INFORMATION

Reference is made to the Company's 1997 Form 10-K for background  information on
the following updates.  Unless otherwise indicated,  cited references are to the
Company's 1997 Form 10-K.


Ref. Page 2. - Electric Sales - Last Partial Paragraph

The record level of steel imports into the United States is adversely  affecting
the domestic  steel  industry.  If the trend  continues,  lower demand for steel
produced in the United States will likely have an adverse effect on the taconite
producers and the economy as a whole in northern  Minnesota.  Representatives of
the United  States steel  industry have asserted that the imports are unfair and
illegal,  and have filed  anti-dumping  trade suits with the U.S.  Department of
Commerce.  The Company is unable to predict the eventual impact of this issue on
the Company's Electric Operations.


Ref. Page 3. - Large Power Customer Contracts - Last Paragraph
Ref. Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1998, Page 15. - First Paragraph

As of November  1, 1998 the minimum  annual  revenue the Company  would  collect
under  contracts with these large power  customers,  assuming no electric energy
use by these customers, is estimated to be $109.2, $85.0, $71.2, $67.8 and $57.4
million during the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Based on
past experiences and projected  operating  levels,  the Company believes revenue
from these large power customers will be  substantially in excess of the minimum
contract amounts.

Six of the seven  taconite  producers in Minnesota  have  collective  bargaining
agreements with the United Steel Workers of America.  These agreements expire in
August 1999. The Company is unable to predict  whether or not any labor disputes
will arise in the course of union  negotiations and, if such disputes occur, the
impact thereof on the Company's Electric Operations.

Hillsborough County Rates

In July  1997  Florida  Water  filed  with  the  Hillsborough  County  Utilities
Department a request for an annual interim revenue  increase of $0.8 million and
a final  increase of $0.9 million from  customers  within  Hillsborough  County.
Interim  rates became  effective in August 1997.  Hearings have  concluded.  The
Hillsborough  Board of County  Commissioners  (BOCC) approved 100 percent of the
increases requested for two of the Hillsborough County facilities (approximately
$0.2 million).  With respect to the third Hillsborough County facility, the BOCC
voted on August 6, 1998 to grant the Company the water rate  increase  requested
(additional  revenue of approximately  $0.1 million),  but denied any wastewater
rate increase  (approximately $0.6 million).  The BOCC also voted to require the
Company to refund  interim  wastewater  rates to customers  with  interest.  The
Company  filed a complaint  and a request  for review with the Circuit  Court in
Hillsborough  County on  September  28,  1998.  The Company is  challenging  the
wastewater rate denial and refund on several grounds, including mistake of fact,
violation of due process, unlawful ex parte communications, and other violations
of the law. No provision for refund has been recorded.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this case.

 As Representatives of the several Underwriters
c/o PaineWebber Incorporated
1285 Avenue of the Americas
New York, New York 10019

Dear Sirs:

         Minnesota Power, Inc. (the "Company") proposes to issue and sell to you
and to the other  underwriters  named in Schedule 1 hereto (each an "Underwriter
and,   collectively,   the   "Underwriters"),   for  whom  you  are   acting  as
representatives (the "Representatives"), an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of the
Company's  Common  Stock,  without  par  value  (the  "Common  Stock"),  and the
preferred share purchase rights  attached  thereto (the "Rights")  (collectively
referred  to as "Firm  Shares").  The  Company  has also  agreed to grant to the
Underwriters  an option (the  "Option") to purchase up to an additional  300,000
shares of Common Stock and the attached Rights (collectively  referred to as the
"Option  Shares") on the terms and for the purposes  set forth in Section  1(b).
The Firm  Shares  and the  Option  Shares are  collectively  referred  to as the
"Shares."

         The  initial  public  offering  price per share for the  Shares and the
purchase  price per share for the Shares to be paid by the several  Underwriters
shall be agreed upon by the Company and the Representatives, acting on behalf of
the several  Underwriters,  and such agreement  shall be set forth in a separate
written  instrument  substantially  in the form of Annex A  hereto  (the  "Price
Determination  Agreement").  The Price Determination Agreement may take the form
of an  exchange  of any  standard  form of written  telecommunication  among the
Company and the Representatives and shall specify such applicable information as
is indicated in Annex A hereto.  The offering of the Shares shall be governed by
this Agreement, as supplemented by the Price Determination  Agreement.  From and
after  the  date  of the  execution  and  delivery  of the  Price  Determination
Agreement,  this  Agreement  shall be deemed to  incorporate,  and,  unless  the
context otherwise indicates, all references 


<PAGE>

contained herein to "this Agreement" and the  phrase  "herein"  shall be deemed 
to  include  the Price  Determination Agreement.

         The Company confirms as follows its agreements with the Representatives
and the several other Underwriters.


         1. Agreement to Sell and Purchase.

            (a) The Company agrees to issue and sell to each Underwriter, and 
each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company
at the  purchase  price per share for the Firm  Shares to be agreed  upon by the
Representatives  and  the  Company  and set  forth  in the  Price  Determination
Agreement,  the  number  of Firm  Shares  set  forth  opposite  the name of such
Underwriter in Schedule 1 thereto,  plus such  additional  number of Firm Shares
such Underwriter may become obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 10 hereof.
The  obligations  of the  Underwriters  under this Agreement are several and not
joint. The obligations of the Company and the Underwriters  under this Agreement
are  undertaken  on the  basis of the  representations  and are  subject  to the
conditions of this Agreement.

            (b)  Subject  to  all  the  terms  and conditions in this Agreement,
the Company grants the Option to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, to
purchase  up to 300,000  Option  Shares  from the  Company at the same price per
share as the  Underwriters  shall pay for the Firm  Shares.  The  Option  may be
exercised  only to cover  over-allotments  in the sale of the Firm Shares by the
several  Underwriters  and may be exercised in whole or in part at any time (but
not more than once),  upon  written or  telegraphic  notice (the  "Option  Share
Notice") by the  Representatives  to the Company on or before the 30th day after
the date of this Agreement  setting forth the aggregate  number of Option Shares
to be purchased  and the time and date for such  purchase  (the "Option  Closing
Date"),  which  Option  Closing  Date  may be the same as the  Closing  Date (as
defined in Section 2) but in no event shall the Option  Closing  Date be earlier
than the Closing Date nor later than five  business days after the giving of the
Option Shares  Notice.  On the Option  Closing Date, the Company shall issue and
sell to the several  Underwriters  the number of Option  Shares set forth in the
Option Shares Notice, and each Underwriter shall purchase such percentage of the
Option Shares as is equal to the percentage of Firm Shares that such Underwriter
is purchasing,  as adjusted by the  Representatives  in such manner as they deem
advisable to avoid fractional shares.

            (c) The initial public offering price per share for the Firm Shares 
and the  purchase  price per share for the Firm Shares to be paid by the several
Underwriters  shall be  agreed  upon and set  forth in the  Price  Determination
Agreement, which shall be dated the date hereof.

         2. Payment and Delivery.  Delivery of the Firm Shares shall be made to
the Representatives in New York, New York, against payment of the purchase price
by wire  transfer of  immediately  available  funds to an account  designated in
writing by the Company to the  Underwriters  at least one  business day prior to
the Closing Date (as hereinafter  defined).  Such payment shall be made at 10:00
a.m.,  New York City time,  on September  30, 1998 or at such time on such other
date 

                                       2
<PAGE>

as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Representatives  (such date is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date").

         To the extent  that the Option is  exercised,  delivery of the Option 
Shares against payment by the Underwriters (in the manner specified above) shall
take place in the manner  specified  above for the Closing  Date at the time and
date (which may be the Closing Date) specified in the Option Shares Notice.

         3. Registration Statement and Prospectus; Public Offering. The Company
has  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission (the "Commission"),
pursuant  to  provisions  of the  Securities  Act of 1933  (the  "Act")  and the
published rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder (the "Rules
and  Regulations"),  a  registration  statement  (No.  333-52161)  on Form  S-3,
relating to the  registration of 3,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock,
without par value. Such registration statement was declared effective on May 18,
1998. The term  "preliminary  prospectus"  as used herein means any  preliminary
prospectus as contemplated by Rule 430 of the Rules and Regulations  included at
any time as a part of such registration  statement.  Copies of such registration
statement and any amendments thereto and of each preliminary prospectus included
as  part  of  such   registration   statement   have  been   delivered   to  the
Representatives.  Such registration  statement, as it may be amended to the date
of this  Agreement,  including  financial  statements and all exhibits,  and the
prospectus,  as supplemented by a final  prospectus  supplement  relating to the
Shares proposed to be filed electronically  pursuant to Rule 424 are hereinafter
respectively  referred to as the "Registration  Statement" and the "Prospectus."
Any reference herein to the Registration Statement,  any preliminary prospectus,
preliminary  prospectus supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to
and include the documents  incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12
of Form S-3 of the Act (the "Incorporated Documents") which were filed under the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act"), on or before
the Effective Date or the date of such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus,
as the case may be. Any reference  herein to the terms  "amend,"  "amendment" or
"supplement"  with  respect  to  the  Registration  Statement,  any  preliminary
prospectus or the Prospectus  shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing
of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective  Date, or the date of
any  preliminary  prospectus  or  the  Prospectus,  as  the  case  may  be,  and
incorporated  in such  document by reference if such filing is made prior to the
Closing Date. Any reference  herein to the term "Effective Date" shall be deemed
to refer to the  later of the  time  and  date the  Registration  Statement  was
declared  effective  or the time and date of the  filing of the  Company's  most
recent  Annual  Report on Form 10-K if such  filing is made prior to the Closing
Date.

         The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public
offering of the Firm Shares,  as described in the  Prospectus, as soon after the
date of the Price  Determination  Agreement as the Underwriters  deem advisable.
The Company  confirms that the  Underwriters and dealers have been authorized to
distribute  each  preliminary  prospectus,  if any, and  preliminary  prospectus
supplement and are authorized to distribute the Prospectus and any amendments or
supplements to it.

         4. Representations of the Company.  The Company represents to the 
Underwriters as follows:

            (a)  The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under
the Act.

Registration Statement and, at the date of the filing of the Prospectus,  and at
the Closing Date,  and, if later,  the Option Closing Date, the  Prospectus,  as
each may be amended or supplemented,  fully complied or will fully comply in all
material  respects with the  applicable  provisions of the Act and the Rules and
Regulations,  or pursuant to the Rules and Regulations shall be deemed to comply
therewith.  On the  Effective  Date and Closing  Date and, if later,  the Option
Closing Date, the Registration  Statement, as it may be amended or supplemented,
did not and will not contain an untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit to
state a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary to make the
statements  therein not misleading.  On the date of filing of the Prospectus and
the Closing Date, and, if later, the Option Closing Date, the Prospectus,  as it
may be amended  or  supplemented,  will not  contain  an untrue  statement  of a
material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  necessary in order to make the
statements  therein,  in the light of the  circumstances  under  which they were
made,  not  misleading.  On the date of filing of the Prospectus and the Closing
Date, and, if later, the Option Closing Date, the Incorporated  Documents did or
will fully comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission  under the Exchange
Act (the "Exchange Act Rules and Regulations"), and, when read together with the
Prospectus,  as it may be amended or  supplemented,  will not  contain an untrue
statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading.  The
foregoing  representations  do not  apply to  statements  or  omissions  made in
reliance on and in  conformity  with  information  relating  to any  Underwriter
furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives  expressly for use in
the  Registration  Statement  or the  Prospectus,  as  they  may be  amended  or
supplemented.  For all  purposes of this  Agreement,  the amounts of the selling
concession  and  reallowance  set  forth in the  Prospectus  and the  statements
contained   in  the  first   paragraph   on  page  S-2  and  under  the  caption
"Underwriting"  on page S-5 of any  preliminary  prospectus  supplement  and the
Prospectus  regarding  stabilization and other transactions  constitute the only
information  relating to any Underwriter  furnished in writing to the Company by
the  Representatives  specifically for inclusion in any preliminary  prospectus,
any  preliminary  prospectus  supplement,  the  Registration  Statement  or  the
Prospectus.

            (c)  The Company and its  Material  Subsidiaries  (as defined below)
have  good  and  sufficient  title to all real  material  property  and good and
sufficient title to all material  personal  property owned by them, in each case
free  and  clear of all  liens,  encumbrances  and  defects  except  such as are
described in the Prospectus or such as do not materially  interfere with the use
made and  proposed to be made of such  property by the Company and its  Material
Subsidiaries;  and any material real property and buildings  held under lease by
the  Company  and its  Material  Subsidiaries  are  held by  them  under  valid,
subsisting and  enforceable  leases with such exceptions as are not material and
do not materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of

                                       4
<PAGE>

such  property and  buildings by the Company and its Material  Subsidiaries  (as
used in this  Agreement,  the term  "Material  Subsidiary"  means a  significant
subsidiary under Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X of the Commission).

            (d)  The  Company  has been duly incorporated  and is validly 
existing as a  corporation  in good standing  under the laws of Minnesota,  with
power and authority  (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its
business as described in the Prospectus,  and there is no  jurisdiction  wherein
the character of the properties  owned or held under lease by the Company or the
nature of the business transacted by the Company would expose the Company to any
material liability or disability by reason of the failure to qualify the Company
as a foreign corporation in any such jurisdiction;  and each Material Subsidiary
of the  Company  has  been  duly  incorporated  and  is  validly  existing  as a
corporation   in  good  standing   under  the  laws  of  its   jurisdiction   of
incorporation,  and  there  is no  jurisdiction  wherein  the  character  of the
properties owned or held under lease by any Material Subsidiary or the nature of
the business  transacted by such Material  Subsidiary would expose such Material
Subsidiary  to any material  liability or disability by reason of the failure to
qualify  such  Material   Subsidiary  as  a  foreign  corporation  in  any  such
jurisdiction.

            (e)  Since  the  respective  dates  as of which information is given
in the  Registration  Statement  and the  Prospectus,  as they may be amended or
supplemented, there has not been any material adverse change, or any development
involving,  so far as the  Company can now  reasonably  foresee,  a  prospective
material  adverse change,  in the management,  business,  properties,  financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries  taken as
a whole,  and there has not been any transaction  entered into by the Company or
its Material  Subsidiaries,  other than  transactions  in the ordinary course of
business  and  transactions  set forth in or  contemplated  by the  Registration
Statement and the Prospectus,  as they may be amended or supplemented,  which is
material to the Company and its subsidiaries,  taken as a whole. The Company and
its Material  Subsidiaries have no contingent  obligation which is not disclosed
in the  Registration  Statement  and the  Prospectus,  as they may be amended or
supplemented,  which is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

            (f)  Any  Incorporated Documents filed and incorporated by reference
prior to the Closing Date will, when they are filed with the Commission, conform
in all  material  respects  with the  requirements  of the  Exchange Act and the
Exchange Act Rules and Regulations.

            (g)  The  Company  has full  corporate  power and authority to enter
into this  Agreement.  This  Agreement  has been duly  authorized,  executed and
delivered  by the Company and is a valid and  binding  agreement  of the Company
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

            (h)  The performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the 
transactions  contemplated  hereby and the  application of the net proceeds from
the  offering and sale of the Shares to be sold by the Company in the manner set
forth in the Prospectus  under "Use of Proceeds" will not result in the creation
or imposition of any lien,  charge or encumbrance  upon any of the assets of the
Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms or provisions

                                       5
<PAGE>

of, or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions  of, or
constitute a default under,  or give any other party a right to terminate any of
its obligations  under, or result in the  acceleration of any obligation  under,
the  certificate  of  incorporation  or  by-laws  of the  Company  or any of its
Material  Subsidiaries,  any material  contract or other  agreement to which the
Company or any of its Material  Subsidiaries  is a party or by which the Company
or any of its  Material  Subsidiaries  or any  of its  properties  is  bound  or
affected,  or violate or  conflict in any  material  respect  with any  material
judgment,  ruling,  decree,  order,  statute, rule or regulation of any court or
other  governmental  agency or body  applicable to the business or properties of
the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries.

            (i)  The outstanding shares of Common  Stock have been, and  the 
Shares to be issued and sold by the  Company  upon such  issuance  will be, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and will not be subject
to any preemptive or similar right; and the Rights will be validly issued.

            (j)  The  description of the Common Stock  in  the  Registration 
Statement and the Prospectus, as they may be amended or supplemented, is, and at
the Closing Date and, if later,  the Option Closing Date,  will be, complete and
accurate  in all  material  respects.  Except  for  shares  issuable  under  the
Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, the Minnesota
Power and Affiliated  Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any compensation
plan  disclosed in the Company's  Proxy  Statement with respect to the Company's
1998  Annual  Meeting of  Shareholders  (collectively  referred to as the "Stock
Purchase and Compensation Plans"), the Company does not have outstanding, and at
the  Closing  Date  and,  if  later,  the  Option  Closing  Date,  will not have
outstanding,  any options to  purchase,  or any rights or warrants to  subscribe
for, or any  securities  or  obligations  convertible  into, or any contracts or
commitments to issue or sell, any shares of Common Stock,  any shares of capital
stock  of any  subsidiary  or  any  such  warrants,  convertible  securities  or
obligations.

            (k)  The Company has filed a Petition for  Certification of Capital
Structure   with  the  Minnesota   Public   Utilities   Commission   ("Minnesota
Commission")  pursuant to the Minnesota Public Utilities Act with respect to the
issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares.  The  Minnesota  Commission  has
entered an  authorizing  order  approving  the capital  structure  including the
issuance  and sale of the  Shares.  Apart  from  such  authorizing  order of the
Minnesota Commission,  no consent,  approval,  authorization or order of, or any
filing or declaration with, any court or governmental agency or body is required
for the  consummation  by the  Company of the  transactions  on its part  herein
contemplated,  except such as have been obtained  under the Act or the Rules and
Regulations  and such as may be required  under state  securities  or "Blue Sky"
laws or the by-laws and rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc.  (the  "NASD") in  connection  with the purchase  and  distribution  by the
Underwriters of the Shares to be sold by the Company.

            (l)  The  Company is duly registered as a transfer agent within the 
meaning  of the  Exchange  Act  with  respect  to  the  Common  Stock  and is in
compliance  with the  Exchange  Act Rules and  Regulations  with  respect to its
activities as transfer agent.

                                       6
<PAGE>

            (m)  Neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers or 
controlling persons has taken,  directly or indirectly,  any action intended, or
which  might  reasonably  be  expected,  to cause or  result,  under  the Act or
otherwise,  in, or which has  constituted,  stabilization or manipulation of the
price of any  security  of the Company to  facilitate  the sale or resale of the
Shares.

            (n)  No holder of securities of the Company has rights to the 
registration  of any  securities  of the  Company  because  of the filing of the
Registration Statement.

            (o)  The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and
sale  of  the  Shares  will  not  be,  an  "investment  company"  or  an  entity
"controlled"  by an  "investment  company",  as such  terms are  defined  in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

            (p)  Except as set forth in the  Registration  Statement and the 
Prospectus,  there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the
Company or any of its Material  Subsidiaries is a party or to which any property
of the  Company  or any of its  Material  Subsidiaries  is  subject,  which,  if
determined adversely to the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries would in
the  Company's  reasonable  judgment  individually  or in the  aggregate  have a
material  adverse  effect on the  management,  business,  properties,  financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries  taken as
a whole;  and, to the best of the Company's  knowledge,  no such proceedings are
threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.

            (q)  Except as set forth in the  Registration  Statement  and the 
Prospectus,  the Company and its Material  Subsidiaries  (i) are in  substantial
compliance with any and all applicable  foreign,  federal,  state and local laws
and  regulations  relating to the  protection  of human  health and safety,  the
environment  or  imposing  liability  or  standards  of conduct  concerning  any
Hazardous Material (as hereinafter  defined)  ("Environmental  Laws"), (ii) have
received  all material  permits,  licenses or other  approvals  required of them
under applicable  Environmental Laws to conduct their respective  businesses and
(iii) are in  substantial  compliance  with all terms and conditions of any such
permit, license or approval,  except where such noncompliance with Environmental
Laws,  failure to receive  required  permits,  licenses  or other  approvals  or
failure to comply with the terms and  conditions  of such  permits,  licenses or
approvals would not,  individually  or in the aggregate have a material  adverse
effect on the management,  business, properties,  financial condition or results
of operations  of the Company and its  subsidiaries  taken as a whole.  The term
"Hazardous  Material"  means (A) any  "hazardous  substance"  as  defined by the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended,  (B) any "hazardous waste" as defined by the Resource  Conservation and
Recovery  Act, as amended,  (C) any  petroleum  or  petroleum  product,  (D) any
polychlorinated  biphenyl and (E) any  pollutant or  contaminant  or  hazardous,
dangerous,  or toxic chemical,  material,  waste or substance regulated under or
within the meaning of any other Environmental Law.

         5. Agreements of the Company.

            (a)  The Company will not file any  amendment  or  supplement to the
Registration  Statement or the  Prospectus  unless a copy has first been
submitted to the  Representatives  a  reasonable  time before its filing and the
Representatives  have  not  reasonably  objected  to  it  in  writing  within  a
reasonable time after receiving the copy.

            (b)  The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) of the
initiation or threatening of any  proceedings  for, or receipt by the Company of
any notice with respect to, the  suspension of the  qualification  of the Shares
for sale in any  jurisdiction  or the  issuance  of any order by the  Commission
suspending the  effectiveness of the Registration  Statement and (ii) of receipt
by the  Company or any  representative  or  attorney of the Company of any other
communication  from the  Commission  relating to the Company,  the  Registration
Statement, any preliminary prospectus,  preliminary prospectus supplement or the
Prospectus or to the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  The Company
will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of an order suspending
the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement  and,  if any such  order is
issued, to obtain its lifting as soon as possible.

            (c)  The Company  will furnish to the Representatives without charge
one signed copy of the  Registration  Statement  and of any  amendments  thereto
(including  all exhibits  filed with any such  document)  and as many  conformed
copies  of  the  Registration  Statement  as  each  of the  Representatives  may
reasonably request.

            (d)  During such period as a  prospectus  is required by law to be  
delivered by the  Underwriters  or a dealer,  the Company will deliver,  without
charge,  to the  Underwriters  and to dealers,  at such office or offices as the
Representatives  may designate,  as many copies of the Prospectus as each of the
Representatives  may  reasonably  request,  and,  during such  period  after the
Effective Date if any event occurs as a result of which it is necessary to amend
or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements in it, in the light
of the  circumstances  existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser,
not misleading in any material respect, or if during such period it is necessary
to amend or  supplement  the  Prospectus  to  comply  with the Act or Rules  and
Regulations,  the Company will promptly prepare,  submit to the Representatives,
file,  subject to Section 5(a), with the Commission and deliver, without charge,
to each of the  Underwriters  and to  dealers  (whose  names and  addresses  the
Representatives  will  furnish to the Company) to whom Shares may have been sold
by the Underwriters,  and to other dealers on request, amendments or supplements
to the  Prospectus so that the  statements in the  Prospectus,  as so amended or
supplemented,  will not,  in the light of the  circumstances  existing  when the
Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser,  be  misleading in any material  respect
and will  comply  with the Act and the Rules and  Regulations.  Delivery  by the
Underwriters  of any such  amendments or supplements to the Prospectus  will not
constitute a waiver of any of the  conditions  in Section 6 of the  Underwriting
Agreement.

                                       8
<PAGE>

            (e)  The Company  will make  generally available  to the Company's  
security holders, as soon as practicable but in no event later than the last day
of the 15th full  calendar  month  following  the calendar  quarter in which the
Effective Date falls, an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations.

            (f)  The  Company  will  take  such actions as  the Representatives 
reasonably designate in order to qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the
securities  or "Blue  Sky"  laws of such  jurisdictions  as the  Representatives
reasonably designate.

            (g)  The Company will pay, or reimburse if paid by the 
Representatives,  whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, all costs and expenses incident
to the  performance  of the  obligations  of the Company  under this  Agreement,
including  costs and  expenses  relating to (i) the  preparation,  printing  and
filing of the  Registration  Statement and exhibits  thereto,  each  preliminary
prospectus,   each  preliminary  prospectus  supplement,   the  Prospectus,  all
amendments and  supplements to the  Registration  Statement and the  Prospectus,
(ii) the preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Shares, (iii)
the  registration  or  qualification  of the Shares for offer and sale under the
securities or "Blue Sky" laws of the  jurisdictions  referred to in Section 5(f)
and the  determination  of the legality of the Shares for investment,  including
the reasonable fees and  disbursements of counsel for the  Underwriters  (not to
exceed  $10,000)  in  that  connection,  and the  preparation  and  printing  of
preliminary  and   supplemental   "Blue  Sky"  memoranda  and  legal  investment
memoranda, (iv), the furnishing (including costs of shipping and mailing) to the
Underwriters  and to  dealers  of copies  of the  Registration  Statement,  each
preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements to the
Prospectus,  and of the  other  documents  required  by this  Section 5 to be so
furnished, (v) all transfer taxes, if any, with respect to the sale and delivery
of the Shares by the Company to the Underwriters, (vi) the listing of the Shares
on the New York Stock  Exchange,  (vii) any  filings  required to be made by the
Underwriters  with the NASD,  including the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Underwriters in that  connection,  and (viii) the transfer agent
for the Shares.

            (h)  During the period of two years commencing on the Effective 
Date, the Company will furnish to each  Underwriter who may so request copies of
such financial  statements and other periodic and special reports as the Company
may from time to time  distribute  generally  to the holders of any class of its
capital stock, and will furnish to the  Representatives and each Underwriter who
may so request a copy of each annual or other report it will be required to file
with the Commission.

            (i)  The  Company will not  at  any  time,  directly  or indirectly,
take any action  intended,  or which might  reasonably be expected,  to cause or
result in, or which will constitute, stabilization of the price of the shares of
Common Stock to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Shares.

                                       9
<PAGE>

            (j)  Unless  otherwise  agreed to in writing by the Company and the
Underwriters,  the  Company  will  not  for  a  period  of  30  days  after  the
commencement of the public  offering of the Shares sell or otherwise  dispose of
any  shares  of  Common  Stock,  rights to  acquire  shares  of Common  Stock or
securities   convertible   into  shares  of  Common  Stock  other  than  to  the
Underwriters  pursuant to this  Agreement and other than in connection  with the
Stock Purchase and Compensation Plans.

         6. Conditions of the Underwriters' Obligation. The obligation of each 
Underwriter  to purchase the Shares is subject to the  accuracy,  on the date of
this  Agreement and on the Closing Date and, with respect to the Option  Shares,
is  subject  to the  accuracy  on the date of this  Agreement  and on the Option
Closing Date, of the  representations  of the Company in this Agreement,  to the
accuracy and  completeness  of all statements  made by the Company or any of its
officers in any certificate  delivered to the  Representatives  or their counsel
pursuant to this  Agreement,  to performance  by the Company of its  obligations
under this Agreement and to each of the following additional conditions:

            (a)  All filings  required by Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations
must have been made.

            (b)  No stop order suspending the  effectiveness of the Registration
Statement  may be in effect and no  proceedings  for such purpose may be pending
before  or  threatened  by  the  Commission  and  any  requests  for  additional
information on the part of the  Commission  (to be included in the  Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or otherwise) must have been complied with and after
the date hereof no amendment or supplement to the Registration  Statement or the
Prospectus  shall have been filed unless a copy  thereof was first  submitted to
the  Representatives a reasonable time before its filing and the Representatives
did not  reasonably  object  thereto in writing  within a reasonable  time after
receiving the copy.

            (c)  Since the respective dates  as  of which such  information  is 
given in the Registration  Statement and the Prospectus,  as they may be amended
or supplemented, (i) there must not have been any material change in the capital
stock or long-term debt of the Company and its  subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,
(ii)  since  the  most  recent  dates as of  which  information  is given in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, there shall not have been any material
adverse  change,  or any  development  involving,  so far as the Company can now
reasonably  foresee,  a prospective  material adverse change, in the management,
business,  properties,  financial  condition  or  results of  operations  of the
Company  and its  subsidiaries,  considered  as a whole,  whether  or not in the
ordinary  course of business and, since such dates there shall not have been any
material transaction entered into by the Company, other than transactions in the
ordinary course of business and  transactions  contemplated in the  Registration
Statement or the  Prospectus,  and (iii) there must not have  occurred any event
that  makes  untrue or  incorrect  in any  material  respect  any  statement  or
information  contained  in  the  Prospectus  or  that  is not  reflected  in the
Prospectus  but should be  reflected  in it in order to make the  statements  or
information in it not misleading in any material respect; and in the judgment of
the  Representatives,  any such  development  referred to in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) makes

                                       10
<PAGE>

it  impracticable  to  consummate  the sale and  delivery  of the  Shares by the
Underwriters at the initial public offering price.

            (d)  The Representatives  must receive on the Closing Date and, with
respect to the Option Shares,  on the Option Closing Date, a certificate,  dated
such date, of the chief executive  officer,  the chief operating  officer or the
chief  financial  officer  of the  Company  certifying  that (i) the  signer has
carefully examined the Registration  Statement and the Prospectus (including any
Incorporated  Documents) and this  Agreement,  (ii) the  representations  of the
Company in this Agreement are accurate on and as of the date of the certificate,
(iii)  since  the most  recent  dates as of  which  information  is given in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, there shall not have been any material
adverse  change,  or any  development  involving,  so far as the Company can now
reasonably  foresee,  a prospective  material adverse change, in the management,
business,  properties,  financial  condition  or  results of  operations  of the
Company  and its  subsidiaries,  considered  as a whole,  whether  or not in the
ordinary  course of business and, since such dates there shall not have been any
material transaction entered into by the Company, other than transactions in the
ordinary course of business and  transactions  contemplated in the  Registration
Statement or the  Prospectus,  (iv) to the knowledge of such  officer,  no order
suspending the  effectiveness of the  Registration  Statement or prohibiting the
sale of the  Shares has been  issued and no  proceedings  for such  purpose  are
pending before or threatened by the  Commission,  (v) there has been no document
required  to be filed  under the  Exchange  Act and the  Exchange  Act Rules and
Regulations that upon such filing would be deemed to be an Incorporated Document
that has not been so filed,  and (vi) the Company has performed  all  agreements
that this Agreement requires it to perform by the Closing Date.

            (e)  The Representatives  must receive on the Closing Date and, with
respect to the  Option  Shares,  the Option  Closing  Date,  opinions  dated the
Closing Date  substantially  in the form of Annex B-1 and B-2 to this  Agreement
from Thelen Reid & Priest LLP, counsel to the Company,  and Philip R. Halverson,
Esq., general counsel of the Company, respectively.

            (f)  The  Representatives  must  receive on the Closing  Date from 
Morrison  Cohen Singer & Weinstein,  LLP,  their  counsel,  an opinion dated the
Closing Date and, with respect to the Option  Shares,  the Option  Closing Date,
with  respect to the  Company,  the  Shares,  the  Registration  Statement,  the
Prospectus, this Agreement and the form and sufficiency of all proceedings taken
in  connection  with the sale and  delivery  of the  Shares.  Such  opinion  and
proceedings  will be  satisfactory in all respects to the  Representatives.  The
Company  must  have  furnished  to such  counsel  such  documents  as  they  may
reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to render such opinion.

            (g)  On the date hereof and on the  Closing  Date and,  with respect
to the Option Shares, the Option Closing Date,  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP (the
"Accountants")  must furnish to the  Representatives a letter,  addressed to the
Representatives  and  in  form  and  substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to the
Representatives,  confirming that they are independent  accountants with respect
to the  Company  as  required  by the Act and the Rules and Regulations and with
respect  to the

                                       11
<PAGE>
financial  and  other  statistical  and  numerical  information contained in the
Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein.

            (h)  Prior to the Closing Date,  the Shares must be duly  authorized
for listing by the New York Stock Exchange upon official notice of issuance.

         All  opinions,   letters,  evidence and  certificates mentioned  above
or elsewhere in this  Agreement will comply with this Agreement only if they are
in form and scope satisfactory to counsel for the Representatives.

         7. Indemnification.

            (a)  The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter,
the  directors,  officers,  employees and agents of each  Underwriter,  and each
person, if any, who controls each Underwriter,  within the meaning of Section 15
of the Act or Section  20 of the  Exchange  Act,  from and  against  any and all
losses,  claims,  damages and liabilities,  joint or several (including,  as and
when incurred, any investigative, legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection  with,  and any amount paid in  settlement  of, any  action,  suit or
proceeding  or any claim  asserted)  to which they,  or any of them,  may become
subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state  statutory law
or  regulation,  at common law or  otherwise,  insofar as such  losses,  claims,
damages  or  liabilities  arise out of or are based on any untrue  statement  or
alleged  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact  contained  in any  preliminary
prospectus, preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the  Registration  Statement or the
Prospectus  (including any  Incorporated  Document),  or the omission or alleged
omission to state in it a material fact required to be stated in it or necessary
to make the statements in it not misleading; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be liable to the extent that such loss,  claim,  damage,  or liability
arises  from the sale of the Shares in the public  offering  to any person by an
Underwriter  and (i) is based on an untrue  statement  or  omission  or  alleged
untrue  statement  or  omission  made  in  reliance  on and in  conformity  with
information  furnished  in  writing  to the  Company  by or on  behalf  of  such
Underwriter  expressly for use in the  Registration  Statement,  any preliminary
prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus,  as set forth
in the last sentence of Section  4(b),  or (ii) results  solely from one or more
untrue statements of material facts contained in, or the omission of one or more
material  facts  from  any  preliminary  prospectus  or  preliminary  prospectus
supplement or the Prospectus,  which untrue  statement or omission was corrected
in the Prospectus (as then amended or  supplemented)  if the  Underwriters  sold
Shares to the person  alleging such loss,  claim,  liability,  expense or damage
without sending or giving, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale,
a copy of the  corrected  Prospectus  (as then amended or  supplemented)  if the
Company had previously furnished copies thereof to the Representatives  within a
reasonable  amount  of time  prior to such  sale or such  confirmation,  and the
Representatives failed to send or give the corrected Prospectus (as then amended
or supplemented),  if required by law to have so sent or given it and if sent or
given would have been a complete  defense with respect to such untrue  statement
or omission against the person asserting such loss, claim, liability, expense

                                       12
<PAGE>

or damage.  This indemnity  agreement shall be in addition to any liability that
the Company might otherwise have.

            (b)  Each Underwriter shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its officers  and  directors  and each person,  if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the  Exchange  Act,
to the  same  extent  as the  foregoing  indemnity  from  the  Company  to  each
Underwriter,  but only insofar as losses,  claims,  damages or liabilities arise
from  the  sale  of the  Shares  in the  public  offering  to any  person  by an
Underwriter and are based on any untrue  statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement  or  omission  made  in or in  reliance  on  and  in  conformity  with
information  furnished  in  writing  to the  Company  by or on  behalf  of  such
Underwriter  expressly for use in the  Registration  Statement,  any preliminary
prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus,  as set forth
in the last  sentence of Section  4(b).  This  indemnity  agreement  shall be in
addition to any liability that each Underwriters might otherwise have.

            (c)  Any party  that  proposes to assert the right to be indemnified
under this Section 7 shall,  promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of
any action  against such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against
an  indemnifying  party or parties  under this Section 7, notify in writing each
such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action,  enclosing a copy of
all papers served,  but the omission so to notify such indemnifying  party shall
not  relieve it from any  liability  that it may have to any  indemnified  party
otherwise  than under this Section 7. If any such action is brought  against any
indemnified  party and it notifies the indemnifying  party of its  commencement,
the  indemnifying  party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent
that it elects by delivering  written notice to the  indemnified  party promptly
after  receiving  notice of the  commencement of the action from the indemnified
party,  jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified,  to assume
the  defense  of  the  action,  with  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to  the
indemnified  party,  and,  after  notice  from  the  indemnifying  party  to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense,  the indemnifying party
shall  not be liable to the  indemnified  party for any legal or other  expenses
except as provided  below and except for the reasonable  costs of  investigation
subsequently  incurred by the indemnified  party in connection with the defense.
The  indemnified  party  shall have the right to employ its  counsel in any such
action,  but the fees and  expenses of such  counsel  shall be at the expense of
such  indemnified  party unless (i) the employment of counsel by the indemnified
party  has been  authorized  in  writing  by the  indemnifying  party,  (ii) the
indemnified  party has  reasonably  concluded  (based on advice of counsel) that
there may be legal defenses  available to it or other  indemnified  parties that
are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying  party,
(iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the
indemnified  party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in
which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense
of such  action  on behalf of the  indemnified  party) or (iv) the  indemnifying
party has not in fact  employed  counsel  to assume the  defense of such  action
within a  reasonable  time after  receiving  notice of the  commencement  of the
action,  in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the
expense  of the  indemnifying  party  or  parties.  It is  understood  that  the
indemnifying  party or parties shall not, in connection  with any  proceeding or
related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the

                                       13
<PAGE>

reasonable  fees,  disbursements  and other  charges  of more than one  separate
counsel  admitted to practice in such  jurisdiction at any one time for all such
indemnified  party or parties.  All such fees,  disbursements  and other charges
will be reimbursed by the indemnifying  party promptly as they are incurred.  An
indemnifying  party will not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim
effected  without its written  consent (which  consent will not be  unreasonably
withheld).  No  indemnifying  party  shall,  without the written  consent of the
indemnified  party,  effect the  settlement or compromise  of, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim
in respect of which  indemnification  or  contribution  may be sought  hereunder
(whether or not the  indemnified  party is an actual or potential  party to such
action or claim) unless such settlement,  compromise or judgment (i) includes an
unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of
such  action  or claim  and (ii)  does not  include  a  statement  as to,  or an
admission  of,  fault,  culpability  or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any
indemnified party.

         8. Contribution.  In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution  in the  circumstances  in which the  indemnification  provided for
under the foregoing provisions of Section 7 is applicable in accordance with its
terms  but for any  reason is held to be  unavailable  from the  Company  or the
Underwriters,  the Company and the  Underwriters  shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable as a result of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages
(including any investigative,  legal and other expenses  reasonably  incurred in
connection  with,  and any amount paid in  settlement  of, any  action,  suit or
proceeding  or any claim  asserted)  to which the Company and any one or more of
the  Underwriters  may be subject in such  proportion as shall be appropriate to
reflect the  relative  benefits  received by the Company on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other,  the relative fault of the Company,  on the one hand,
and the Underwriters,  on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions
which resulted in such loss, claim,  liability,  expense or damage, or action in
respect thereof,  as well as any other relevant  equitable  considerations  with
respect to such offering. Such relative benefits shall be in the same proportion
as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received
by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received
by the  Underwriters in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of
the  Prospectus.  Such relative  fault shall be  determined by reference,  among
other things,  to whether the untrue or alleged  untrue  statement of a material
fact or  omission  or  alleged  omission  to state a  material  fact  relates to
information supplied by the Company or by or on behalf of the Representatives on
behalf of the  Underwriters,  the  intent  of the  parties  and  their  relative
knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not
be just and  equitable  if  contributions  pursuant to this Section 8 were to be
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters  were treated as one
entity for such  purpose) or by any other  method of  allocation  which does not
take into account the equitable  considerations  referred to herein.  The amount
paid or  payable  by an  indemnified  party  as a  result  of the  loss,  claim,
liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in
this  Section 8 shall be deemed to include,  for purpose of this  Section 8, any
legal  or  other  expenses  reasonably  incurred  by such  indemnified  party in
connection   with   investigating   or  defending  any  such  action  or  claim.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this  Section  8, no  Underwriter  shall be
required  to  contribute  any  amount in excess  of the  underwriting  discounts
received by it, except that insofar as losses,  claims,  damages and liabilities
arise  from the 

                                       14
<PAGE>

sale of the Shares in the public  offering to any person by an  Underwriter  and
are based on any untrue  statement  or omission or alleged  untrue  statement or
omission made in or in reliance on and in conformity with information  furnished
in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter  expressly for use
in  the  Registration  Statement,  any  preliminary  prospectus  or  preliminary
prospectus  supplement or the  Prospectus,  as set forth in the last sentence of
Section  4(b),  no  Underwriter  shall be required to  contribute  any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total  price at which the Shares  underwritten
by it and  distributed  to the public  were  offered to the public  exceeds  the
amount of any damages which such  Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such  untrue or alleged  untrue  statement  or  omission or alleged
omission.  No person found guilty of  fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution  from any
person  who  was  not   guilty  of  such   fraudulent   misrepresentation.   The
Underwriters'  obligations  to  contribute  as  provided  in this  Section 8 are
several in  proportion  to their  respective  underwriting  obligations  and not
joint.  For  purposes of this Section 8, any person who controls a party to this
Agreement  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act  will  have  the  same  rights  to
contribution  as that  party,  and each  officer of the  Company  who signed the
Registration Statement will have the same rights to contribution as the Company,
subject  in  each  case  to  the  provisions   hereof.  Any  party  entitled  to
contribution,  promptly  after receipt of notice of  commencement  of any action
against  such  party in respect  of which a claim for  contribution  may be made
under  this  Section  8,  will  notify  any such  party  or  parties  from  whom
contribution  may be sought,  but the omission so to notify will not relieve the
party or parties from whom  contribution may be sought from any other obligation
it or they  may  have  under  this  Section  8. No  party  will  be  liable  for
contribution  with  respect to any action or claim  settled  without its written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).

         9. Termination. The obligations of the several Underwriters under this
Agreement  may be terminated at any time on or before the Closing Date (or, with
respect to the Option Shares, on or before the Option Closing Date) by notice to
the  Company  from the  Representatives,  without  liability  on the part of any
Underwriter  to the Company,  if,  subsequent to the date of this  Agreement and
prior to delivery and payment for the Shares (or the Option Shares), as the case
may be, (a) in the  judgment of the  Representatives,  (i) trading in any of the
equity securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission, by
an exchange that lists the Shares or by the Nasdaq Stock Market, (ii) trading in
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or
limited or minimum or maximum  prices shall have been  generally  established on
such exchange, or additional material governmental restrictions, not in force on
the date of this  Agreement,  shall have been imposed upon trading in securities
generally by such  exchange or by order of the  Commission or any court or other
governmental  authority,  (iii) a general  banking  moratorium  shall  have been
declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) any outbreak or
material  escalation of  hostilities  or  declaration  by the United States of a
national  emergency or war or other calamity or crisis shall have occurred,  the
effect  of any  of  which  is  such  as to  make  it,  in  the  judgment  of the
Representatives, impracticable to proceed with the public offering of the Shares
the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, or (b)
any of the conditions specified in Section 6 have not been fulfilled when and as
required by this Agreement.

                                       15
<PAGE>
         If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof,  
the Company shall not then be under any liability to any  Underwriter  except as
provided in  Sections  5(g),  7 and 8 hereof;  but, if because of any failure or
refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement or
because any of the conditions in Section 6 are not satisfied, the Shares are not
delivered  by or on behalf of the Company as provided  herein,  the Company will
reimburse the Underwriters  through the  Representatives  for all  out-of-pocket
expenses,  including fees and disbursements of counsel,  reasonably  incurred by
the Underwriters in making  preparations for the purchase,  sale and delivery of
the Shares,  but the  Company  shall then be under no further  liability  to any
Underwriter except as provided in Sections 5(g), 7 and 8 hereof.

         10. Substitution of Underwriters. If one or more of the Underwriters 
shall,  for any reason  permitted  hereunder,  cancel its obligation to purchase
hereunder and to take up and pay for the Firm Shares to be purchased by such one
or more  Underwriters,  the  Company  shall  immediately  notify  the  remaining
Underwriters,  and the remaining  Underwriters  shall have the right,  within 24
hours  of  receipt  of such  notice,  either  to  take  up and pay for (in  such
proportion  as  may  be  agreed  upon  among  them)  or  to  substitute  another
underwriter or underwriters, satisfactory to the Company, to take up and pay for
the number of Firm Shares that such one or more  Underwriters  did not purchase.
If one or more Underwriters  shall, for any reason other than a reason permitted
hereunder,  fail to take up and pay for the Firm Shares to be  purchased by such
one or more  Underwriters,  the Company shall  immediately  notify the remaining
Underwriters,  and the remaining  Underwriters shall be obligated to take up and
pay for (in addition to the respective  number of Firm Shares set forth opposite
their  respective  names in  Schedule  1), the number of Firm  Shares  that such
defaulting  Underwriter or  Underwriters  failed to take up and pay for, up to a
number  thereof equal to, in the case of each such  remaining  Underwriter,  ten
percent  (10%) of the number of Firm Shares set forth  opposite the name of such
remaining Underwriter in Schedule 1, and such remaining  Underwriters shall have
the right, within 24 hours of receipt of such notice,  either to take up and pay
for (in such  proportion  as may be agreed upon among  them),  or to  substitute
another underwriter or underwriters, satisfactory to the Company, to take up and
pay for, the remaining number of the Firm Shares that the defaulting Underwriter
or Underwriters  agreed but failed to purchase.  If any unpurchased  Firm Shares
still  remain,  then the  Company or the  Underwriters  shall be  entitled to an
additional  period of 24 hours within which to procure another party or parties,
who are members of the NASD (or if not members of the NASD, who are not eligible
for  membership in the NASD and who agree (i) to make no sales within the United
States,  its  territories  or its  possessions  or to persons  who are  citizens
thereof or residents  therein and (ii) in making sales to comply with the NASD's
Rules of Fair Practice) and satisfactory to the Company, to purchase or agree to
purchase such unpurchased Firm Shares on the terms herein set forth. In any such
case,  either the remaining  Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to
postpone the Closing Date for a period not to exceed  seven full  business  days
from the date agreed upon in accordance  with this Section 10, in order that the
necessary  changes in the  Registration  Statement and  Prospectus and any other
documents and arrangements may be effected.  If the Underwriters and the Company
shall fail to procure a  satisfactory  party or  parties  as above  provided  to
purchase or agree to purchase such unpurchased Firm Shares, then the Company may
either (i) require the  remaining  Underwriters  to purchase  the number of Firm
Shares  that they are  obligated  to purchase  hereunder  (but no more than 

                                       16
<PAGE>

such number of Firm Shares) or (ii)  terminate  this  Agreement by giving prompt
notice to the Underwriters. In the event that neither the remaining Underwriters
nor the Company has arranged for the purchase of such unpurchased Firm Shares by
another  party or parties as above  provided  and the Company has not elected to
require the  remaining  Underwriters  to purchase the number of Firm Shares that
they are obligated to purchase  hereunder,  then this Agreement  shall terminate
without any liability on the part of any such Underwriter or the Company for the
purchase or sale of any Shares under this  Agreement.  Any action taken pursuant
to this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting  Underwriter  from liability
in respect of any default of such Underwriters under this Agreement.

         11. Miscellaneous.  The reimbursement, indemnification and contribution
agreements in Sections 5, 7, 8 and 9 and the  representations  and agreements of
the Company and the Underwriters in this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect regardless of any termination of this Agreement,  any investigation  made
by or on behalf of the Underwriters,  the Company, or any controlling person and
delivery and acceptance of and payment for the Shares.

         This  Agreement  is  for  the  benefit  of  the  several Underwriters,
the Company,  and their successors and assigns,  and, to the extent expressed in
this Agreement,  for the benefit of persons controlling the several Underwriters
or the Company,  directors and officers of the Company and directors,  officers,
employees  and  agents  of  the  several  Underwriters,   and  their  respective
successors  and  assigns,  and no other  persons,  partnership,  association  or
corporation will acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.
The term  "successors and assigns" does not include any purchaser of Shares from
any of the Underwriters merely because of such purchase.

         All notices  and  communications under this  Agreement shall  be  in 
writing  and  mailed or  delivered,  by  messenger,  facsimile  transmission  or
otherwise,  if to the  Underwriters,  to the  Representatives  at the offices of
PaineWebber  Incorporated  at c/o PaineWebber  Incorporated,  1285 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, NY 10019, Attention: Corporate Finance Department, and if to
the Company,  at 30 West Superior Street,  Duluth,  Minnesota 55802,  Attention:
Chief Financial Officer. Any such notice or communication shall take effect upon
receipt thereof.

         THIS   AGREEMENT   SHALL  BE  GOVERNED  BY  AND  CONSTRUED  IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT
OF LAWS PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.

         This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts with the same
effect as if the  signatures  thereto  and hereto were upon the same instrument.

         This Agreement  may not be  amended or otherwise  modified or  any 
provision  hereof  waived  except  by an  instrument  in  writing  signed by the
Underwriters and the Company.

Dear Sirs:

                  Reference  is  made  to  the  Underwriting  Agreement,   dated
September __, 1998 (the "Underwriting  Agreement"),  among Minnesota Power, Inc.
(the  "Company")  and the  several  Underwriters  named in Schedule 1 hereto and

terms and conditions set forth therein,  of an aggregate of 2,000,000  shares of

preferred share purchase rights  attached  thereto (the "Rights")  (collectively
referred to as the "Firm Shares"). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Underwriting Agreement,  the Company has also granted to the Underwriters
an option  (the  "Option")  to purchase up to an  additional  300,000  shares of
Common Stock and the Rights attached  thereto  (collectively  referred to as the

share.

Underwriters that the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in

part of this Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement.

 As Representatives of the several Underwriters
c/o PaineWebber Incorporated

New York, New York 10019

Dear Sirs:

                  Reference is made to the sale by Minnesota  Power,  Inc.  (the
"Company") of an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of its Common Stock,  without par
value (the "Common  Stock"),  and the preferred  share purchase  rights attached
thereto  (the  "Rights")  (the Common  Stock and the Rights  being  collectively
referred to as the "Shares"). We advise you that we have acted as counsel to the
Company in connection  with such issuance and sale and have  participated in the
preparation of (a) Registration Statement No. 333-52161, as filed by the Company
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission for the  registration of the Shares
under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended (the "Act")  (such  registration
statement,  as  amended  at the  Effective  Date (as such term is defined in the
Agreement referred to below), being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration
Statement"); (b) the prospectus constituting part of the Registration Statement,
as amended and supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated September __, 1998,
relating to the Shares (such prospectus,  as so amended and supplemented,  being
hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus"); and (c) the Underwriting Agreement
dated  September  __, 1998,  between the Company and you  (the"Agreement").  All
references   in  this  opinion  to  the   Agreement   shall  include  the  Price
Determination  Agreement referred to therein. In addition,  we have reviewed the
petition  filed by the Company with the Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission
seeking  authorization  to  issue  the  Shares,  and the  order  issued  by said
Commission in response to said petition.

                  We  have  reviewed  all  corporate  proceedings  taken  by the
Company in respect of the issuance and sale of the Shares.

                  Upon the basis of our familiarity with these transactions,  we
are of the opinion that:



<PAGE>

                  1. The Shares when paid for by the  Underwriters in accordance
with the terms of the Agreement will be, duly authorized,  validly issued, fully
paid and  non-assessable  and will not be subject to any  preemptive  or similar
right; and the Rights will be validly issued.

                  2. An  authorizing  order  has been  issued  by the  Minnesota
Public  Utilities  Commission  certifying  the Company's  capital  structure and
authorizing  the  issuance  and  sale of the  Shares,  and,  to the  best of our
knowledge,  said  order  is still  in full  force  and  effect;  and no  further
approval,  authorization,  consent or order of any public  board or body  (other
than in  connection or in compliance  with the  provisions of the  securities or
"Blue Sky" laws of any  jurisdiction) is legally required for the  authorization
of the issuance and sale of the Shares.

                  3. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except as to
the financial statements, statement of income and other financial or statistical
data  contained  therein,  upon  which we do not pass)  comply as to form in all
material   respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  Act  and  the  applicable
instructions,  rules and  regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
thereunder;  the Registration  Statement has become,  and at the date hereof the
Registration  Statement  is,  effective  under the Act,  and, to the best of our
knowledge,  no proceedings  for a stop order with respect thereto are pending or
threatened under Section 8 of the Act.

                  4. The  statements  set  forth  in the  Prospectus  under  the
captions  "Description  of Common  Stock" and  "Description  of Preferred  Share
Purchase  Rights,"  insofar  as they  purport  to  constitute  a summary  of the
securities, documents and instruments therein described, are accurate and fairly
present the information contained therein in all material respects.

                  5.  The  Agreement  has  been  duly  and  validly  authorized,
executed  and  delivered  by the  Company  and is a valid  and  legally  binding
obligation of the Company.

                  6. The  Company is not an  "investment  company"  or an entity
"controlled"  by an  "investment  company",  as such  terms are  defined  in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

                  In passing upon the forms of the  Registration  Statement  and
the Prospectus,  we necessarily  assume the correctness and  completeness of the
statements  made or included  therein by the Company and take no  responsibility
therefor, except insofar as such statements relate to us and as set forth in the
Prospectus  under the heading "Legal  Opinions" and in paragraph 4 above. In the
course of the preparation by the Company of the  Registration  Statement and the
Prospectus,   we  have  had  conferences   with  certain  of  its  officers  and
representatives,    with   other    counsel    for   the    Company   and   with
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, the independent  certified  public  accountants who
examined certain of the Company's financial statements incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement. Our examination of the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus,  and our discussions in the above-mentioned  conferences did not
disclose to us any  information  which gives us reason to believe  that,  at the
Effective Date, the  Registration  Statement  contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated  therein
or  necessary  to make  the 

                                       2

Dear Sirs:

                  Reference is made to the sale by Minnesota  Power,  Inc.  (the
"Company") of an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of its Common Stock,  without par
value (the "Common  Stock"),  and the preferred  share purchase  rights attached
thereto  (the  "Rights")  (the Common  Stock and the Rights  being  collectively
referred to as the  "Shares").  I advise you that I have acted as counsel to the
Company in connection  with such issuance and sale and have  participated in the
preparation of (a) Registration Statement No. 333-52161, as filed by the Company
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission for the  registration of the Shares
under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended (the "Act")  (such  registration
statement,  as  amended  at the  Effective  Date (as such term is defined in the
Agreement referred to below), being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration
Statement"); (b) the prospectus constituting part of the Registration Statement,
as amended and supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated September __, 1998,
relating to the Shares (such prospectus,  as so amended and supplemented,  being
hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus"); and (c) the Underwriting Agreement
dated  September  __, 1998,  between the Company and you  (the"Agreement").  All
references   in  this  opinion  to  the   Agreement   shall  include  the  Price
Determination  Agreement referred to therein.  In addition,  I have reviewed the
petition  filed by the Company with the Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission
seeking  authorization  to  issue  the  Shares,  and the  order  issued  by said
Commission in response to said petition.

<PAGE>

                  I have reviewed all corporate proceedings taken by the Company
in respect of the issuance and sale of the Shares.

                  Upon the basis of my familiarity  with these  transactions and
with the Company's properties and affairs generally, I am of the opinion that:

                  1. The Shares, when paid for by the Underwriters in accordance
with the terms of the Agreement, will be duly authorized,  validly issued, fully
paid and  non-assessable  and will not be subject to any  preemptive  or similar
right;  and the Rights will be validly issued.  Except for shares issuable under
the Company's  Automatic  Dividend  Reinvestment  and Stock  Purchase  Plan, the
Minnesota  Power and  Affiliated  Companies  Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any
compensation plan disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement with respect to the
Company's  1998 Annual  Meeting of  Shareholders,  to the best of my  knowledge,
there is no commitment or  arrangement  to issue,  and there are no  outstanding
options,  warrants or other  rights  calling for the  issuance  of, any share of
capital stock of the Company or any  subsidiary to any person or any security or
other  instrument  that by its terms is  convertible  into,  exercisable  for or
exchangeable for capital stock of the Company.

                  2. An  authorizing  order  has been  issued  by the  Minnesota
Public  Utilities  Commission  certifying  the Company's  capital  structure and
authorizing  the  issuance  and  sale  of the  Shares,  and,  to the  best of my
knowledge,  said  order  is still  in full  force  and  effect;  and no  further
approval,  authorization,  consent or order of any public  board or body  (other
than in  connection or in compliance  with the  provisions of the  securities or
"Blue Sky" laws of any  jurisdiction) is legally required for the  authorization
of the issuance and sale of the Shares.

                  3. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except as to
the financial statements, statement of income and other financial or statistical
data  contained  therein,  upon  which I do not  pass)  comply as to form in all
material   respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  Act  and  the  applicable
instructions,  rules and  regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
thereunder;  the Registration  Statement has become,  and at the date hereof the
Registration  Statement  is,  effective  under the Act,  and,  to the best of my
knowledge,  no proceedings  for a stop order with respect thereto are pending or
threatened under Section 8 of the Act.

                  4. The  statements  set  forth  in the  Prospectus  under  the
captions  "Description  of Common  Stock" and  "Description  of Preferred  Share
Purchase  Rights,"  insofar  as they  purport  to  constitute  a summary  of the
securities, documents and instruments therein described, are accurate and fairly
present the information contained therein in all material respects.

                  7. To the best of my  knowledge,  except as  disclosed  in the
Registration  Statement or the Prospectus,  no person or entity has the right to
require  the  registration  under the Act of  shares  of  Common  Stock or other
securities  of the  Company  by reason of the  filing  or  effectiveness  of the
Registration Statement.

                                       2

                  5. The Company has full corporate power and authority to enter
into  this  Agreement.  The  Agreement  has been  duly and  validly  authorized,
executed  and  delivered  by the  Company  and is a valid  and  legally  binding
obligation of the Company.

                  6. The Company is a validly organized and existing corporation
under the laws of the State of Minnesota  and is duly  qualified to do business,
and is doing business, in that State.

                  7. The Company is a public utility corporation duly authorized
by its  Articles  of  Incorporation  to  conduct  the  business  which it is now
conducting  as set  forth in the  Prospectus  and the  Company  holds  valid and
subsisting  franchises,  licenses  and  permits  authorizing  it to carry on the
utility business in which it is engaged.

                  8.  Each  Material  Subsidiary  of the  Company  is a  validly
organized  and  existing  corporation  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  its
incorporation  and is duly qualified to do business,  and is doing business,  in
such State and in each other  State in which the failure to qualify as a foreign
corporation  would be material to the Company and its  subsidiaries,  taken as a
whole.

                  9. Other than as stated in the Registration  Statement and the
Prospectus  there are no pending legal  proceedings  to which the Company or any
Material  Subsidiary  is a party  or of which  property  of the  Company  or any
Material  Subsidiary  is the subject,  which  depart from the  ordinary  routine
litigation incident to the kind of business conducted by the Company or any such
Material Subsidiary,  and which is material to the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole,  and, to the best of my  knowledge,  no such  proceedings  are
known to be contemplated by governmental authorities.

                  10.  The   portions  of  the  answers  to  the  items  of  the
Registration  Statement  and the  portions of the  information  contained in the
Prospectus,  which are  stated  therein  to have been  made on my  authority  as
General  Counsel of the Company,  have been reviewed by me and, as to matters of
law and legal conclusions, are correct.

                  11. Neither the issue and sale by the Company of the Shares as
contemplated  by the Agreement nor the  consummation by the Company of the other
transactions  contemplated  by the  Agreement  conflicts  with,  or results in a
breach of, the charter or by-laws of the Company or any Material  Subsidiary  or
any  agreement  or  instrument  known to me to which the Company or any Material
Subsidiary  is a party or by which the  Company or any  Material  Subsidiary  is
bound,  any law or  regulation  or,  so far as is  known  to me,  any  order  or
regulation of any court, governmental instrumentality or arbitrator.

                  12. To the best of my knowledge,  the Company is not currently
in breach of, or in default under, any material written  agreement or instrument
to which it is a party or by which it or its property is bound or affected,  and
which breach or default is material to the Company and its  subsidiaries,  taken
as a whole.

                                       3

                  In passing upon the forms of the  Registration  Statement  and
the Prospectus,  I necessarily  assume the  correctness and  completeness of the
statements  made or included  therein by the Company and take no  responsibility
therefor, except insofar as such statements relate to me and as set forth in the
Prospectus under the headings "Experts" and "Legal Opinions" and in paragraphs 4
and  10  above.  In  the  course  of  the  preparation  by  the  Company  of the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus, I had conferences with certain of its
officers  and  representatives,  with other  counsel  for the  Company  and with
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, the independent  certified  public  accountants who
examined certain of the Company's financial statements incorporated by reference
in the Registration  Statement. My examination of the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus,  and my discussions in the  above-mentioned  conferences did not
disclose to me any  information  which gives me reason to believe  that,  at the
Effective Date, the  Registration  Statement  contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated  therein
or  necessary  to make  the  statements  therein  not  misleading  or  that  the
Prospectus at the time it was filed  electronically with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 424, and the Prospectus,  as amended or supplemented at the date hereof,
contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements  therein,  in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  I do
not express any opinion or belief as to the financial  statements,  statement of
income or other  financial  or  statistical  data  included in the  Registration
Statement or in the Prospectus.

                                                Very truly yours,



                                                Philip R. Halverson
