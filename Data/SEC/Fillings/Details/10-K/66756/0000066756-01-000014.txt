SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (Reform  Act),  we are hereby  filing  cautionary
statements  identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to
differ  materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such
term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of ALLETE in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K,  in  presentations,  in response to questions or otherwise.
Any  statements  that  express,  or  involve  discussions  as to,  expectations,
beliefs, plans, objectives,  assumptions or future events or performance (often,
but not  always,  through  the use of words or  phrases  such as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects,"
"will  likely  result,"  "will  continue,"  or  similar   expressions)  are  not
statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond our  control and may cause  actual  results to differ
materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

     -   prevailing  governmental  policies and  regulatory  actions,  including
         those of the United States Congress, state legislatures,  the FERC, the
         MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the PSCW and various county regulators, about
         allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and
         disposal of assets and facilities,  operation and construction of plant
         facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital  investments,  and
         present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including but
         not limited to transmission costs);

     -   economic and geographic factors, including political and economic
         risks;

     -   changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
         policies;

     -   weather conditions;

     -   population growth rates and demographic patterns;

     -   competition for retail and wholesale customers;

     -   pricing and transportation of commodities;

     -   market demand, including structural market changes;

     -   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;

     -   changes in project costs;

     -   unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;

     -   capital market conditions;

     -   competition for new energy development opportunities; and

     -   legal  and  administrative  proceedings  (whether  civil  or  criminal)
         and  settlements  that  influence  the  business  and  profitability of
         ALLETE.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking  statement
to reflect  events or  circumstances  after the date on which that  statement is
made or to reflect the occurrence of  unanticipated  events.  New factors emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for  management to predict all of these
factors, nor can it assess the impact of each of these factors on the businesses
of ALLETE or the extent to which any factor,  or  combination  of  factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

ALLETE is a  multi-services  company  incorporated  under the laws of  Minnesota
since 1906. ALLETE is legally  incorporated as Minnesota Power, Inc.  References
in  this  report  to  "we"  and  "our"  are  to  ALLETE  and  its  subsidiaries,
collectively.

We have  operations  in 43 states and nine  Canadian  provinces  engaged in four
business segments:

     -   ENERGY SERVICES includes electric and gas services, coal mining and
         telecommunications;

     -   AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES includes a network of vehicle auctions,  a finance
         company,  an auto transport company, a vehicle  remarketing  company, a
         company that  provides  field  information  services to the  automotive
         industry and its lenders,  and a company that  provides  Internet-based
         parts location and insurance adjustment audit services nationwide;

     -   WATER SERVICES includes water and wastewater services; and

     -   INVESTMENTS  includes real estate  operations,  investments in emerging
         technologies  related to the electric utility industry and a securities
         portfolio.

Corporate charges represent general corporate expenses,  including interest, not
specifically related to any one business segment. As of December 31, 2000 we had
approximately 13,000 employees, 4,000 of which were not full time.

Since the inception of the 1996  corporate  strategic  plan, we have pursued and
will  continue to pursue a course of expanding our existing  business  segments.
Acquisitions have been and will continue to be a primary means of expansion.

Energy  Services  continues to pursue plans to  construct  in  partnership  with
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation a 250-mile,  345-kilovolt transmission line
from  Wausau,  Wisconsin  to Duluth,  Minnesota  and pursue  regional  wholesale
merchant  generating  plant  opportunities.  In 2000 Minnesota Power in alliance
with Great River formed Split Rock. (See Energy Services.)  Minnesota Power also
signed an  agreement  to install,  by  mid-2001,  a 24-MW  turbine  generator at
Potlatch  Corp.'s  facility in Cloquet,  Minnesota and Electric Odyssey expanded
into the Minneapolis/St. Paul area.

In 2000 and early  2001  Automotive  Services  expanded  significantly  with the
addition of 28 vehicle auction facilities and 19 auction facilities that provide
"total loss" vehicle recovery services to insurance  companies.  These additions
established ADESA as the premier  automotive  services company in Canada and the
second largest vehicle auction  business in North America and position us as the
third  largest  provider  of "total  loss"  vehicle  recovery  services in North
America.

In 2000 Water Services  experienced customer growth through increased population
in the states  they serve and the  acquisition  of Spruce  Creek in Florida  and
other small water and wastewater  systems in North  Carolina and Florida.  Water
Services also closed on a transaction,  subject to certain conditions, that will

In 2000  Investments sold its investment in ACE and reported record sales by its
real estate operations.

ENERGY SERVICES

The businesses we include in Energy  Services  generate,  transmit,  distribute,
market  and trade  electricity.  Coal  mining  and  telecommunications  are also
included  in  Energy  Services.   The  discussion  below  summarizes  the  major
businesses we include in Energy Services.  Statistical  information is presented
as of December  31, 2000.  All  subsidiaries  are wholly owned unless  otherwise
specifically indicated.

MINNESOTA  POWER provides  electricity in a 26,000 square mile electric  service
territory  located in  northeastern  Minnesota.  Minnesota Power supplies retail
electric  service to 130,000  customers  and  wholesale  electric  service to 16
municipalities.  SWL&P sells  electricity  and natural gas,  and provides  water
service in northwestern Wisconsin.  SWL&P has 14,000 electric customers,  11,000
natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers.

Minnesota  Power had an annual net peak load of 1,454 MW on December  11,  2000.
Our power supply sources are shown below.

We have electric  transmission and  distribution  lines of 500 kilovolts (kV) (8
miles),  230 kV (606 miles),  161 kV (43 miles), 138 kV (6 miles), 115 kV (1,259
miles) and less than 115 kV (6,393  miles).  We own and operate 177  substations
with a total capacity of 8,534  megavoltamperes.  Some of our  transmission  and
distribution lines interconnect with other utilities.

We own offices and service  buildings,  an energy control center,  repair shops,
motor  vehicles,   construction   equipment  and  tools,  office  furniture  and
equipment, and lease offices and storerooms in various localities. Substantially
all of our electric plant is subject to our mortgages  which  collateralize  our
outstanding  first  mortgage  bonds.  Generally,  our properties are held by the
Company  in  fee  and  are  free  from  other  encumbrances,  subject  to  minor
exceptions. Some property,  including certain offices and equipment, is utilized
under leases.  Some of our electric  lines are located on land not owned in fee,
but  are  covered  by  necessary  permits  of  governmental  authorities  or  by
appropriate  easement  rights.  In 1990 we sold a portion of  Boswell  Unit 4 to
WPPI.  WPPI has the right to use our  transmission  line facilities to transport
its share of generation.

MPEX is Minnesota Power's power marketing division which buys and sells capacity
and energy in the wholesale power market. Customers are other power suppliers in
the Midwest and Canada. During 2000 Minnesota Power and Great River formed Split
Rock.  Headquartered  in Elk River,  Minnesota,  Great River is a consumer-owned
generation  and  transmission  cooperative  and is  Minnesota's  second  largest
utility in terms of generating capacity.  Split Rock combines the two companies'
power supply  capabilities  and  customer  loads for power pool  operations  and
generation  outage  protection.  Ownership  of  generation  assets  and  current
customer supply  arrangements  have not changed for either  company.  Split Rock
contracts for wholesale power marketing services from MPEX.

BNI  COAL  owns and  operates  a  lignite  mine in North  Dakota.  Two  electric
generating  cooperatives,  Minnkota  Power and Square Butte,  presently  consume
virtually  all of BNI Coal's  production  of lignite coal under  cost-plus  coal
supply  agreements  expiring in 2027.  (See Fuel and Note 14.) A large dragline,
shop complex and other  property at BNI Coal are leased under a leveraged  lease
agreement  that expires in 2002.  During 2000 BNI Coal entered into an agreement
to purchase in 2002 all  property and  equipment  subject to this lease for $4.7
million.

ELECTRIC OUTLET,  INC., doing business as Electric  Odyssey,  is a retail store,
catalog  and  e-commerce  merchandiser  that  sells  electric-related  products.
Electric  Odyssey has three Minnesota  stores located in leased mall facilities.
Its catalogs are  distributed  nationwide.  In  addition,  Electric  Odyssey has
established alliances with several utilities, membership-based organizations and
other Internet  businesses to market Electric  Odyssey products through Internet
electronic commerce.

MP TELECOM provides highly reliable fiber optic-based communication and advanced
data services to businesses  and  communities  in Minnesota  and  Wisconsin.  MP
Telecom  owns or has rights to  approximately  1,500  route miles of fiber optic
cable. These route miles contain multiple fibers that total approximately 47,500
fiber miles. MP Telecom also owns optronic and data switching  equipment that is
used to  "light  up" the  fiber  optic  cable and  provides  customer  bandwidth
services.  Most of the locations  from which MP Telecom  services  customers are
leased from third parties.

RAINY RIVER is engaged in wholesale power marketing. (See Wholesale Electric
Sales.)

RETAIL ELECTRIC SALES

Approximately  62% of the ore consumed by  integrated  steel  facilities  in the
Great Lakes region  originates from five taconite  customers of Minnesota Power.
Taconite, an iron-bearing rock of relatively low iron content that is abundantly
available in Minnesota,  is an important domestic source of raw material for the
steel  industry.  Taconite  processing  plants use large  quantities of electric
power to grind the  ore-bearing  rock,  and  agglomerate  and pelletize the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 47
million tons in 2000 (43 million tons in 1999;  47 million tons in 1998).  Based
on our research of the taconite industry, Minnesota taconite production for 2001
is  anticipated to be about 37 million tons.  The  anticipated  decrease in 2001
taconite  production is due to high import levels and a softening  economy.  The
majority of the anticipated  10-million ton reduction in taconite production for
2001 is occurring at mines that are not Large Power  Customers.  Two Large Power
Customers have announced  temporary shut downs,  accounting for  approximately 2
million tons of the anticipated decrease. While taconite production is currently
expected to continue at annual levels of about 40 million tons, the  longer-term
outlook of this cyclical  industry is less certain.  We expect any excess energy
not used by our Large Power Customers will be marketed by MPEX and Split Rock.

LARGE  POWER  CUSTOMER  CONTRACTS.  Minnesota  Power  has large  power  customer
contracts with twelve customers (Large Power Customers),  each of which requires
10 MW or more of generating  capacity.  Large Power Customer  contracts  require
Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available.  (See
table on next  page.) In turn,  each Large  Power  Customer is required to pay a
minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs associated with having
this  capacity  available  to serve the  customer,  including a return on common
equity.  Most  contracts  allow  customers to  establish  the level of megawatts
subject to a demand charge on a bi-annual  (power pool season) basis and require
that a portion of their megawatt  needs be comitted on a take-or-pay  basis for
the entire term of the agreement.  In addition to the demand charge,  each Large
Power  Customer  is billed  an energy  charge  for each  kilowatthour  used that
recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity. Six of the Large
Power  Customers have  interruptible  service for a portion of their needs which
provides  a  discounted  demand  rate and  energy  priced at  Minnesota  Power's
incremental cost after serving all firm power obligations.  Minnesota Power also
provides  incremental  production  service for customer  demand levels above the
contract  take-or-pay  levels.  There is no demand  charge for this  service and
energy is priced at an  increment  above  Minnesota  Power's  cost.  Incremental
production  service is  interruptible.  Contracts  with ten of the twelve  Large
Power  Customers  provide for  deferral  without  interest of one-half of demand
charge obligations incurred during the first three months of a strike or illegal
walkout at a customer's  facilities,  with repayment  required over the 12-month
period following resolution of the work stoppage.

Each contract  continues past the contract  termination date unless the required
four-year advance notice of cancellation has been given. Such contracts minimize
the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from  significant  reductions
in kilowatthour  sales to such customers.  Large Power Customers are required to
purchase any electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration
of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity
and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same
regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Regulatory Issues -
Electric Rates.)

PURCHASED POWER AND CAPACITY SALES

A purchase or sale is  generally  made to balance the supply or demand,  thereby
capping the cost of power or fixing a margin.  Minnesota Power's risk management
policy,  contract  provisions,   operational  flexibility,   credit  policy  and
procedures  for  purchasing  power to cap cost or fix  margins  are  designed to
minimize Minnesota Power's risk and exposure in a market with volatile prices.

Minnesota  Power has  contracts  to purchase  capacity  and energy from  various
entities.  The largest  contract is with Square Butte.  Under an agreement  with
Square Butte, expiring at the end of 2026, Minnesota Power is currently entitled
to  approximately  71% of the  output  of a 455-MW  coal-fired  generating  unit
located near Center, North Dakota. (See Note 14.)

Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase  contract with LTV Steel Mining Co. under
which it may purchase approximately 60 MW of capacity from LTV to the extent LTV
does not utilize this  capacity for its own use. LTV has  historically  supplied
its own power requirements  through its own 225 MW generation plant. In December
2000 LTV filed for bankruptcy in a Chapter 11  reorganization  proceeding and in
January 2001 shut down its taconite pellet  operation in Hoyt Lakes,  Minnesota.
LTV was not a Large Power Customer.  Minnesota Power is in discussions  with LTV
concerning existing capacity purchase and interconnection  contracts and ongoing
electric needs.

In October 2000  Minnesota  Power entered into a power  purchase  agreement with
Great River. Under this agreement Minnesota Power will purchase 240 MW from June
2001 to  April  2003  and 80 MW from  May  2003 to  April  2004  from a  natural
gas-fired  Lakefield  Junction  generating plant located in southern  Minnesota.
Excess energy will be marketed by Split Rock.

FUEL

Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River
Basin coal field located in Montana and Wyoming.  Coal  consumption for electric
generation at Minnesota Power's Minnesota coal-fired generating stations in 2000
was about 4 million  tons.  As of December 31, 2000  Minnesota  Power had a coal
inventory  of  about  300,000  tons.  Minnesota  Power  has  three  coal  supply
agreements with Montana  suppliers.  Under these agreements  Minnesota Power has
the tonnage  flexibility to procure 70% to 100% of its total coal  requirements.
Minnesota Power will obtain coal in 2001 under these  agreements and in the spot
market.  This mix of coal supply options allows Minnesota Power to manage market
price and supply risk and to take  advantage  of favorable  spot market  prices.
Minnesota  Power is  exploring  future coal supply  options  and  believes  that
adequate  supplies  of  low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal  will  continue  to be
available.

Burlington  Northern  Santa Fe Railroad  transports  coal by unit train from the
Powder River Basin to Minnesota Power's generating stations. Minnesota Power and
Burlington  Northern  Santa Fe Railroad  have two  long-term  coal  freight-rate
contracts.  One contract  provides for coal deliveries  through 2003 to Boswell.
The other  contract  provides for coal  deliveries  through 2003 to Laskin via a
Duluth Missabe & Iron Range Railway interchange.

The Square Butte  generating  unit operated by Minnkota Power burns North Dakota
lignite  supplied by BNI Coal,  pursuant to the terms of a contract  expiring in
2027.  Square Butte's cost of lignite burned in 2000 was  approximately 63 cents
per MBtu.  The lignite  acreage  that has been  dedicated to Square Butte by BNI
Coal is located on lands  essentially all of which are under private control and
presently  leased by BNI Coal.  This lignite supply is sufficient to provide the
fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating unit.

WHOLESALE ELECTRIC SALES

Minnesota  Power has wholesale  contracts with a number of municipal  customers.
(See  Regulatory  Issues - Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission.)

In an increasingly volatile wholesale  marketplace,  Minnesota Power's wholesale
alliance through Split Rock mitigates marketplace risk while creating additional
marketing  opportunities for both Minnesota Power and Great River. MPEX provides
power trading, energy sourcing and risk management services to Split Rock. Split
Rock's risk management policies are consistent with Minnesota Power's.

In September  1999 Rainy River entered into an amended  15-year  power  purchase
agreement with a subsidiary of LS Power, a privately  owned,  independent  power
producer.   Rainy   River  will  take  the  full   output  of  one  entire  unit
(approximately 275 MW) of a four unit (approximately 1,100 MW) natural gas-fired
combined cycle generation facility located near Chicago, Illinois.  Construction
of the generation  facility began in 2000 with commercial  operation expected in
May 2002.  Minnesota  Power  expects the  agreement  will enhance its ability to
serve an expanding  customer base outside of the MAPP region,  as well as enable
additional  participation in the wholesale bulk power  marketplace.  Rainy River
has entered into a 15-year agreement to resell approximately 50 MW, has a letter
of intent to sell another 50 MW and is engaged in the wholesale marketing of the
remaining  electrical  power.  There  will be a charge  for both  capacity  made
available and energy delivered. Rainy River will be responsible for the purchase
and transportation of natural gas to the facility. Rainy River will be obligated
to pay fixed  capacity  related  charges when  commercial  operation of the unit
occurs.

In June 1999  Minnesota  Power  announced  plans to build a  natural  gas-fired,
combustion  turbine power plant near Superior,  Wisconsin.  Combustion  turbines
produce low emissions and will help alleviate a developing  regional shortage of
electricity  during  periods  of  peak  electrical  demand.   Unavailability  of
combustion  turbines led to a decision to purchase  near-term  peaking  capacity
from Great River's new Lakefield  Junction Project for 2001 to 2004. The project
in Superior is still being  considered  along with a number of other  options to
meet regional needs beyond this time period.

REGULATORY ISSUES

We are exempt from  regulation  under the Public Utility  Holding Company Act of
1935, except as to Section 9(a)(2) which relates to acquisition of securities of
public utility companies.

We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory  authorities.  The MPUC
has  regulatory  authority  over  Minnesota  Power's  service area in Minnesota,
retail rates,  retail  services,  issuance of securities and other matters.  The
FERC  has  jurisdiction  over  the  licensing  of  hydroelectric  projects,  the
establishment  of rates and charges for the sale of  electricity  for resale and
transmission of electricity in interstate  commerce,  and certain accounting and
record  keeping  practices.  The PSCW has  regulatory  authority over the retail
sales of  electricity,  water  and gas by  SWL&P.  The  MPUC,  FERC and PSCW had
regulatory authority over 29%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our 2000 consolidated
operating revenue.

ELECTRIC RATES.  Minnesota Power has historically  designed its electric service
rates based on cost of service  studies under which  allocations are made to the
various classes of customers. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment
clauses which adjust electric  service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and
purchased energy, and recovery of current and deferred CIP expenditures.

In  addition  to  Large  Power  Customer  contracts,  Minnesota  Power  also has
contracts with large industrial and commercial customers with monthly demands of
more than 2 MW but less  than 10 MW of  capacity.  The terms of these  contracts
vary depending  upon the  customer's  demand for power and the cost of extending
Minnesota Power's facilities to provide electric service.

Minnesota  Power requires that all large  industrial  and  commercial  customers
under contract specify the date when power is first required, and thereafter the
customer  is billed for at least the  minimum  power for which they  contracted.
These conditions are part of all contracts  covering power to be supplied to new
large industrial and commercial customers and to current customers as

their  contracts  expire or are amended.  All  contracts  provide that new rates
which  have  been  approved  by  appropriate   regulatory  authorities  will  be
substituted immediately for existing rates, without regard to any unexpired term
of the  existing  contract.  All rate  schedules  and other  contract  terms are
subject to approval by appropriate regulatory authorities.

FEDERAL  ENERGY  REGULATORY  COMMISSION.  The  FERC  has  jurisdiction  over our
wholesale  electric  service and open  access  transmission  service.  Minnesota
Power's hydroelectric  facilities,  which are located in Minnesota, are licensed
by the FERC. (See Environmental Matters - Water.)

Minnesota  Power  has  long-term  contracts  with  16  Minnesota  municipalities
receiving  wholesale  electric  service.  Four contracts are for service through
2002 and 2005,  while the other 12 are for service  through at least  2007.  The
contracts limit rate increases  (including fuel costs) to about 2% per year on a
cumulative  basis.  In 2000  municipal  customers  purchased  703,555  MWh  from
Minnesota Power.

Minnesota Power filed a pro forma open access  transmission  tariff with FERC in
1996, as required.  The tariff governs  Minnesota Power's rates for transmission
and ancillary services to transmission customers.

Issued   in   December   1999   FERC   Order  No.   2000   strongly   encouraged
transmission-owning  utilities  to  participate  in large  independent  regional
transmission  organizations  (RTOs).  The  formation  and  structure of RTOs are
evolving  in the  implementation  of this  federal  policy.  RTOs  will plan and
operate,  and  sometimes  own  regional  transmission  systems.  Members will be
required to turn over  ownership or  operational  control of their  transmission
facilities to the RTO. In  compliance  with FERC Order No. 2000, in October 2000
Minnesota Power filed its intent to join an RTO, indicating a preference for the
Midwest  Independent  System  Operator,  Inc.  (MISO)  while  seeking to resolve
certain  organizational  issues at the  MISO.  Order No.  2000  seeks  voluntary
participation  in an RTO by December 15, 2001.  SWL&P is impacted by a Wisconsin
statute that mandates membership in an RTO.

Minnesota  Power  participates in MAPP, a power pool operating in parts of eight
states in the Upper  Midwest and in three  provinces in Canada.  MAPP  functions
include a regional reliability council that maintains generation reserve sharing
requirements,  a regional  transmission planning group and a wholesale power and
energy market committee.  MAPP enhances  regional electric service  reliability,
provides the opportunity for members to enter into various  economic  wholesale
power  transactions  and  coordinates  the planning and operation of existing as
well as the installation of new generation and transmission facilities. MAPP has
open membership which includes various electric  utilities within the MAPP area,
and marketers and brokers located throughout North America.  MAPP operates under
a 1996 agreement, as amended, and an open access transmission tariff approved by
FERC.  Under this  agreement,  any member who elects to withdraw  from MAPP must
first provide a three-year notice of their intent to do so.

MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.  Minnesota Power's retail rates are based
on a 1994 MPUC  retail  rate  order that  allows  for an 11.6%  return on common
equity dedicated to utility plant.

Minnesota  requires investor owned electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5%
of gross annual retail  electric  revenue on conservation  improvement  programs
(CIP) each year. These investments are recovered from retail customers through a
billing  adjustment and amounts  included in retail base rates.  The MPUC allows
utilities to  accumulate,  in a deferred  account for future  recovery,  all CIP
expenditures as well as a carrying charge on the deferred account balance, which
amount  was $1.1  million  at  December  31,  2000.  During  1999 the  Minnesota
legislature  enacted Minnesota  Power-supported  legislation  allowing customers
with 20 MW or more of connected  load at one service point to opt out of the CIP
minimum spending requirements, and associated expense recovery, upon showing the
MPUC that they had implemented all reasonably available  conservation  measures.
Opt outs were approved in early 2000 for seven of Minnesota  Power's  industrial
customers.  As a result,  the 2000 CIP  investment  goal was $2.7  million  with
actual spending at $1.9 million,  down substantially from the $7.1 million spent
in 1999.  The 2000  spending  shortfall is expected to be made up by  additional
2001 spending.

Until 1999 the MPUC approved  Minnesota Power's request to recover lost margins.
Lost  margins  represent  energy  sales  lost  over a  five-year  period  due to
Minnesota Power's efforts to assist customers in conserving energy.  Lost margin
recovery compensates  utilities for reduced sales resulting from CIP activities.
In 1999 the MPUC denied  Minnesota  Power's  request to recover  $3.5 million of
lost  margins  related to 1998 CIP  activities.  Minnesota  Power  appealed  the
decision to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.  In December 2000 the court reversed
the MPUC's denial of Minnesota  Power's 1998 lost margin claim.  The court found
that the MPUC's action constituted  retroactive ratemaking and was arbitrary and
capricious.  In January  2001 the MPUC  appealed  the  court's  decision  to the
Minnesota Supreme Court. We are unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

PUBLIC  SERVICE  COMMISSION  OF  WISCONSIN.  In  December  1999  SWL&P  filed an
application  with the PSCW for authority to increase  retail utility rates 1.8%.
This average  increase is comprised of a 3.2% decrease in electric rates, a 1.1%
increase in gas rates and a 31%  increase in water  rates.  The  proposed  water
increase is the result of  construction  currently under way to replace an aging
well system.  A final order is expected in March 2001.  SWL&P's  current  retail
rates are based on a 1996 PSCW retail rate order that allows for an 11.6% return
on common equity.

In April 1999 Minnesota  Power and Wisconsin  Public Service  Corporation  (WPS)
announced  plans to construct a 250-mile,  345-kilovolt  transmission  line from
Wausau,  Wisconsin  to  Duluth,   Minnesota.  The  proposal,  called  "Power  Up
Wisconsin," is a direct response to former Wisconsin Governor Thompson's call to
address the pressing need for more  dependable  electricity in Wisconsin and the
Upper Midwest.  Alternative routes for the line using existing rights-of-way are
proposed where feasible.  The Final Environmental Impact Statement was issued in
October 2000 by the PSCW. Hearings in Wisconsin for public input were completed

in December 2000.  Technical hearings are under way and expected to be completed
in early  2001.  The PSCW is  expected  to make a decision  in mid 2001 based on
evidence  introduced at the hearings.  Application for approval of the Minnesota
portion of the line was filed with the  Minnesota  Environmental  Quality  Board
(MEQB) in 1999. The scope of the MEQB hearings was defined as limited to impacts
from construction and operation of the transmission line on human health and the
environment  within  Minnesota.  Minnesota  evidentiary and public hearings were
held in August and September  2000. A  recommendation  for approval was received
from the Administrative Law Judge and the application is expected to be voted on
by the full MEQB in mid 2001.  Depending  on siting  and  regulatory  review and
approval,  the new transmission line could be in service in 2004 at an estimated
cost of between $125 million and $175 million.  Approximately $30 million to $40
million of the estimated  cost is for facilities in Minnesota that will be owned
by Minnesota  Power. The facilities in Wisconsin are being financed and owned by
WPS and may  ultimately  be owned in part by Minnesota  Power (if it exercises a
buy-out option for roughly one half the line), WPS or the American  Transmission
Company RTO in Wisconsin.

In December 2000 the PSCW ordered  SWL&P to apply for  membership in a federally
approved  RTO by  February  1, 2001,  which was  extended  to April 1, 2001.  In
January 2001 SWL&P filed an  application  for  rehearing  and  reopening of this
order. We are unable to predict the outcome of this matter.  (See Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.)

The PSCW must approve the  ownership,  control and  operation of any  affiliated
wholesale  merchant  generating  plants in Wisconsin.  (See  Wholesale  Electric
Sales.)

COMPETITION

INDUSTRY  RESTRUCTURING.  The electric utility industry continues to restructure
in response to growing competition at both the wholesale and retail levels. This
restructuring has primarily affected Minnesota Power's wholesale power marketing
and trading  activity  through Split Rock discussed  above.  New legislation and
regulation to increase  reliability and address wholesale price volatility while
encouraging  competition  at both  the  wholesale  and  retail  levels  is being
considered  at both the federal and state  levels.  Legislative  and  regulatory
activity as well as the actions of  competitors  affect the way Minnesota  Power
strategically plans for its future.

CUSTOMER CHOICE. Twenty-five states representing approximately 70% of the United
States population have passed either  legislation or regulation that initiates a
process which may lead to retail  customer  choice.  In 2001 retail  competition
legislation  will likely again be debated at the federal  level and in Minnesota
and  Wisconsin  though these  initiatives  currently  lack  momentum.  We cannot
predict the timing or substance of any future legislation.

FRANCHISES

Minnesota  Power  holds   franchises  to  construct  and  maintain  an  electric
distribution and  transmission  system in 84 cities and towns located within its
electric service territory. SWL&P holds franchises in 15 cities and towns within
its service  territory.  The remaining  cities and towns served do not require a
franchise to operate within their boundaries.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Certain  businesses  included  in our Energy  Services  segment  are  subject to
regulation by various federal,  state and local  authorities  about air quality,
water quality,  solid wastes and other environmental  matters. We consider these
businesses to be in substantial compliance with those environmental  regulations
currently  applicable to their  operations and believe all necessary  permits to
conduct such operations have been obtained.  We do not currently anticipate that
potential  capital  expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be material.
However, because environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the
character,  scope  and  ultimate  costs of  environmental  compliance  cannot be
estimated.

AIR. Minnesota Power's generating facilities in Minnesota burn mainly low-sulfur
western coal and Square Butte,  located in North Dakota, burns lignite coal. All
of these  facilities  are equipped  with  pollution  control  equipment  such as
scrubbers,  baghouses or electrostatic precipitators.  The federal Clean Air Act
Amendments  of 1990  (Clean  Air Act)  created  emission  allowances  for sulfur
dioxide.  Each allowance is an  authorization to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide,
and each utility must have sufficient  allowances to cover its annual emissions.
Sulfur dioxide emission requirements are currently being met by all of Minnesota
Power's  generating  facilities,  creating  a surplus  allowance  situation  for
Minnesota   Power.   Square  Butte   anticipates   meeting  its  sulfur  dioxide
requirements  through  increased  use of  existing  scrubbers  and  by  annually
purchasing additional allowances as necessary.

In accordance  with the Clean Air Act, the EPA has  established  nitrogen  oxide
limitations for electric  generating units. To meet nitrogen oxide  limitations,
Minnesota Power installed advanced low emission burner technology and associated
control  equipment to operate the Boswell and Laskin  facilities at or below the
compliance emission limits. Nitrogen oxide limitations at Square Butte are being
met by combustion tuning. Minnesota Power has obtained all necessary Title V air
operating permits from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for its applicable
facilities to conduct electric operations.

In December 2000 the EPA announced their decision to regulate mercury  emissions
from coal and oil fired  power  plants  under  Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.
Section 112 will require all such power plants in the United States to adhere to
the EPA maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for mercury.  The
EPA's  announcements  clarified that the EPA will establish  applicable  mercury
MACT standards through a four-year rule making and public comment period, giving
consideration  to factors such as a facility's  installed  design and operation.
Final regulations  defining control  requirements are planned for December 2004.
Cost estimates are premature at this time.

In December 2000 Minnesota  Power received a request from the EPA, under Section
114 of the Clean Air Act, seeking information  regarding capital expenditures at
all  of  its  coal-fired  generating  stations.   This  action  is  part  of  an
industry-wide  investigation assessing compliance with the New Source Review and
the New Source Performance  Standards (emissions standards that apply to new and
changed  units) of the Clean Air Act at  electric  generating  stations.  We are
unable to predict  whether any  further  action will be taken by the EPA on this
matter or  whether  Minnesota  Power  will be  required  to incur any costs as a
result.

WATER.  The Federal Water Pollution  Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA),  as amended by
the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987,  established  the
National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System (NPDES) permit program.  The
FWPCA  requires  NPDES permits to be obtained from the EPA (or, when  delegated,
from individual state pollution control agencies) for any wastewater  discharged
into navigable waters. Minnesota Power has obtained all necessary NPDES permits,
including NPDES storm water permits for applicable facilities,  to conduct their
electric operations.

Minnesota  Power holds FERC licenses  authorizing the ownership and operation of
seven  hydroelectric  generating  projects with a total  generating  capacity of
about 118 MW. In June 1996  Minnesota  Power filed in the U.S.  Court of Appeals
for the  District  of Columbia  Circuit a petition  for review of the license as
issued by the FERC for  Minnesota  Power's  St.  Louis River  project.  Separate
petitions for review were also filed by the U.S.  Department of the Interior and
the  Fond  du Lac  Band  of Lake  Superior  Chippewa  (Fond  du Lac  Band),  two
intervenors  in the  licensing  proceedings.  The court  consolidated  the three
petitions for review and suspended the briefing  schedule while  Minnesota Power
and the Fond du Lac Band negotiate the reasonable fee for use of tribal lands as
mandated  by the new  license.  Both  parties  informed  the  court  that  these
negotiations may resolve other disputed issues, and they are obligated to report
to the court  periodically the status of these  discussions.  Beginning in 1996,
and most recently in January 2001,  Minnesota Power filed requests with the FERC
for extensions of time to comply with certain plans and studies  required by the
license that might conflict with the settlement discussions.

SOLID AND HAZARDOUS  WASTE.  The Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976
regulates  the  management  and  disposal of solid  wastes.  As a result of this
legislation,  the EPA has promulgated  various hazardous waste rules.  Minnesota
Power is required to notify the EPA of hazardous  waste  activity and  routinely
submits the necessary annual reports to the EPA.

In response to EPA Region V's request for utilities to  participate in the Great
Lakes  Initiative by voluntarily  removing  remaining  polychlorinated  biphenyl
(PCB) inventories, Minnesota Power has scheduled replacement of PCB-contaminated
oil by 2004.  The total cost is  expected  to be  between  $2.5  million  and $3
million,  of which $1.1 million was spent  through  December 31, 2000.  [GRAPHIC

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

Automotive Services includes several subsidiaries that are integral parts of the
vehicle redistribution business.  Vehicle sales within the auto auction industry
are expected to rise at a rate of 2% to 4% annually over the next several years.
With the  continued  increased  popularity  of leasing  and the high cost of new
vehicles, a steady flow of vehicles is expected to return to auction. Automotive
Services plans to grow through increased sales at existing businesses, selective
acquisitions  and expansion of its services to customers.  The discussion  below
summarizes the major businesses we include in Automotive  Services.  Statistical
information is presented as of the date of this Form 10-K. All  subsidiaries are
wholly owned unless otherwise specifically indicated.

ADESA  is  the  second  largest   vehicle  auction  network  in  North  America.
Headquartered in Indianapolis,  Indiana,  ADESA owns (or leases) and operates 54
vehicle  auction  facilities in the United States and Canada  through which used
cars and other vehicles are sold to franchised  automobile  dealers and licensed
used car dealers.  Sellers at ADESA's auctions include domestic and foreign auto
manufacturers,  car dealers, automotive fleet/lease companies, banks and finance
companies.  ADESA also has 19 auction facilities in the United States and Canada
that provide  "total loss"  vehicle  recovery  services to insurance  companies.
During  2000 ADESA  acquired  or opened 28 new vehicle  auction  facilities  and
purchased the remaining 53% of Canada's largest provider of "total loss" vehicle
recovery services.

Also in 2000 ADESA  Importation  Services,  Inc.  purchased all of the assets of
International  Vehicle  Importers,  Inc., a United States  registered  importer.
ADESA  Importation  is  headquartered  in Flint,  Michigan  with  facilities  in
Buffalo,  New York; Grand Forks, North Dakota;  Sweetgrass,  Montana and Blaine,
Washington.  ADESA  Importation  is the second  largest  independent  commercial
registered importer of vehicles in the United States.

In  January  2001  ALLETE and ADESA  acquired  all of the  outstanding  stock of
ComSearch,  Inc. and purchased the assets of Auto Placement Center,  Inc. (APC),
in an overall  transaction  valued at $62.4 million.  APC provides  "total loss"
vehicle  recovery  services at eight auction  facilities  in the United  States.
ComSearch provides  Internet-based parts location and insurance adjustment audit
services nationwide. Both APC and ComSearch are based in Rhode Island.

The table on the next page lists the vehicle auctions  currently owned or leased
by ADESA. Each auction has a multi-lane, drive-through auction facility, as well
as additional  buildings for  reconditioning,  registration,  maintenance,  body
work, and other  ancillary and  administrative  services.  Each auction also has
secure parking areas to store vehicles for auction. All vehicle auction property
owned by ADESA is subject to liens securing various notes payable.

AFC provides inventory financing for wholesale and retail automobile dealers who
purchase  vehicles  from ADESA  auctions,  independent  auctions,  other auction
chains and outside sources.  AFC is  headquartered in Indianapolis,  Indiana and
has 86 loan  production  offices at or near auto auctions  across North America.
These offices provide  qualified  dealers credit to purchase  vehicles at any of
the 400 plus  auctions  approved by AFC. In October  2000 AFC  launched  its new
computer  application  system,  COSMOS (an acronym for computer operating system
managing our success).  COSMOS, an Oracle-based  system,  follows each loan from
origination  to payoff  and  allows AFC to better  manage  its  business,  while
expediting  services  through its branch network to more than 15,000  registered
dealers.

services include vehicle condition reporting,  inventory  verification auditing,

verification is still the core of AutoVIN's  business,  its growth  potential is
increased by providing inspection services for other products.

COMPETITION

Within  the  automobile   auction   industry,   ADESA's   competition   includes
independently  owned  auctions  as well as a major chain and  associations  with
auctions in geographic proximity. ADESA competes with these other auctions for a
supply of vehicles to be sold on consignment for automobile  dealers,  financial
institutions  and other  sellers.  ADESA  also  competes  for a supply of rental
repurchase vehicles from automobile  manufacturers for auction at factory sales.
Automobile  manufacturers often choose between auctions across multi-state areas
in distributing rental repurchase  vehicles.  ADESA competes for these customers
by attempting to attract a large number of dealers to purchase  vehicles,  which
ensures competitive prices and supports the volume of vehicles auctioned.  ADESA
also competes by providing a full range of automotive services, including dealer
inventory financing,  reconditioning services that prepare vehicles for auction,
transportation of vehicles and processing of sales transactions.

ADESA utilizes e-commerce as another component in its array of services. Dealers
are provided training on how to use on-line products,  including the purchase of
vehicles on-line.  The dealers can also access auction runlists and other market
report information offered on ADESA's website, www.ADESA.com.  ADESA believes it
has a competitive  advantage in a small but growing  segment of the used vehicle
market  combining  on-line  services with auction  facilities and  knowledgeable
auction personnel located across North America.

AFC is the  largest  provider  of  dealer  floorplan  financing  to  independent
automobile dealers in North America.  AFC's competition includes other specialty
lenders,  banks and other financial  institutions.  AFC has distinguished itself
from its competitors by convenience of payment,  quality of service and scope of
services offered. In addition to its floorplan services,  AFC, through alliances
with other  experienced  vendors,  has  expanded  its  service  array to include
sub-prime  financing,  physical  damage  insurance and warranty  products to its
dealer base. These alliances make AFC a one-stop shopping provider.

PAR provides customized remarketing services throughout North America.  Although
other providers are larger in size and volume,  PAR's  competition  comes from a
handful  of  similar  service  providers,  none of which  offer as many  diverse
services  as it does.  In June  2000 PAR  introduced  its  interactive  website,
electronically  connecting  customers  with its services.  Further  enhancements
scheduled  for  availability  in the first  quarter of 2001 include  interactive
connection  with  repossession   agents  and  auction  vendor  networks.   PAR's
affiliation with EndTrust gives it a competitive edge in gaining market share in
the lease-end  management  services arena.  Another area that  distinguishes PAR
from its competition is ADESA Importation.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Certain businesses in our Automotive  Services segment are subject to regulation
by various federal,  state and local authorities  concerning air quality,  water
quality,  solid  wastes  and other  environmental  matters.  We  consider  these
businesses to be in substantial compliance with those environmental  regulations
currently  applicable to their  operations and believe all necessary  permits to
conduct such operations have been obtained.  We do not currently anticipate that
potential  capital  expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be material.
However, because environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the
character,  scope  and  ultimate  costs of  environmental  compliance  cannot be
estimated. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

WATER SERVICES

Our Water Services segment consists of regulated and non-regulated  wholly owned
subsidiaries.  Non-regulated  subsidiaries  market our water  expertise  outside
traditional  utility  boundaries.  The  discussion  below  summarizes  the major
businesses we include in Water Services. Statistical information is presented as
of December 31, 2000.

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. FLORIDA WATER, the largest investor owned water supplier
in Florida,  owns and operates water and wastewater  treatment facilities within
that state.  Florida Water serves 152,000 water customers and 73,000  wastewater
customers, and maintains 157 water and wastewater facilities with plants ranging
in size from 6  connections  to greater than 25,000  connections.  Florida Water
provides  customers  with over 19 billion  gallons of water per year,  primarily
from  Florida's  underground  aquifer.  Substantially  all  of  Florida  Water's
properties used in water and wastewater operations are encumbered by a mortgage.
During 2000  Florida  Water  purchased  the assets of Spruce  Creek which serves
5,600 water and  wastewater  customers in three  communities  in Marion  County,
Florida.  The systems  acquired  are designed to  accommodate  a total of 10,000
water and  wastewater  customers.  In December 2000 Florida Water also purchased
the assets of Steeplechase  Utility  Company,  Inc. which serves 1,200 water and
wastewater  customers  in Marion  County,  Florida.  The system is  designed  to
accommodate a total of 3,200 water and wastewater customers.

HEATER  provides  water and  wastewater  treatment  services in North  Carolina.
Heater serves 44,000 water customers and 5,000 wastewater customers.  Heater has
water and wastewater  systems  located in subdivisions  surrounding  Raleigh and
Fayetteville,  North  Carolina,  and the Piedmont and Mountain  regions of North
Carolina.  Water  supply is primarily  from ground  water deep wells.  Community
ground water systems vary in size from 25 connections to 6,000 connections. Some
systems  are  supplied  by  purchased  water.   Heater  has   approximately  415
interconnected  and  stand-alone  systems  and 972  wells.  Heater  also  has 33
wastewater  treatment  plants,  ranging in size from  10,000  gallons per day to
670,000  gallons  per  day,  and 79  lift  stations  located  in its  wastewater
collection  systems.  Substantially all of Heater's properties used in its water
and  wastewater  operations  are  encumbered  by a mortgage.  During 2000 Heater
acquired the assets of several  small water and  wastewater  systems which added
approximately 1,100 customers.

NON-REGULATED  SUBSIDIARIES.  AMERICAS'  WATER was  incorporated in 1997 and has
offices in Grand Rapids,  Michigan,  Plymouth,  Wisconsin and Orlando,  Florida.
Americas' Water offers contract management,  operations and maintenance services
for water and wastewater  treatment  facilities to governments  and  industries.
Americas' Water provides services in Minnesota,  Michigan,  Wisconsin,  Ohio and
Florida.

INSTRUMENTATION    SERVICES,    INC.   provides   predictive   maintenance   and
instrumentation  consulting services to water and wastewater utilities and other
industrial  operations  throughout the southeastern part of the United States as
well as Texas and Minnesota.

GEORGIA WATER  SERVICES  CORPORATION  was  established in 2000. In December 2000
ALLETE Water Services, Inc. purchased, subject to certain conditions, the assets
of Dicks Creek  Wastewater  Utility for $6.6 million plus a commitment  to pay a
fee for residential connections. Beginning in 2001, the commitment fee will be a
minimum of $400,000  annually for four years or until the  cumulative  fees paid
reach $2 million.  Dicks Creek, which is located near Atlanta in Forsyth County,
Georgia,  will be operated by Georgia Water.  The  transaction is expected to be
completed in early 2001.

REGULATORY ISSUES

FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE  COMMISSION.  In 1995 the Florida First District Court of
Appeals (Court of Appeals) reversed a 1993 FPSC order establishing uniform rates
for most of Florida Water's service areas. With "uniform rates" all customers in
each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and wastewater services.  In
response to the Court of Appeals' order, in August 1996 the FPSC ordered Florida
Water to issue refunds to those customers who paid more since October 1993 under
uniform rates than they would have paid under stand-alone  rates. This order did
not permit a balancing surcharge to customers who paid less under uniform rates.
Florida  Water  appealed,  and the Court of Appeals  ruled in June 1997 that the
FPSC could not order refunds without  balancing  surcharges.  In response to the
Court of Appeals' ruling,  the FPSC issued an order in January 1998 that did not
require  refunds.  Florida Water's  potential  refund liability at that time was
about $12.5 million,  which included interest,  to customers who paid more under
uniform rates.

In the same January 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund,  with
interest,  $2.5 million, the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service
area from January 1996 through June 1997 under  uniform  rates that exceeded the
amount  these  customers  would  have paid  under a  modified  stand-alone  rate
structure.  No balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund
because  Spring  Hill  customers  continued  to pay  uniform  rates  after other
customers  began  paying  modified  stand-alone  rates  effective  January  1996
pursuant to the FPSC's interim rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case. The
FPSC did not include  Spring Hill in this  interim rate order  because  Hernando
County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida
Water  reached an agreement  with  Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to
stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups that paid more under uniform rates  appealed the FPSC's January
1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund  because the FPSC had no
authority to order uniform  rates.  Florida Water also appealed the $2.5 million
refund order. Initial briefs were filed by all parties in May 1998. In June 1998
the Court of Appeals  reversed  its  previous  ruling  that the FPSC was without
authority to order uniform rates at which time customer  groups  supporting  the
FPSC's  January  1998 order  filed a motion  with the Court of  Appeals  seeking
dismissal of the appeal by customer groups seeking  refunds.  Customers  seeking
refunds filed amended  briefs in September  1998. A provision for refund related
to the $2.5 million refund order was recorded in 1999.

In December 2000 Hernando County approved a settlement agreement relating to the
Spring  Hill  refund  issue  that was  before  the Court of  Appeals.  Under the
settlement  agreement,  Spring Hill customers  would receive a prospective  rate
reduction over three years totaling $1.8 million with no refunds.  Florida Water
also  agreed  it would  not file a rate case to  increase  rates to Spring  Hill
customers  for a period of three  years.  In December  2000 the Court of Appeals
remanded the issue back to the FPSC for settlement consideration.  We are unable
to predict the timing or outcome of the appeal and settlement process.

NORTH  CAROLINA  UTILITIES  COMMISSION.  In October 2000 the NCUC issued a final
order  approving a $2.2  million,  or 18%,  annual rate  increase  for water and
wastewater customers of Heater.  Heater had requested an annual rate increase of
$3.3 million, or 26%, for its water and waste water customers.

COMPETITION

Water Services provides water and wastewater  services at regulated rates within
exclusive service  territories  granted by regulators.  Significant  competition
exists for the provision of the types of services  provided by Americas'  Water.
Although a few private  contractors control a large percentage of the market for
contract  management,  operations  and  maintenance  services,  we believe  that
continued growth in these markets will enable emerging  companies like Americas'
Water to succeed.

FRANCHISES

Florida Water provides water and  wastewater  treatment  services in 21 counties
regulated by the FPSC and holds  franchises  in 5 counties  which have  retained
authority to regulate such operations.  (See Regulatory  Issues - Florida Public
Service  Commission.) Water and wastewater services provided by Heater are under
the  jurisdiction of the NCUC. The NCUC grants  franchises for Heater's  service
territory when the rates are authorized.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Our Water Services are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local
authorities  concerning  water  quality,  solid  wastes and other  environmental
matters.  We consider these  businesses to generally be in compliance with those
environmental  regulations currently applicable to their operations and have the
permits  necessary to conduct such  operations.  We do not currently  anticipate
that potential capital expenditures for environmental  matters will be material.
However, because environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the
character,  scope  and  ultimate  costs of  environmental  compliance  cannot be
estimated. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

INVESTMENTS

Our  Investments  segment  consists of real estate  operations,  investments  in
emerging  technologies  related to the electric utility industry and an actively
traded  securities   portfolio.   The  discussion  below  summarizes  the  major
components of Investments.  Statistical  information is presented as of December
31,  2000.  All  subsidiaries  are wholly owned  unless  otherwise  specifically
indicated.

REAL ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Our real estate operations include CAPE CORAL HOLDINGS
and an 80% ownership in LEHIGH. Through subsidiaries, we own Florida real estate
operations in four different locations:

     -   Lehigh Acres with 1,000 acres of land and approximately 700 home sites
         adjacent to Fort Myers, Florida;

     -   Sugarmill Woods with 530 home sites in Citrus County, Florida;

     -   Palm Coast with 1,950 home sites and 9,300 acres of residential,
         commercial and industrial land at Palm Coast,  Florida. Palm Coast is a
         planned community between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach; and

     -   Cape  Coral,  also  located  adjacent  to  Fort  Myers,  Florida,  with
         approximately  1,000 acres of commercial  and  residential  zoned land,
         including home sites, marina and commercial buildings.

The real estate strategy is to continue to acquire large properties at low cost,
add value and sell them at going market prices.

EMERGING  TECHNOLOGY  INVESTMENTS.  Since 1985 we have invested $38.6 million in
start-up companies that are developing  technologies that may be utilized by the
electric  utility  industry.  We are  comitted  to invest an  additional  $13.3
million  through  2008.  The  investments   were  first  made  through  emerging
technology funds initiated by us and other electric utilities. More recently, we
have made investments directly in privately held companies.  The majority of our
direct investments relate to distributed  generation  technology,  such as micro
generation and fuel cell technology.

The emerging  technology  funds (Funds) have made  investments in companies that
develop  advanced  technologies  to be used by the utility  industry,  including
electrotechnologies   and  renewable   energy   technologies  and  software  and
communications   technologies  related  to  utility  customer  support  systems.
Customer support systems include customer information systems, energy management
systems, Internet marketing, broadband communications and power quality.

PROTON ENERGY SYSTEMS,  INC. develops and manufactures  proton exchange membrane
products  for use in  hydrogen  generating  devices and  regenerative  fuel cell
systems  that  function  as power  generating  and energy  storage  devices.  In
addition to our direct investment, the Funds are also invested in Proton.

METALLIC  POWER,  INC. is engaged in the development  and  commercialization  of
zinc/air fuel cells to be used in place of battery operated and small combustion
engines (i.e.,  forklifts,  golf carts, lawn mowers and portable  generation for
mobile applications).  Metallic is privately held and located in California.  In
addition to our direct investment, the Funds are also invested in Metallic.

ENPORION,  INC.  is  a  start-up  business-to-business   electronic  marketplace
focusing on the supply chain of energy  utilities.  Enporion was founded in 2000
by seven  electric and gas utilities,  including us. The electronic  marketplace
began  transacting  business  in the  fourth  quarter  of 2000.  Our $3  million
investment represents a 12.5% ownership interest.

As companies  included in our emerging  technology  investments are sold, we may
recognize a gain or loss.  In the second half of 2000,  several of the companies
included in the Funds completed an initial public offering. Typically, investors
are not  permitted  to sell  stock of the  companies  for a  period  of 180 days
following an initial public offering. Other restrictions on sale may also apply.
Since  going  public,  the  market  value of  these  companies  has  experienced
significant  volatility.  Our  investment in the companies that have gone public
has a cost basis of  approximately  $13 million.  The aggregate  market value of
these companies at December 31, 2000 was $52 million.

Our  emerging  technology  investments  provide  us with  access  to  developing
technologies  before their  commercial  debut, as well as financial  returns and
diversification opportunities.  We view these investments as a source of capital
for  redeployment in existing  businesses and a potential entree into additional
business  opportunities.  Portions of any proceeds received on these investments
may be  reinvested  back  into  companies  to  encourage  development  of future
technology.

SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO.  Our securities  portfolio is managed by selected outside
managers as well as internal managers. It is intended to provide stable earnings
and  liquidity.  Proceeds  from  the  securities  portfolio  are  available  for
investment in existing businesses,  to fund strategic  initiatives and for other
corporate purposes.  Our investment in the securities  portfolio at December 31,
2000 was $91 million ($257 million at December 31, 1999).

In May 2000 we sold 4.7 million  shares of ACE common  stock that we received in
exchange for 7.3 million shares of Capital Re common stock in December 1999. The
exchange of stock was the result of a merger in which each  Capital Re share was
exchanged for 0.65  ordinary  shares of ACE plus $3.4456 in cash. At the time of
the  merger we owned 20% of  Capital Re which  converted  to 2% of ACE.  The ACE
shares were included in our securities portfolio at December 31, 1999.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Certain businesses included in our Investments segment are subject to regulation
by various federal,  state and local authorities  concerning air quality,  water
quality,  solid  wastes  and other  environmental  matters.  We  consider  these
businesses to be in substantial compliance with those environmental  regulations
currently  applicable to their  operations and believe all necessary  permits to
conduct such operations have been obtained.  We do not currently anticipate that
potential  capital  expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be material.
However, because environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the
character,  scope  and  ultimate  costs of  environmental  compliance  cannot be
estimated. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

ITEM 5.   MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
          MATTERS

We have paid dividends  without  interruption  on our common stock since 1948. A
quarterly  dividend  of $0.2675  per share on our  common  stock will be paid on
March 1, 2001 to the holders of record on February 15, 2001. Our common stock is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange  under the symbol ALE.  Dividends paid per
share,  and the  high  and low  prices  for our  common  stock  for the  periods
indicated as reported by THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,  Midwest  Edition,  are in the
accompanying chart.

On March 2, 1999 our common  stock was split  two-for-one.  All common share and
per share amounts have been adjusted for all periods to reflect the  two-for-one
stock split.

The amount and timing of  dividends  payable on our common  stock are within the
sole  discretion  of our  Board  of  Directors.  In 2000 we  paid  out 51%  (64%
excluding the gain related to the ACE  transaction) of our per share earnings in
dividends.

Our Articles of Incorporation, and Mortgage and Deed of Trust contain provisions
which under  certain  circumstances  would  restrict the payment of common stock
dividends.  As of December 31, 2000 no retained  earnings  were  restricted as a
result of these provisions.  At January 29, 2001 there were approximately 38,000
common stock shareholders of record. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

</TABLE>

We achieved strong earnings growth as 2000 net income,  exclusive of the Capital
Re and ACE  transactions  (see net  income  discussion  for  Capital  Re and ACE
transactions on the next page),  increased  $14.0 million,  or 13%, and earnings
per share  increased  $0.18,  or 12%,  over 1999.  Much of the growth  came from
Automotive  Services,  as net  income  from  that  segment  in 2000  was up $8.6
million,  or 22%, over 1999.  Although a cooler summer in 2000 resulted in lower
net income from Energy  Services,  financial  results for all business  segments
reflected  ongoing  operational   improvements  and  the  successful  strategies
initiated to grow and diversify each business.

We  measure   performance  of  our  operations  through  careful  budgeting  and
monitoring of contributions by each business segment to consolidated net income.
Corporate Charges represent general corporate expenses,  including interest, not
specifically related to any one business segment.

The following  summarizes  significant events which impacted net income for each
of our business segments for the past three years.

ENERGY  SERVICES' net income in 2000 declined $1.9 million,  or 4%, from 1999 as
strong  megawatthour  sales were more than offset by lower  margins on wholesale
power marketing  activities.  Megawatthour sales increased 4% to 11.7 million in
2000 (11.3 million in 1999;  12 million in 1998)  primarily due to more sales to
large industrial customers.  Lower demand in the region's wholesale power market
as a result of more  moderate  summer  weather led to the  decrease in wholesale
margins in 2000. In 1999 Energy Services  reflected lower  megawatthour sales to
industrial   customers  and  higher  margins  from  wholesale   power  marketing
activities,  a denial  of lost  margin  recovery  for  conservation  improvement
programs  and a  one-time  property  tax  levy  associated  with  an  industrial
development  project.  The 1999 decline in sales was primarily  attributable  to
fewer sales to taconite,  paper and pipeline  customers  because of lower demand
for domestic steel, stronger competition in the paper markets and lower pipeline
pumping levels. In 1998 net income reflected higher margins from wholesale power
marketing activities.  An unusually mild winter in 1998 negatively impacted both
net income and megawatthour sales to retail customers.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES  continued its strong growth,  as 2000 net income increased
$8.6 million,  or 22%, over 1999. The growth was due to increased sales activity
at ADESA  auction  facilities  and  increased  financing  activity at AFC's loan
production offices.  ADESA added 28 new auction facilities in 2000 (two in 1999;
three in 1998) and  completed  the  acquisition  of 11 auction  facilities  that
provide "total loss" vehicle recovery services to insurance companies.  At ADESA
auction  facilities 1.3 million vehicles were sold in 2000 (1.0 million in 1999;
0.9 million in 1998).  Same store growth at ADESA auction  facilities  increased
12% as measured by earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation,  amortization
and  lease  expense.  AFC  contributed  48% of the net  income  from  Automotive
Services in 2000. AFC had 86 loan production  offices in 2000 (84 in 1999; 84 in
1998). The growth of AFC's dealer/customer base from 11,500 in 1998 to 15,000 in
2000 has enabled AFC to finance more vehicles, 795,000 vehicles in 2000 (695,000
in 1999; 531,000 in 1998). In 1999 Automotive Services showed significant growth
reflecting a profitable mix of same-store  growth and selective  acquisitions at
ADESA  as  well  as  increased  financing  activity  and  the  maturing  of loan
production  offices  that were  opened in 1998 by AFC. In 1998 AFC added 30 loan
production offices.

WATER SERVICES' net income in 2000 was up $0.9 million,  or 7%, compared to 1999
due to increased water  consumption as a result of drier weather  conditions and
customer growth,  regulatory relief granted by Florida's  Hillsborough  Board of
County Commissioners

in 2000 and higher rates  approved by the FPSC in 1999.  In 1999 Water  Services
generated  higher net income due to strategic  acquisitions  and customer growth
that increased the customer base by 24%,  regulatory  relief granted by the FPSC
in the  settlement  of  Florida  Water's  1995 rate case and  increased  average
consumption.  In  1998  Water  Services  results  reflected  regulatory  relief,
customer growth, increased consumption and operating efficiencies.

INVESTMENTS'  net income in 2000 was $2.5 million,  or 9%, more than 1999 due to
record sales by our real estate operations.  While the balance of our securities
portfolio was reduced to fund significant  acquisitions by Automotive  Services,
improved  returns  on our  investments  contributed  to higher net  income.  Our
securities portfolio earned an annualized after-tax return of 7.0% in 2000 (3.3%
in 1999;  5.5% in 1998).  In 1999  Investments  reported  gains from an emerging
technology investment and lower returns on our securities portfolio due to stock
market  volatility.  In 1998 Investments  reported a lower after-tax return from
our securities  portfolio due to the under  performance of certain  investments,
which  was  offset by  dividend  income  received  from an  emerging  technology
investment and strong sales by our real estate operations.

CORPORATE  CHARGES in 2000 were $3.9 million,  or 20%, less than 1999 due to the
resolution of various federal and state tax issues and less preferred  dividends
because of  redemption.  Corporate  Charges in 1999 reflected  reduced  interest
expense  as a result of a lower  average  commercial  paper  balance.  Corporate
Charges in 1998 included  reduced  interest  expense due to the  availability of
cash from the sale of common stock  offset by higher  expenses  associated  with
benefit incentives, a change in accounting for start-up costs, and technological
and communication improvements made to corporate-wide systems.

CAPITAL RE AND ACE  TRANSACTIONS.  In May 2000 we recorded a $30.4  million,  or
$0.44 per share, after-tax gain on the sale of 4.7 million shares of ACE that we
received  in December  1999 when  Capital Re merged with ACE. As a result of the
merger,  in 1999 we  recorded a $36.2  million,  or $0.52 per  share,  after-tax
non-cash charge as follows: a $24.1 million,  or $0.35 per share,  charge in the
second quarter  following the merger agreement and  discontinuance of our equity
accounting  for Capital Re; and a $12.1 million,  or $0.17 per share,  charge in
the fourth quarter upon completion of the merger.

2000 COMPARED TO 1999

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES' operating revenue was up $35.0 million, or 6%, in 2000 due to a
6% increase in retail  megawatthour  sales  because of higher  demand from large
industrial  customers.  This increase was  partially  offset by fewer sales from
wholesale power  marketing  activities.  Wholesale  prices and volumes were down
from 1999 because of lower  demand for  electricity  in the  region's  wholesale
power  market as a result  of more  moderate  summer  weather  and  transmission
constraints.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES'  operating revenue was up $139.8 million,  or 34%, in 2000
primarily  due  to a  27%  increase  in  vehicles  sold  through  ADESA  auction
facilities  and a 14%  increase in the number of vehicles  financed by AFC.  The
increase in vehicles sold was primarily attributable to new auctions acquired or
opened in 1999 and 2000.  Financial  results  for 2000  included  a full year of
operations  for  auction  facilities  acquired  in 1999  and a  partial  year of
operations for auction facilities acquired or opened in 2000.

WATER SERVICES' operating revenue was up $5.7 million, or 5%, in 2000 because of
a 12% increase in water consumption.  Drier weather conditions,  customer growth
and the  inclusion  of water  systems  acquired  during  1999 and early 2000 all
influenced the increase in water consumption.  In addition,  revenue in 2000 was
$1.0 million higher due to regulatory  relief granted by Florida's  Hillsborough
Board of County  Commissioners  in 2000 and $0.8  million  higher  due to higher
rates approved by the FPSC in 1999. Revenue in 1999 reflected the recognition of
$2.7 million of regulatory relief granted by the FPSC.

INVESTMENTS'   operating  revenue  was  up  $19.6  million,  or  34%,  in  2000.
Significant  sales by our real estate operations were the primary reason for the
increase.  In 2000 seven large sales  contributed $31.9 million to revenue while
in 1999 five large sales contributed  $17.1 million to revenue.  Despite a lower
average balance in 2000, income from our securities  portfolio was higher due to
improved  returns.  Income from our  emerging  technology  investments  was $4.6
million lower in 2000 because in 1999 we reported gains received from one of our
emerging technology investments.

OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY  SERVICES'  operating  expenses  were up $37.0  million,  or 8%,  in 2000
primarily due to increased fuel and purchased power  expenses.  Fuel expense was
$5.7 million higher in 2000 because we paid higher prices for coal and generated
247,000,  or 4%,  more  megawatthours  to meet the  higher  requirements  of our
industrial  customers.  In 2000  purchased  power  expense was up $23.1  million
because of higher prices.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES' operating expenses were up $127.0 million, or 38%, in 2000
primarily due to the  inclusion of new vehicle  auction  facilities  acquired or
opened in 1999 and 2000.  Increased sales activity at the auction facilities and
increased financing activity at AFC also increased operating expenses in 2000.

WATER SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $3.4 million,  or 4%, in 2000 due to
the inclusion of water systems acquired in 1999 and 2000.

INVESTMENTS' operating expenses were up $8.8 million, or 37%, in 2000 due to the
cost of property sold by our real estate operations.

1999 COMPARED TO 1998

OPERATING REVENUE

ENERGY SERVICES' operating revenue was down $5.3 million, less than 1%, in 1999.
Revenue  in 1999  reflected  a  $23.0  million  increase  from  wholesale  power
marketing  activities  because of extreme  weather  conditions  affecting  power
market  prices  during the third  quarter of 1999.  Temperatures,  which were at
record highs during the last week of July 1999,  created a high demand for power
from  other  power  suppliers.   Revenue  from  industrial  customers  was  down
approximately $19 million in 1999 due to decreased  taconite  production,  paper
manufacturing  and pipeline  usage.  Revenue  from  residential  and  commercial
customers was $3.8 million higher in 1999 because the winter weather in northern
Minnesota and  Wisconsin  was colder than 1998 and July 1999 was unusually  hot.
Revenue in 1998  included  $3.8 million of CIP lost margin  recovery.  Minnesota
Power  was  denied  CIP lost  margin  recovery  in 1999.  (See  Item 1. - Energy
Services - Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.)

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES' operating revenue was up $78.2 million, or 24%, in 1999 due
to stronger sales at ADESA auction facilities,  and increased financing activity
and 12 months of operations at loan production offices opened in 1998 by AFC. At
ADESA auction  facilities  16% more vehicles were sold in 1999 compared to 1998.
In 1999 ADESA auction  financial  results  included 12 months of operations from
three vehicle auctions acquired in 1998 and partial year results for two vehicle
auction  facilities  acquired in 1999.  AFC financed  31% more  vehicles in 1999
compared to 1998. AFC has had 84 loan  production  offices since August 1998, 30
of which were opened during 1998.

WATER SERVICES'  operating  revenue was up $17.3 million,  or 18%, in 1999, with
$12.3 million of the increase  coming from PCUC,  which was purchased in January
1999. The remainder of the increase was attributed to regulatory  relief granted
by the FPSC in December 1998 and September  1999,  the  acquisition of Mid South
and more consumption due to customer growth.  Overall consumption  increased 12%
in 1999.  In 1998 overall  consumption  was lower than normal due to some of our
water  systems  being  adversely  impacted by record  rainfall  during the first
quarter. Gains totaling $600,000 from the sale of a water system and the sale of
land were included in 1998 revenue.

INVESTMENTS' operating revenue was up $2.3 million, or 4%, in 1999 primarily due
to $10.7 million in gains from an investment in an emerging  technology fund and
higher  sales by our real estate  operations.  These  increases  were  partially
offset  by  lower  returns  on the  securities  portfolio  due to  stock  market
volatility.  Also,  revenue in 1998  included  $4.3  million of dividend  income
received from an emerging technology investment.

OPERATING EXPENSES

ENERGY  SERVICES'  operating  expenses  decreased  $1.5 million,  or 3%, in 1999
primarily due to a $5.5 million  reduction in fuel and purchased  power expenses
because of less steam generation and fewer purchases from other power suppliers,
and a $1.9 million decrease in depreciation  expense  primarily the result of an
updated production plant depreciation  study.  Operating expenses were also $2.7
million lower in 1999 because the  amortization of an early  retirement  program
was completed in July 1998.  These decreases were partially offset by a one-time
property  tax levy and  other  expenses  related  to an  industrial  development
project totaling $3.6 million,  and higher  compensation and consulting  service
expenses.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES'  operating expenses were up $55.8 million, or 20%, in 1999
primarily  due to increased  sales  activity at the auction  facilities  and the
floorplan financing  business.  Additional expenses associated with more auction
facilities and loan  production  offices also  contributed to higher expenses in
1999.

WATER  SERVICES'  operating  expenses  were up $10.2  million,  or 12%,  in 1999
primarily due to inclusion of PCUC and Mid South operations.

INVESTMENTS'  operating expenses were up $1.6 million,  or 7%, in 1999 primarily
due to more sales by our real estate operations.

CORPORATE  CHARGES  decreased  $6.5  million,  or 17%, in 1999 because  interest
expense in 1998 reflected a settlement with the Internal  Revenue Service on tax
issues relating to prior years.  As a result of the settlement,  a previous $4.7
million income tax expense accrual was reversed and recorded as interest expense
in the first  quarter of 1998.  There was no impact on  consolidated  net income
from this  transaction.  Also,  interest expense was reduced in 1999 because the
average commercial paper balance was lower.

OUTLOOK

CORPORATE. Our businesses in 43 states and nine Canadian provinces employ 13,000
employees engaged in Energy Services,  Automotive  Services,  Water Services and
Investments.  We  expect  to  continue  to  focus  on  attaining  our  strategic
objectives of substantially  growing  earnings,  achieving market  leadership in
each of our businesses,  significantly  enhancing total shareholder  return with
the objective of increasing our market capitalization to over $4 billion by 2005
and achieving market recognition as a multi-services  company. While maintaining
the quality of our credit and security  ratings,  we plan to achieve these goals
through  selective  acquisitions and internal growth within our businesses.  Our
$438 million investment in new vehicle auction facilities during 2000,  followed
by our $63 million  investment in auction  facilities  that provide "total loss"
vehicle  recovery  services  in  January  2001,  is  consistent  with our growth
strategy. These investments are expected to contribute to our goal of 12% growth
in operating earnings in 2001.

ENERGY  SERVICES.  Energy Services  continues to be a strong cash flow generator
for us. Our  access to and  ownership  of  low-cost  power are Energy  Services'
greatest  strengths and we will continue to look for opportunities to add to our
low-cost energy  portfolio.  We have more than adequate  generation to serve our
native  load.  Power  over and above our  customers'  requirements  is  marketed
through MPEX and Split Rock.

Since  approximately  half of the electricity  Minnesota Power sells is to large
industrial  customers,   primarily  taconite  producers,  which  have  long-term
all-requirements contracts, the livelihood of the taconite industry is important
to us. Annual  taconite  production in Minnesota was 47 million tons in 2000 (43
million  tons in 1999;  47 million  tons in 1998).  Based on our research of the
taconite industry,  Minnesota taconite  production for 2001 is anticipated to be
about 37 million tons.

The  anticipated  decrease  in 2001  taconite  production  is due to high import
levels and a softening economy.  The majority of the anticipated  10-million ton
reduction  in taconite  production  for 2001 is  occurring at mines that are not
Large Power Customers.  Two Large Power Customers have announced  temporary shut
downs,  accounting  for  approximately  2 million  tons of the  decrease.  While
taconite  production is currently expected to continue at annual levels of about
40 million tons,  the  longer-term  outlook for this  cyclical  industry is less
certain.  Long-term  contracts with our Large Power  Customers help minimize the
impact on earnings that  otherwise  would result from such decreases in taconite
production.  We expect any excess  energy not used by our Large Power  Customers
will be marketed by MPEX and Split Rock.

Energy  Services  continues to pursue plans to  construct  in  partnership  with
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation a 250-mile,  345-kilovolt transmission line
from  Wausau,  Wisconsin  to Duluth,  Minnesota  and pursue  regional  wholesale
merchant  generating  plant  opportunities.   Minnesota  Power  also  signed  an
agreement to install a 24-MW turbine  generator at Potlatch  Corp.'s facility in
Cloquet,  Minnesota  by  mid-2001.  While  Minnesota  Power will own the turbine
generator and have access to its excess power in times of high demand,  Potlatch
will  operate  and  maintain  the  facility.  Energy  Services  intends  to seek
additional  cost  saving   alternatives   and   efficiencies,   and  expand  its
non-regulated services to maintain its contribution to overall net income.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES. We anticipate earnings from Automotive Services to increase
by more than 40% in 2001. This earnings  growth  includes a 10% to 15% increase
in EBITDAL from same store ADESA  auction  facilities.  Since 1995 when we first
entered the automotive industry, we have transformed and expanded our Automotive
Services  operations.  Automotive Services is now our largest contributor to net
income.

ADESA is the second  largest and fastest  growing  vehicle  auction  business in
North America.  The 2000  acquisition of CAG added 13 Canadian  vehicle  auction
facilities and associated dealer financing  business to Automotive  Services and
established ADESA as the premier  automotive  services company in Canada.  ADESA
also acquired or opened 15 other vehicle auction facilities in 2000.

ADESA's  purchase of the  remaining 53% ownership in Impact Auto in 2000 and APC
in January  2001  position  us as the third  largest  provider  of "total  loss"
vehicle  recovery  services  in  North  America  with  19  auction   facilities.
Simultaneously with the APC transaction, ADESA acquired ComSearch. Supplementing
Internet product  offerings at ADESA and APC,  ComSearch  brings  Internet-based
technology in the auto parts location and insurance adjustment business. We will
continue to look for accretive  acquisitions  not only in the wholesale  vehicle
auction  business,  but  also  in the  "total  loss"  vehicle  recovery  auction
business.

AFC's new computer  application  system  allows AFC to manage its business  more
effectively  while  expediting  services through its branch network to more than
15,000 registered dealers. AutoVIN expanded its inventory inspection services in
2000 to include  dealers  selling other  products,  such as motorcycles and lawn
equipment. While inventory verification is still the core of AutoVIN's business,
its growth potential is dramatically  increased by providing inspection services
for other products.

Vehicle sales within the auto auction industry are expected to rise at a rate of
2% to 4% annually  over the next several  years.  With the  continued  increased
popularity  of  leasing  and the high  cost of new  vehicles,  a steady  flow of
vehicles is expected to return to auction.  Automotive  Services also expects to
participate in the industry's growth through selective acquisitions and expanded
services.

ADESA and AFC  continue  to focus on growth in the volume of  vehicles  sold and
financed,   increased  ancillary  services,   and  operating  and  technological
efficiencies.  Great Rigs, PAR and ADESA  Importation plan to participate in the
growth of auction volume and enhance market share.

WATER  SERVICES.  Florida Water will continue to grow by  selectively  acquiring
targeted  water  systems.  The  strategic  emphasis at Heater is growth in North
Carolina.  Both Florida  Water and Heater  operate in states that are  currently
experiencing  rapid population  growth,  which should contribute to our expected
annual customer growth of 4% to 7% over the next two years.

Severe drought  conditions over the last several months in Florida have prompted
three out of the five Florida water management districts to issue Water Shortage
Orders  limiting lawn watering to one or two days per week.  The Orders  request
all local governments to enforce the restrictions  which will be in effect until
further notice from each water  district.  The Water Shortage  Orders affect the
majority of Florida  Water's  customers (all but one community) and could affect
water  revenue in 2001.  At this time,  however,  we are unable to predict  what
impact these Orders may have on Water Services' financial results for 2001.

INVESTMENTS.  Over the last 5 years, sales by real estate operations have been 3
to 4 times more than the acquisition cost of property sold, creating strong cash
generation and profitability. Our real estate operations may, from time to time,
acquire large residential  community  properties at low cost, add value and sell
them at  current  market  prices  in order to  continue  a  consistent  earnings
contribution from this business.

Our investments in emerging technology funds make capital available to companies
developing  products and services critical to the future of the electric utility
industry.  Our  focus  has been  primarily  on micro  generation  and fuel  cell
technology.  We view our  investments  in these funds as a source of capital for
redeployment  into existing  businesses and additional  business  opportunities.
With many of these funds now maturing,  our investments may add to income in the
future. The balance in our securities  portfolio declined  significantly in 2000
due to  acquisitions.  We plan to  continue  to  concentrate  on  market-neutral
investment  strategies designed to provide stable and acceptable returns without
sacrificing needed liquidity.  Our portfolio is hedged against market downturns.
Our objective is to maintain corporate liquidity.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

A primary goal of the  strategic  plan is to improve cash flow from  operations.
Since 1996 cash from  operating  activities  has tripled.  This increase in cash
flow from operations has been  accomplished due to operating  results and better
management of working  capital  throughout  our company.  Our strategy  includes
growing the businesses both internally  with expanded  facilities,  services and
operations (see Capital Requirements) and externally through acquisitions.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper.  Our  securities  investments  can be
liquidated  to  provide  funds  for  reinvestment  in  existing   businesses  or
acquisition of new businesses.  Approximately 6 million original issue shares of
our common stock are available for issuance  through Invest  Direct,  our direct
stock purchase and dividend  reinvestment plan.  ALLETE's $205 million bank line
of credit provides credit support for our commercial  paper program.  The amount
and timing of future sales of our securities will depend upon market  conditions
and our specific needs. We may from time to time sell securities to meet capital
requirements,  to provide for the  retirement  or early  redemption of issues of
long-term debt, to reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments for  services  provided.  However,  ADESA has  arrangements  to use the
proceeds from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term
working capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to
vehicle sellers and the  availability of funds from vehicle  purchasers.  During
the sales process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

AFC also has  arrangements  to use proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper
ALLETE has issued to meet its operational  requirements.  AFC offers  short-term
on-site financing for dealers to purchase vehicles at auctions in exchange for a
security  interest in those  vehicles.  The  financing  is provided  through the
earlier of the date the dealer sells the vehicle or a general  borrowing term of
30 to 45 days.

AFC sells certain  finance  receivables on a revolving  basis to a wholly owned,
unconsolidated,  qualified special purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn
sells,  on  a  revolving  basis,  an  undivided  interest  in  eligible  finance
receivables,  up to a maximum at any one time  outstanding  of $300 million,  to
third party  purchasers  under an agreement  that expires at the end of 2002. At
December  31, 2000 AFC had sold  $335.7  million of finance  receivables  to the
special purpose  subsidiary  ($296.8 million at December 31, 1999).  Third party
purchasers  had purchased an undivided  interest in finance  receivables of $239
million from this  subsidiary at December 31, 2000 ($225 million at December 31,
1999).  AFC has  also  entered  into an  arrangement  in  December  2000  with a
manufacturer to floorplan  certain vehicles located at auctions  awaiting resale
for a security interest in those vehicles.  AFC sells these finance receivables,
on a revolving basis, to another wholly owned, unconsolidated, qualified special
purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary  borrows money from a third party under an
agreement  that expires  June 15, 2001.  At December 31, 2000 AFC had sold $53.5
million of these finance  receivables  to the special  purpose  subsidiary.  The
third party lender had advanced $43 million  against these  receivables.  Unsold
finance  receivables  and  unfinanced  receivables  held by the special  purpose
subsidiaries are recorded by AFC as residual  interest at fair value. Fair value
is based upon  estimates  of future cash flows,  using  assumptions  that market
participants  would  use to  value  such  instruments,  including  estimates  of
anticipated  credit  losses  over  the  life  of the  receivables  sold  without
application of a discount rate due to the short-term  nature of the  receivables
sold. The fair value of AFC's  residual  interest was $106.2 million at December
31, 2000 ($57.6  million at December 31,  1999).  Proceeds  from the sale of the
receivables were used to repay borrowings from ALLETE and fund vehicle inventory
purchases for AFC's customers.

Significant  changes in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable  balances at
December  31,  2000  compared  to  December  31,  1999  were due to  significant
acquisitions in 2000, and increased  sales and financing  activity at Automotive
Services.

SALE OF  INVESTMENTS.  In May 2000 we sold 4.7  million  shares  of ACE.  ALLETE
received the ACE shares and $25 million in cash in December 1999 when Capital Re
merged with ACE. Prior to the merger,  we owned 7.3 million  shares,  or 20%, of
Capital  Re.  The $127  million  in  proceeds  from the sale of ACE  shares  and
proceeds  from the sale of a portion of our  securities  portfolio  were used to
fund auction acquisitions.

ACQUISITIONS.  In February 2000 ADESA purchased the Mission City Auto Auction in
San Diego, California.

In May 2000 ADESA Canada  purchased  the  remaining  27% of Impact  Auto.  ADESA
Canada  acquired  20% of Impact  Auto on October 1, 1995,  27% in March 1999 and
another 26% in January 2000.  Impact Auto is Canada's largest provider of "total
loss"  vehicle  recovery  services.  Impact  Auto  provides  these  services  to
insurance companies.

In June 2000 ADESA  acquired  all of the  outstanding  common  shares of Auction
Finance Group,  Inc. (AFG).  AFG owns CAAG Auto Auction Holdings Ltd., which was
doing business as Canadian  Auction  Group.  This  acquisition  added 13 vehicle
auction  facilities and associated dealer financing business to ADESA's existing
locations and established  ADESA as the premier  automotive  services company in
Canada.

In August 2000 ADESA  acquired  Beebe Auto  Exchange,  Inc.  which  operated two
Arkansas  auto  auctions:  Mid-Ark Auto Auction in North Little Rock and Central
Arkansas  Auto Auction in Beebe,  Arkansas,  and 51% of Interstate  Auto Auction
located  in Ocala,  Florida.

In October 2000 ADESA purchased nine auction facilities from Manheim.

The  transactions  described  in the five  preceding  paragraphs  had a combined
purchase price of approximately $438 million.  We funded these transactions with
proceeds from the sale of ACE shares, proceeds from the sale of a portion of our
securities portfolio, internally generated funds and long-term debt.

In June 2000  Florida  Water  purchased  the  assets  of  Spruce  Creek for $5.5
million,  plus a commitment to pay fees for water connections through June 2005.
Spruce Creek serves 5,600 water and wastewater customers in three communities in
Marion County, Florida. The systems acquired are designed to accommodate a total
of 10,000  water and  wastewater  customers.  The  transaction  was funded  with
internally generated funds.

In December  2000 ALLETE  Water  Services,  Inc.  purchased,  subject to certain
conditions, the assets of Dicks Creek Wastewater Utility for $6.6 million plus a
commitment  to pay a fee for  residential  connections.  Beginning in 2001,  the
commitment  fee will be a minimum of $400,000  annually  for four years or until
the cumulative fees paid reach $2 million. We expect to complete the transaction
in early 2001.  Dicks Creek is located near Atlanta in Forsyth County,  Georgia.
The transaction was funded with internally generated funds.

In  January  2001  ALLETE and ADESA  acquired  all of the  outstanding  stock of
ComSearch and all of the assets of APC in an overall transaction valued at $62.4
million.  APC is a provider of "total loss" vehicle recovery services with eight
auction facilities in the United States. ComSearch provides Internet-based parts
location  and  insurance  adjustment  audit  services  nationwide.  Both APC and
ComSearch are based in Rhode Island.  APC and ComSearch's  combined  revenue for
2000 was $38 million.  The  transactions  were funded with internally  generated
funds and the issuance of our common stock.

LONG-TERM  DEBT.  In March 2000 ADESA issued $35 million of 8.10% Senior  Notes,
Series B, due  March  2010.  Proceeds  were used to  refinance  short-term  bank
indebtedness   incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  vehicle  auction  facilities
purchased in 1999 and for general corporate purposes.

In June 2000 ALLETE  refinanced $4.6 million of 6.875% Pollution Control Revenue
Refunding Bonds,  Series 1991-A,  with $4.6 million of Adjustable Rate Pollution
Control Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 2000 due December 2015. The new bonds had
an initial interest rate of 4.75%.

In June 2000 Heater issued an $8 million,  8.24%, note to CoBank,  ACB, due June
2025. Proceeds were used to refinance short-term  indebtedness  incurred for the
1999 acquisition of Mid South and capital improvements in 1999 and 2000.

In July 2000 we filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415
under the  Securities  Act of 1933 for an  aggregate  of $400  million  of first
mortgage  bonds and debt  securities.  In October 2000 we issued $250 million of
Floating  Rate First  Mortgage  Bonds due  October  2003.  We have the option to
redeem these bonds on or after  October 20, 2001,  in whole or in part from time
to time,  on any interest  payment date prior to their  maturity.  Proceeds were
used to refinance  short-term  debt incurred in connection with the October 2000
acquisition of nine vehicle auction  facilities from Manheim.  The new bonds had
an initial  interest  rate of 7.61%.  We may sell the  remaining  securities  if
warranted by market conditions and our capital requirements.  Any offer and sale
of the remaining  first mortgage bonds and debt  securities will be made only by
means of a prospectus.

PREFERRED STOCK. In 2000 we redeemed all of our outstanding  Preferred Stock and
Preferred  Stock A with  proceeds  from the sale of a portion of our  securities
portfolio and internally generated funds.

All 100,000  outstanding shares of Serial Preferred Stock A, $7.125 Series, were
redeemed in April 2000 for an aggregate of $10 million.

All 100,000  outstanding shares of Serial Preferred Stock A, $6.70 Series,  were
redeemed in July 2000 for an aggregate of $10 million.

All 113,358  outstanding  shares of 5% Preferred  Stock were  redeemed in August
2000 at $102.50 per share plus  accrued and unpaid  dividends of $0.75 per share
for an aggregate of $11.7 million.

LEASES.  In April  2000  leases  for three  ADESA  auction  facilities  (Boston,
Charlotte and  Knoxville)  were  refinanced in a $28.4 million  leveraged  lease
transaction. The new lease expires on April 1, 2010, but may be terminated after
2005 under certain  conditions.  ALLETE has guaranteed ADESA's obligations under
the lease.

BOND RATINGS.  ALLETE's first mortgage bonds and secured pollution control bonds
are  currently  rated Baa1 by Moody's  Investors  Service and A by Standard  and
Poor's.  The  disclosure of these bond ratings is not a  recommendation  to buy,
sell or hold our securities.

PAYOUT  RATIO.  In 2000 we paid out 51%  (110% in 1999;  76% in 1998) of our per
share earnings in dividends.  Excluding the gain related to the ACE transaction,
in 2000 we paid out 64% of our per share  earnings in  dividends.  Excluding the
non-cash charge related to the Capital Re  transaction,  in 1999 we paid out 72%
of our per share earnings in dividends.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Consolidated  capital expenditures totaled $168.7 million in 2000 ($99.7 million
in 1999; $80.8 million in 1998). Expenditures in 2000 included $64.7 million for
Energy Services,  $74.2 million for Automotive Services, $29.6 million for Water
Services and $0.2 million for  Investments.  Internally  generated funds and the
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were the primary sources of funding
these capital expenditures.

Capital  expenditures  are  expected to be $166  million in 2001 and total about
$350 million for 2002  through  2005.  The 2001 amount  includes $58 million for
electric    co-generation,    system   component   replacement   and   upgrades,
telecommunication  fiber  and  coal  handling  equipment;  $75  million  for new
auctions currently under construction,  expansions and on-going  improvements at
existing vehicle auction  facilities and associated  computer  systems;  and $33
million to expand  water and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  to  accommodate
customer  growth,  to meet  environmental  standards and for water  conservation
initiatives.  We expect to use internally generated funds, and the proceeds from
the  issuance of  long-term  debt and equity  securities  to fund these  capital
expenditures.

MARKET RISK

Our  securities  portfolio  has exposure to both price and  interest  rate risk.
Investments  held  principally  for  near-term  sale are  classified  as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Trading  securities consist primarily of
common  stock of publicly  traded  companies.  In  strategies  designed to hedge
overall market risks, we also sell common stock short.  Investments  held for an
indefinite  period of time are classified as  available-for-sale  securities and
also recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2000 available-for-sale  securities
consisted of equity  securities in a grantor trust  established  to fund certain
employee benefits.

</TABLE>

We are also subject to interest rate risk through  outstanding  debt.  (See Note
9.) A portion of the  interest  rate risk is hedged  through the use of interest
rate swap agreements.

In October 2000 we entered into an interest rate swap  agreement with a notional
amount of $250 million to hedge $250  million of floating  rate debt also issued
in October 2000.  Under the one-year  swap  agreement,  we make fixed  quarterly
payments  based on a fixed rate of 6.5% and receive  payments at a floating rate
based on LIBOR (6.8% at December 31, 2000).

In March 2000 Florida Water entered into an interest rate swap  agreement with a
notional amount of $35.1 million to hedge $35.1 million of fixed rate industrial
development  bond debt. The swap agreement  superseded a previous swap agreement
entered into in 1998. Under the 25 year agreement, Florida Water makes quarterly
payments  at a floating  rate based upon The Bond Market  Association  Municipal
Swap  Index plus 174 basis  points  (4.8% at  December  31,  2000) and  receives
payments based on a fixed rate of 6.5%.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

As  of  January  1,  2001  we  adopted  SFAS  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133  establishes  accounting  and
reporting  standards  requiring that every derivative  instrument be recorded on
the  balance  sheet as  either an asset or  liability  measured  at fair  value.
Changes  in fair  value  are to be  recognized  in  current  earnings  or  other
comprehensive income, depending on the purpose for which the derivative is held.
Our use of derivative instruments is not significant. Upon adoption of SFAS 133,
we held  two  derivatives  in the form of  interest  rate  swaps,  both of which
qualify for hedge  accounting.  Both hedges are highly  effective  resulting  in
minimal earnings impact. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                        [PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP LOGO]

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of ALLETE

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  of cash flows and of  stockholders'  equity
present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of ALLETE and
its  subsidiaries  at  December  31,  2000 and 1999,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in  the  United  States  of  America.   These   financial   statements  are  the
responsibility  of  ALLETE's  management;  our  responsibility  is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  statements in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United  States of America which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements,
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  and evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe  that our audits  provide a reasonable  basis for the opinion  expressed
above. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

MANAGEMENT

The  consolidated  financial  statements and other  financial  information  were
prepared by management,  who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
The  financial  statements  have been  prepared  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles and  necessarily  include some amounts that are
based on informed judgments and best estimates and assumptions of management.

To meet management's  responsibilities with respect to financial information, we
maintain  and  enforce a system of  internal  accounting  controls  designed  to
provide assurance,  on a cost effective basis, that transactions are carried out
in accordance with management's  authorizations  and that assets are safeguarded
against  loss from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The system  includes  an
organizational   structure   that  provides  an   appropriate   segregation   of
responsibilities,  careful selection and training of personnel, written policies
and  procedures,  and periodic  reviews by our  internal  audit  department.  In
addition,  we have  personnel  policies that require all employees to maintain a
high standard of ethical  conduct.  Management  believes the system is effective
and provides  reasonable  assurance that all transactions are properly  recorded
and have been executed in accordance with management's authorization. Management
modifies and improves our system of internal  accounting controls in response to
changes in business  conditions.  Our  internal  audit staff is charged with the
responsibility for determining compliance with our procedures.

Four of our directors, not members of management,  serve as the Audit Committee.
Our Board of  Directors,  through  the Audit  Committee,  oversees  management's
responsibilities  for financial  reporting.  The Audit Committee meets regularly
with  management,  the internal  auditors  and the  independent  accountants  to
discuss  auditing and financial  matters and to assure that each is carrying out
their  responsibilities.  The internal auditors and the independent  accountants
have full and free access to the Audit  Committee  without  management  present.
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, independent accountants,  are engaged to express an
opinion on the financial statements. Their audit is conducted in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards and includes a review of internal controls
and tests of transactions to the extent necessary to allow them to report on the
fairness of our operating  results and financial  condition.  [GRAPHIC OMITTED -

2 OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION. References in this report to "we" and "our" are
to  ALLETE  and  its  subsidiaries,   collectively.  We  prepare  our  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
principles  require  management to make informed  judgments,  best estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  Our consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts  of ALLETE and all of our  majority  owned  subsidiary  companies.  All
material   intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  We are a multi-services  company that has operations in four
principal  business  segments.  Energy Services,  Automotive  Services and Water
Services segments were determined based on products and services  provided.  The
Investment segment was determined based on short-term  corporate liquidity needs
and the need to provide financial flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives in
the other business  segments.  We measure  performance of our operations through
careful  budgeting and monitoring of contributions to consolidated net income by
business  segment.  Corporate  charges  consist  of  expenses  incurred  by  our
corporate headquarters and interest and preferred stock expense not specifically
identifiable to a business segment. Our policy is to not allocate these expenses
to business segments.

ENERGY SERVICES.  Energy Services  generate,  transmit,  distribute,  market and
trade electricity. Native load electric service is provided to 144,000 customers
in northeastern  Minnesota and  northwestern  Wisconsin.  Large Power Customers,
which include five taconite  producers,  four paper and pulp mills, two pipeline
companies and one manufacturer, purchase about half of the electricity Minnesota
Power sells under  all-requirements  contracts with  expiration  dates extending
from May 2001  through  December  2008.  (See Item 1. - Energy  Services - Large
Power Customers in this Form 10-K.) MPEX, a division of Minnesota Power, markets
power  across the  Midwest  and  Canada.  Split Rock  Energy  LLC,  formed as an
alliance between  Minnesota Power and Great River Energy,  combines power supply
capabilities and customer loads to share market and supply risks and to optimize
power trading  opportunities.  Split Rock contracts for exclusive  services from
MPEX. BNI Coal, a wholly owned  subsidiary,  mines and sells lignite coal to two
North Dakota mine-mouth  generating units, one of which is Square Butte.  Square
Butte supplies approximately 71% (322 MW) of its output to Minnesota Power under
a long-term contract. (See Note 14.)

Electric  rates  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  various  state  and  federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued for service provided but not billed.  Electric rates include  adjustment
clauses that bill or credit  customers for fuel and purchased energy costs above
or below the base levels in rate  schedules  and bill retail  customers  for the
recovery of CIP expenditures not collected in base rates.

AUTOMOTIVE   SERVICES.   Automotive   Services   include  several  wholly  owned
subsidiaries operating as integral parts of the vehicle redistribution business.

ADESA is the second largest vehicle auction network in North America. ADESA owns
or leases,  and  operates 54 vehicle  auctions  in the United  States and Canada
through which used cars and other  vehicles are purchased and sold by franchised
automobile  dealers and licensed used car dealers.  Sellers at ADESA's  auctions
include  domestic  and  foreign  auto  manufacturers,  car  dealers,  automotive
fleet/lease  companies,  banks and finance companies.  ADESA also has 19 auction
facilities  in the United  States and Canada that provide  "total loss"  vehicle
recovery services to insurance  companies.  AFC provides inventory financing for
wholesale and retail automobile dealers who purchase vehicles at ADESA auctions,
independent  auctions  and  other  auction  chains.  AFC has 86 loan  production
offices  located  across the United  States and Canada.  These  offices  provide
qualified  dealers  credit to purchase  vehicles at any of the 400 plus auctions
approved by AFC.  Great Rigs is one of the  nation's  largest  independent  used
automobile transport companies with more than 140 automotive carriers. It offers
customers  pick  up  and  delivery  service  through  11  strategically  located
transportation  hubs in the United States. PAR provides  customized  remarketing
services,  including transporting and liquidating off-lease vehicles, to various
businesses with fleet  operations.  AutoVIN,  a 90% owned  subsidiary,  provides
professional field information  services to the automotive  industry,  including
vehicle condition reporting, inventory verification auditing, program compliance
auditing and facility  inspection.  ADESA, Great Rigs, PAR and AutoVIN recognize
revenue when services are performed.  AFC revenue is comprised of gains on sales
of  receivables,  and  interest,  fee and servicer  income.  As is customary for
finance  companies,  AFC  revenue is reported  net of  interest  expense of $2.7
million in 2000 ($2.0  million in 1999;  $1.8  million in 1998).  AFC  generally
sells its United States dollar denominated finance receivables through a private
securitization  structure.   Gains  and  losses  on  such  sales  are  generally
recognized at the time of settlement  based on the difference  between the sales
proceeds and the allocated basis of the finance  receivables sold,  adjusted for
transaction fees and residual interest  retained.  AFC also retains the right to
service receivables sold through the securitization and receives a fee for doing
so.

WATER  SERVICES.  Water  Services  include  several  wholly owned  subsidiaries.
Florida Water is the largest  investor  owned  supplier of water and  wastewater
utility services in Florida.  Heater is the largest investor owned water utility
in North Carolina.  Heater also provides  wastewater services in North Carolina.

INVESTMENTS. Investments include real estate operations, investments in emerging
technologies  funds  related to the electric  utility  industry and a securities
portfolio.  Our real estate  operations  include Cape Coral  Holdings and an 80%
ownership in Lehigh. Both are Florida companies which through their subsidiaries
own real estate in Florida.  Real estate  revenue is  recognized  on the accrual
basis. Our emerging technology  investments provide us with access to developing
technologies  before their  commercial  debut, as well as financial  returns and
diversification opportunities.  We view these investments as a source of capital
for  redeployment in existing  businesses and a potential entree into additional
business  opportunities.  Our securities portfolio is intended to provide stable
earnings and liquidity. Proceeds from the securities portfolio are available for
reinvestment in existing businesses, to fund strategic initiatives and for other
corporate purposes.

DEPRECIATION.  Property,  plant and equipment are recorded at original cost, and
are  reported  on  the  balance  sheet  net  of  accumulated   depreciation  and
contributions in aid of construction. Expenditures for additions and significant
replacements and improvements are capitalized;  maintenance and repair costs are
expensed as incurred.  Expenditures for major plant overhauls are also accounted
for using this same policy.  When  property,  plant and equipment are retired or
otherwise  disposed of, gains or losses are recognized in revenue.  When utility
property,  plant and equipment are retired or otherwise  disposed of, no gain or
loss is  recognized.  Contributions  in aid of  construction  relate to  utility
assets,  and are amortized over the estimated life of the associated asset. This
amortization reduces depreciation expense.  Contributions in aid of construction
relate to water assets and amounted to $203.9 million in 2000 ($189.6 million in
1999).

Depreciation is computed using the estimated useful lives of the various classes
of plant.  In 2000 average  depreciation  rates for the energy,  automotive  and
water services segments were 3.3%, 3.7% and 2.0%,  respectively  (3.3%, 3.9% and
2.2%, respectively, in 1999; 3.5%, 4.1% and 2.6%, respectively, in 1998).

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Accounts receivable is reported on the balance sheet net of
an allowance for doubtful accounts.  The allowance is based on our evaluation of
the receivable  portfolio under current  conditions,  the size of the portfolio,
overall  portfolio  quality,  review of specific problems and such other factors
that in our judgment deserve recognition in estimating losses.

AFC sells certain  finance  receivables on a revolving  basis to a wholly owned,
unconsolidated,  qualified special purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary in turn
sells,  on  a  revolving  basis,  an  undivided  interest  in  eligible  finance
receivables,  up to a maximum at any one time  outstanding  of $300 million,  to
third party  purchasers  under an agreement  that expires at the end of 2002. At
December  31, 2000 AFC had sold  $335.7  million of finance  receivables  to the
special purpose  subsidiary  ($296.8 million at December 31, 1999).  Third party
purchasers  had purchased an undivided  interest in finance  receivables of $239
million from this  subsidiary at December 31, 2000 ($225 million at December 31,
1999).  AFC has  also  entered  into an  arrangement  in  December  2000  with a
manufacturer to floorplan  certain vehicles located at auctions  awaiting resale
for a security interest in those vehicles.  AFC sells these finance receivables,
on a revolving basis, to another wholly owned, unconsolidated, qualified special
purpose  subsidiary.  This subsidiary  borrows money from a third party under an
agreement  that expires  June 15, 2001.  At December 31, 2000 AFC had sold $53.5
million of these finance  receivables  to the special  purpose  subsidiary.  The
third party lender had advanced $43 million  against these  receivables.  Unsold
finance  receivables  and  unfinanced  receivables  held by the special  purpose
subsidiaries are recorded by AFC as residual  interest at fair value. Fair value
is based upon  estimates  of future cash flows,  using  assumptions  that market
participants  would  use to  value  such  instruments,  including  estimates  of
anticipated  credit  losses  over  the  life  of the  receivables  sold  without
application of a discount rate due to the short-term  nature of the  receivables
sold. The fair value of AFC's  residual  interest was $106.2 million at December
31, 2000 ($57.6  million at December 31,  1999).  Proceeds  from the sale of the
receivables were used to repay borrowings from ALLETE and fund vehicle inventory
purchases for AFC's customers.

INVENTORIES.  Inventories, which include fuel, material and supplies, are stated
at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.

GOODWILL.  Goodwill  primarily  relates to the Automotive  Services  segment and
represents  the  excess  of cost over  identifiable  net  assets  of  businesses
acquired.  Amortization  is  computed  on a  straight-line  basis over a 40 year
period.   Operating   expenses  in  2000   included  $8.2  million  of  goodwill
amortization ($5.1 million in 1999; $4.9 million in 1998).

UNAMORTIZED EXPENSE, DISCOUNT AND PREMIUM ON DEBT. Expense, discount and premium
on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. We consider all investments purchased with maturities
of three months or less to be cash  equivalents.

FOREIGN   CURRENCY   TRANSLATION.   Results  of  operations   for  our  Canadian
subsidiaries  are  translated  into  United  States  dollars  using the  average
exchange rates during the period.  Assets and  liabilities  are translated  into
United States dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date,  except
for  intangibles  and fixed assets,  which are  translated at historical  rates.

3 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

ADESA AUCTION FACILITIES. In February 2000 ADESA purchased the Mission City Auto
Auction in San Diego, California.

In May 2000 ADESA Canada  purchased  the  remaining  27% of Impact  Auto.  ADESA
Canada  acquired  20% of Impact  Auto on October 1, 1995,  27% in March 1999 and
another 26% in January 2000.  Impact Auto is Canada's largest national  provider
of "total loss" vehicle recovery services to insurance companies.

In June 2000 ADESA  acquired  all of the  outstanding  common  shares of Auction
Finance Group,  Inc. (AFG).  AFG owns CAAG Auto Auction Holdings Ltd., which was
doing business as Canadian  Auction  Group.  This  acquisition  added 13 vehicle
auction  facilities and associated dealer financing business to ADESA's existing
locations and established  ADESA as the premier  automotive  services company in
Canada.

In August 2000 ADESA  acquired  Beebe Auto  Exchange,  Inc.  which  operated two
Arkansas  auto  auctions:  Mid-Ark Auto Auction in North Little Rock and Central
Arkansas Auto Auction in Beebe,  Arkansas,  and 51% of  Interstate  Auto Auction
located in Ocala, Florida.

In October 2000 ADESA purchased nine auction facilities from Manheim.

The  transactions  described  in the five  preceding  paragraphs  had a combined
purchase  price of  approximately  $438 million and resulted in goodwill of $298
million,  which  we are  amortizing  over a  40-year  useful  life.  We used the
purchase method of accounting for these  transactions  and included an estimated
allocation of the purchase  price for the Manheim  transaction.  Final  purchase
accounting  adjustments  are not expected to be material  for this  transaction.
Financial  results have been included in our consolidated  financial  statements
since the date of each  purchase.  Pro  forma  financial  results  have not been
presented due to immateriality.

In April 1999 ADESA acquired Des Moines Auto Auction located in Des Moines, Iowa
and in July 1999 ADESA Canada,  Inc. purchased the Vancouver Auto Auction of New
Westminster,  British  Columbia.  The two transactions  had a combined  purchase
price of $31.3  million  and were  accounted  for using the  purchase  method of
accounting  resulting in goodwill of $11.9 million.  Financial  results for each
facility have been included in our consolidated  financial  statements since the
date of purchase. Financial results prior to the acquisition were not material.

ADESA acquired the assets of Greater  Lansing Auto Auction in Lansing,  Michigan
and I-55 Auto Auction in St. Louis,  Missouri in April 1998, and Ark-La-Tex Auto
Auction in  Shreveport,  Louisiana in May 1998 for a combined  purchase price of
$23.8 million.  The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting  and  resulted in  additional  goodwill of $16.3  million.  Financial
results  for  these  three  auctions  have  been  included  in our  consolidated
financial statements since the dates of acquisition.  Financial results prior to
the acquisition were not material.

ACQUISITION  OF SPRUCE CREEK SOUTH  UTILITIES  INC. In June 2000  Florida  Water
purchased the assets of Spruce Creek for $5.5 million,  plus a commitment to pay
a fee for water connections through June 2005. The transaction was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. Financial results have been included in
our  consolidated  financial  statements  since the date of purchase.  Pro forma
financial  results have not been  presented due to  immateriality.  Spruce Creek
serves  5,600 water and  wastewater  customers  in three  communities  in Marion
County,  Florida.  The systems  acquired are designed to  accommodate a total of
10,000 water and wastewater customers.

ACQUISITION  OF DICKS  CREEK.  In December  2000  ALLETE  Water  Services,  Inc.
purchased,  subject to certain conditions,  the assets of Dicks Creek Wastewater
Utility  for  $6.6  million  plus  a  commitment  to pay a fee  for  residential
connections. Beginning in 2001, the commitment fee will be a minimum of $400,000
annually for four years or until the cumulative  fees paid reach $2 million.  We
expect to complete  the  transaction  in early  2001.  The  transaction  will be
accounted for using the purchase  method of  accounting.  Dicks Creek is located
near Atlanta in Forsyth County, Georgia.

ACQUISITION  OF PALM COAST  UTILITY  CORPORATION.  In January 1999 Florida Water
purchased the assets and assumed  certain  liabilities of PCUC for $16.8 million
plus $1,000 per new water connection for an eight-year  period.  We estimate the
present value of these future water  connections at $5.1 million.  PCUC provides
water and wastewater  services in Flagler County,  Florida.  The transaction was
accounted for using the purchase  method of accounting.  Financial  results have
been  included  in our  consolidated  financial  statements  since  the  date of
purchase. Financial results prior to the acquisition were not material.

ACQUISITION  OF CAPE CORAL.  In June 1999 Cape Coral  Holdings,  a subsidiary of
ALLETE Properties,  purchased, for $45.0 million, certain real estate properties
located in Cape  Coral,  Florida.  Cape Coral,  located  adjacent to Fort Myers,
Florida,   has  a  population  of  100,000  and  is  Florida's   second  largest
municipality in land area.  Properties  purchased included  approximately  2,500
acres of commercial  and  residential  zoned land,  including home sites, a golf
resort,  marina and commercial buildings.  Concurrently with the purchase,  Cape
Coral Holdings  assigned to a third party the rights to a shopping  center and a
portion of the vacant land for $8.8  million,  which reduced the net amount paid
by Cape Coral Holdings to $36.2 million. The transaction was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting.  Financial  results have been included in our
consolidated financial statements since the date of purchase.  Financial results
prior to the acquisition were not material.

MID SOUTH WATER  SYSTEMS,  INC. In June 1999 Heater  acquired  the assets of Mid
South Water Systems,  Inc. (Mid South) located in Sherills Ford,  North Carolina
for $9 million.  The  acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  Financial results have been included in our consolidated  financial
statements  since  the  date  of  purchase.   Financial  results  prior  to  the
acquisition were not material. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

4 REGULATORY MATTERS

We file  for  periodic  rate  revisions  with  the  Minnesota  Public  Utilities
Commission (MPUC), the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC), the Florida
Public  Service   Commission  (FPSC)  and  other  state  and  county  regulatory
authorities.  Interim  rates in  Minnesota  and Florida are placed into  effect,
subject to refund with  interest,  pending a final  decision by the  appropriate
commission.  In 2000 43% of our consolidated operating revenue (47% in 1999; 52%
in 1998) was under regulatory authority.  The MPUC had regulatory authority over
approximately  29% in 2000  (31%  in  1999;  36% in  1998)  of our  consolidated
operating revenue.

ELECTRIC  RATES.  Restructuring  of the  electric  utility  industry  continues.
Twenty-five  states   representing   approximately  70%  of  the  United  States
population have passed either legislation or regulation that initiates a process
leading to retail  customer  choice.  Neither  Minnesota  nor  Wisconsin  (where
Minnesota Power has retail electric customers) have passed retail  restructuring
laws. In 2001 utility  restructuring  legislation will likely be debated at both
the federal level and in Minnesota and Wisconsin. It is unlikely,  however, that
the United States  Congress or the  legislatures  of Minnesota or Wisconsin will
enact retail choice legislation into law this year. We cannot predict the timing
or substance of any future legislation that might ultimately be enacted.  We are
taking all necessary steps to cultivate  community and customer  relations,  and
continue to maintain our competitive  position as a low-cost and long-term power
supplier to large industrial customers.  With electric rates among the lowest in
the United States, customer satisfaction high, and long-term wholesale and Large
Power Customer retail  contracts in place, we believe we are well positioned for
the future.

WATER AND WASTEWATER  RATES. In 1995 the Florida First District Court of Appeals
(Court of Appeals)  reversed a 1993 FPSC order  establishing  uniform  rates for
most of Florida  Water's  service areas.  With "uniform  rates" all customers in
each uniform rate area pay the same rates for water and wastewater services.  In
response to the Court of Appeals' order, in August 1996 the FPSC ordered Florida
Water to issue refunds to those customers who paid more since October 1993 under
uniform rates than they would have paid under stand-alone  rates. This order did
not permit a balancing surcharge to customers who paid less under uniform rates.
Florida  Water  appealed,  and the Court of Appeals  ruled in June 1997 that the
FPSC could not order refunds without  balancing  surcharges.  In response to the
Court of Appeals' ruling,  the FPSC issued an order in January 1998 that did not
require  refunds.  Florida Water's  potential  refund liability at that time was
about $12.5 million,  which included interest,  to customers who paid more under
uniform rates.

In the same January 1998 order, the FPSC required Florida Water to refund,  with
interest,  $2.5 million, the amount paid by customers in the Spring Hill service
area from January 1996 through June 1997 under  uniform  rates that exceeded the
amount  these  customers  would  have paid  under a  modified  stand-alone  rate
structure.  No balancing  surcharge was permitted.  The FPSC ordered this refund
because  Spring  Hill  customers  continued  to pay  uniform  rates  after other
customers  began  paying  modified  stand-alone  rates  effective  January  1996
pursuant to the FPSC's interim rate order in Florida Water's 1995 Rate Case. The
FPSC did not include  Spring Hill in this  interim rate order  because  Hernando
County had assumed  jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida
Water  reached an agreement  with  Hernando  County to revert  prospectively  to
stand-alone rates for Spring Hill customers.

Customer  groups that paid more under uniform rates  appealed the FPSC's January
1998 order,  arguing that they are entitled to a refund  because the FPSC had no
authority to order uniform  rates.  Florida Water also appealed the $2.5 million
refund order. Initial briefs were filed by all parties in May 1998. In June 1998
the Court of Appeals  reversed  its  previous  ruling  that the FPSC was without
authority to order uniform rates at which time customer  groups  supporting  the
FPSC's  January  1998 order  filed a motion  with the Court of  Appeals  seeking
dismissal of the appeal by customer groups seeking  refunds.  Customers  seeking
refunds filed amended  briefs in September  1998. A provision for refund related
to the $2.5 million refund order was recorded in 1999.

In December 2000 Hernando County approved a settlement agreement relating to the
Spring  Hill  refund  issue  that was  before  the Court of  Appeals.  Under the
settlement  agreement,  Spring Hill customers  would receive a prospective  rate
reduction over three years totaling $1.8 million with no refunds.  Florida Water
also  agreed  it would  not file a rate case to  increase  rates to Spring  Hill
customers  for a period of three  years.  In December  2000 the Court of Appeals
remanded the issue back to the FPSC for settlement consideration.  We are unable
to predict the timing or outcome of the appeal and settlement process.

DEFERRED REGULATORY CHARGES AND CREDITS. Deferred regulatory charges and credits
are included in other assets and other  liabilities on our consolidated  balance
sheet.  Our  utility  operations  are  subject  to the  provisions  of SFAS  71,
"Accounting  for the Effects of Certain Types of  Regulation."  We capitalize as
deferred  regulatory  charges  incurred  costs which are probable of recovery in
future utility rates.  Deferred regulatory credits represent amounts expected to
be credited to customers in rates.  Based on current rate treatment,  we believe
all deferred regulatory charges are probable of recovery. [GRAPHIC OMITTED -

5 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SECURITIES  INVESTMENTS.  Our securities  portfolio is managed internally and by
selected  outside  managers.  Securities held principally for near-term sale are
classified as trading  securities  and included in current assets at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of trading  securities  are  recognized  in  earnings.
Trading  securities  consist  primarily of the common  stock of publicly  traded
companies.  Securities  held for an indefinite  period of time are classified as
available-for-sale  securities  and  included  in  investments  at  fair  value.
Unrealized  gains and losses on  available-for-sale  securities  are included in
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income,  net of  tax.  Unrealized  losses  on
available-for-sale  securities  that are other than  temporary are recognized in
earnings.  Realized  gains and losses are computed on each  specific  investment
sold.  At December 31, 2000  available-for-sale  securities  consisted of equity
securities in a grantor trust established to fund certain employee benefits.  At
December 31, 1999 available-for-sale securities also included 4.7 million shares
of ACE  Limited  (which  were sold in  2000).  Before  1999,  available-for-sale
securities consisted primarily of the preferred stock of utilities and financial
institutions  with  investment  grade debt ratings.  During 1999, we changed our
strategy  for this  preferred  stock  which  resulted in a  reclassification  to
trading and we recognized an unrealized loss of $2.6 million.

Before  discontinuance  of the  equity  method of  accounting  in 1999,  we also
recorded  our share of  unrealized  gains  and  losses  from  available-for-sale
securities held by Capital Re, a $5.5 million gain in 1998.

The net unrealized loss included in earnings for trading  securities in 2000 was
$2.3 million ($1.6 million loss in 1999; $0.7 million gain in 1998).

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  AND RISKS.  In  portfolio  strategies
designed  to  reduce  market  risks,  we sell  common  stock  securities  short.
Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  short  sales  are  recognized  in  earnings.
Previously,  treasury futures were used as a hedge to reduce interest rate risks
associated with holding fixed dividend  preferred  stocks.  We no longer utilize
treasury  futures as most of the fixed  dividend  preferred  stocks were sold in
2000.

In October 2000 we entered into an interest rate swap  agreement with a notional
amount of $250 million to hedge $250  million of floating  rate debt also issued
in October 2000.  Under the one-year  swap  agreement,  we make fixed  quarterly
payments  based on a fixed rate of 6.5% and receive  payments at a floating rate
based on LIBOR (6.8% at December 31,  2000).  The agreement is subject to market
risk due to interest rate fluctuation.

In March 2000 Florida Water entered into an interest rate swap  agreement with a
notional  amount of $35.1 million to hedge fixed rate  long-term  debt. The swap
agreement  superseded a previous swap agreement  entered into in 1998. Under the
25 year  agreement,  Florida Water makes  quarterly  payments at a variable rate
based  upon The Bond  Market  Association  Municipal  Swap  Index plus 174 basis
points (4.8% at December 31, 2000) and receives  payments  based on a fixed rate
of 6.5%.  The swap  agreement  is subject to market  risk due to  interest  rate
fluctuation.

Effective  with the  January  1,  2001  adoption  of SFAS  133,  Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  both interest rate swaps will be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.

The  fair  value  of  off-balance  sheet  financial  instruments  reflected  the
estimated  amounts that we would receive or pay if the contracts were terminated
at December 31. This fair value represents the difference  between the estimated
future  receipts  and  payments  under  the  terms  of each  instrument,  and is
estimated by obtaining  quoted market prices or by using common pricing  models.
These fair values should not be viewed in  isolation,  but rather in relation to
the fair value of the underlying hedged transaction.

Minnesota Power sells electricity to about 15 customers in northern  Minnesota's
taconite,  pipeline, paper and wood products industries.  Receivables from these
customers  totaled  approximately $12 million at December 31, 2000 ($8.2 million
at December 31,  1999).  Minnesota  Power does not obtain  collateral to support
utility  receivables,  but  monitors  the credit  standing  of major  customers.

6 INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL RE AND ACE

In May 2000 we recorded a $30.4 million,  or $0.44 per share,  after-tax gain on
the sale of 4.7 million shares of ACE Limited. We received 4.7 million shares of
ACE plus $25.1  million in December 1999 when Capital Re merged with ACE. At the
time of the merger we owned 7.3 million shares or 20% of Capital Re.

As a result of the  merger,  in 1999 we recorded a $36.2  million,  or $0.52 per
share,  after-tax  non-cash  charge as follows:  a $24.1  million,  or $0.35 per
share,  charge  in  the  second  quarter  following  the  merger  agreement  and
discontinuance of our equity  accounting for Capital Re and a $12.1 million,  or
$0.17 per share, charge in the fourth quarter upon completion of the merger.

In 1998 we used the equity  method to account for our  investment in Capital Re.
As a result of the pending merger with ACE, in 1999 we  discontinued  the equity
method of  accounting  for our  investment  in Capital Re and  accounted for our
investment in Capital Re as an available-for-sale  security.  [GRAPHIC OMITTED -

7 LEASING AGREEMENTS

In April 2000 leases for three ADESA auction facilities  (Boston,  Charlotte and
Knoxville) were refinanced in a $28.4 million leveraged lease  transaction.  The
new lease is treated as an operating lease for financial  reporting purposes and
expires in April  2010.  The lease may be  terminated  after 2005 under  certain
conditions. We have guaranteed ADESA's obligations under the lease.

We lease other  properties and equipment in addition to those listed above under
operating and capital lease  agreements  with terms  expiring  through 2010. The
aggregate  amount of future  minimum  lease  payments for capital and  operating
leases  during 2001 is $15.2  million  ($11.7  million in 2002;  $7.5 million in
2003;  $6.0 million in 2004;  and $5.2 million in 2005).  Total rent expense was
$27.0 million in 2000 ($21.5 million in 1999;  $16.7 million in 1998).  [GRAPHIC

8 JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITY

We own 80% of the 534 megawatt  Boswell  Energy  Center Unit 4 (Boswell Unit 4).
While we operate the plant,  certain  decisions  about the operations of Boswell
Unit 4 are subject to the  oversight  of a committee  on which we and  Wisconsin
Public Power,  Inc.  (WPPI),  the owner of the other 20% of Boswell Unit 4, have
equal  representation  and  voting  rights.  Each  of us  must  provide  our own
financing and is obligated to pay our ownership  share of operating  costs.  Our
share of direct  operating  expenses of Boswell  Unit 4 is included in operating
expense on our consolidated  statement of income.  Our 80% share of the original
cost  included in electric  plant at December  31, 2000 was $309  million  ($310
million at December 31,  1999).  The  corresponding  provision  for  accumulated
depreciation was $157 million at December 31, 2000 ($150 million at December 31,
1999). [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

The aggregate  amount of long-term  debt  maturing  during 2001 is $15.8 million
($10.9 million in 2002;  $286.9 million in 2003, $15.6 million in 2004; and $3.5
million in 2005).  Substantially  all of our electric and water plant is subject
to the lien of the mortgages securing various first mortgage bonds.

At December 31, 2000 we had  long-term  bank lines of credit  aggregating  $28.1
million ($58.8  million at December 31, 1999).  Drawn portions on these lines of
credit  aggregated  $14.1  million at December  31, 2000 ($43.5 at December  31,
1999) and are included in other long-term debt.

In March 2000 ADESA  issued $35  million of 8.10%  Senior  Notes,  Series B, due
March  2010.  Proceeds  were  used to  refinance  short-term  bank  indebtedness
incurred for the acquisition of vehicle auction facilities purchased in 1999 and
for general corporate purposes.

In June 2000 we  refinanced  $4.6 million of 6.875%  Pollution  Control  Revenue
Refunding  Bonds,  Series 1991-A with $4.6 million of Adjustable  Rate Pollution
Control Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 2000 due December 2015. The new bonds had
an initial interest rate of 4.75%.

Also in June 2000 Heater issued an $8 million,  8.24%, note to CoBank,  ACB, due
June 2025. Proceeds were used to refinance short-term  indebtedness incurred for
the 1999 acquisition of Mid South and capital improvements in 1999 and 2000.

In October 2000 we issued $250 million of Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due
October  2003.  We have the option to redeem these bonds on or after October 20,
2001, in whole or in part from time to time, on any interest  payment date prior
to their maturity.  Proceeds were used to refinance  short-term debt incurred in
connection with the October 2000 acquisition of nine vehicle auction  facilities
from  Manheim.  The new bonds had an initial  interest  rate of 7.61%.  [GRAPHIC

10 SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND COMPENSATING BALANCES

We have bank lines of credit aggregating $214.5 million ($75 million at December
31, 1999),  which make financing  available  through  short-term  bank loans and
provide  credit  support for  commercial  paper.  At December 31,  2000,  $211.0
million was available  for use ($74 million at December 31,  1999).  At December
31,  2000 we had issued  commercial  paper  with a face value of $260.6  million
($96.9 million in 1999),  with support  provided by bank lines of credit and our
securities portfolio.

Certain lines of credit require a commitment  fee of 0.0125%.  Interest rates on
commercial  paper and borrowings  under the lines of credit ranged from 7.28% to
7.90% at December 31, 2000 (6.42% to 6.70% at December 31,  1999).  The weighted
average  interest rate on  short-term  borrowings at December 31, 2000 was 7.57%
(6.59% at December  31,  1999).  The total  amount of  compensating  balances at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, was immaterial. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

11 COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our Articles of  Incorporation  and mortgages  contain  provisions  that,  under
certain circumstances,  would restrict the payment of common stock dividends. As
of December 31, 2000 no retained  earnings were  restricted as a result of these
provisions.

COMMON STOCK SPLIT. On March 2, 1999 our common stock was split two-for-one. All
common share and per share amounts in our financial  statements and notes to the
financial  statements  have  been  adjusted  for  all  periods  to  reflect  the
two-for-one stock split.

COMMON STOCK ISSUANCE.  In September 1998 4.2 million shares of our common stock
were sold in a public  offering  at $21.875  per share.  Total net  proceeds  of
approximately  $89 million were used to repay  outstanding  commercial paper, to
fund  strategic  initiatives  and for capital  expenditures.  Net  proceeds  not
immediately  used  for  the  above  purposes  were  invested  in our  securities
portfolio.

SHAREHOLDER  RIGHTS PLAN.  In 1996 we adopted a rights plan that  provides for a
dividend  distribution  of one  preferred  share  purchase  right  (Right) to be
attached to each share of common stock.

The Rights,  which are currently not exercisable or transferable  apart from our
common  stock,  entitle the holder to purchase one  two-hundredth  of a share of
ALLETE's  Junior  Serial  Preferred  Stock A, without par value,  at an exercise
price of $45.  These  Rights  would  become  exercisable  if a  person  or group
acquires beneficial  ownership of 15% or more of our common stock or announces a
tender offer which would increase the person's or group's  beneficial  ownership
interest to 15% or more of our common stock,  subject to certain exceptions.  If
the 15%  threshold  is met,  each  Right  entitles  the holder  (other  than the
acquiring   person  or  group)  to  purchase   common   stock  (or,  in  certain
circumstances, cash, property or other securities of ours) having a market price
equal to twice the exercise  price of the Right.  If we are acquired in a merger
or business combination, or 50% or more of our assets or earning power are sold,
each  exercisable  Right  entitles  the holder to purchase  common  stock of the
acquiring or surviving  company having a value equal to twice the exercise price
of  the  Right.  Certain  stock  acquisitions  will  also  trigger  a  provision
permitting  the Board of Directors  to exchange  each Right for one share of our
common stock.

The Rights which expire on July 23, 2006,  are  nonvoting and may be redeemed by
us at a price of $.005  per  Right at any  time  they are not  exercisable.  One
million shares of Junior Serial  Preferred  Stock A have been authorized and are
reserved for issuance under the plan.

EARNINGS PER SHARE. The difference  between basic and diluted earnings per share
arises from outstanding stock options and performance share awards granted under

12 PREFERRED STOCK

In 2000 we redeemed all of our outstanding Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock A
with  proceeds  from the  sale of a  portion  of our  securities  portfolio  and
internally generated funds.

All 100,000  shares of Serial  Preferred  Stock A, $7.125 Series  outstanding at
December 31, 1999 were redeemed in April 2000 for an aggregate of $10 million.

All 100,000  shares of Serial  Preferred  Stock A, $6.70 Series  outstanding  at
December 31, 1999 were redeemed in July 2000 for an aggregate of $10 million.

All 113,358 shares of 5% Preferred  Stock  outstanding at December 31, 1999 were
redeemed in August 2000 at $102.50 per share plus  accrued and unpaid  dividends
of $0.75 per share for an aggregate of $11.7 million. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

13 MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY

ALLETE Capital I (Trust) was established as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company  for the  purpose of  issuing  common and  preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  In March  1996 the  Trust  publicly  issued  three  million  8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial interests in the assets held by the Trust. The proceeds from the sale
of the QUIPS, and from common securities of the Trust issued to us, were used by
the  Trust to  purchase  from us $77.5  million  of  8.05%  Junior  Subordinated
Debentures,  Series  A, Due 2015  (Subordinated  Debentures),  resulting  in net
proceeds to us of $72.3  million.  Holders of the QUIPS are  entitled to receive
quarterly distributions at an annual rate of 8.05% of the liquidation preference
value of $25 per security.  We have the right to defer interest  payments on the
Subordinated   Debentures   which  would  result  in  the  similar  deferral  of
distributions  on  the  QUIPS  during  extension  periods  up to 20  consecutive
quarters. We are the owner of all the common trust securities,  which constitute
approximately  3%  of  the  aggregate   liquidation  amount  of  all  the  Trust
Securities. The sole asset of the Trust is Subordinated Debentures,  interest on
which is deductible  by us for income tax purposes.  The Trust will use interest
payments received on the Subordinated  Debentures it holds to make the quarterly
cash distributions on the QUIPS.

The QUIPS are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated
Debentures  at  maturity  or upon  redemption.  We have the option to redeem the
Subordinated Debentures upon the occurrence of certain events and, in any event,
may do so at any time on or after March 20, 2001.

We  have  guaranteed,   on  a  subordinated   basis,   payment  of  the  Trust's
obligations. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

14 SQUARE BUTTE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase  agreement with Square Butte that extends
through 2026  (Agreement).  It provides a long-term supply of low-cost energy to
customers in our electric service  territory and enables Minnesota Power to meet
power pool  reserve  requirements.  Square  Butte,  a North  Dakota  cooperative
corporation,  owns a 455-megawatt coal-fired generating unit (Unit) near Center,
North Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a generating unit owned by Minnkota Power
Cooperative, Inc. (Minnkota), a North Dakota cooperative corporation whose Class
A members are also members of Square Butte.  Minnkota  serves as the operator of
the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

Minnesota Power is entitled to approximately  71% of the Unit's output under the
Agreement.  After  2005 and  upon  compliance  with a  two-year  advance  notice
requirement,  Minnkota has the option to reduce Minnesota Power's entitlement by
5% annually,  to a minimum of 50%.  Minnesota  Power is obligated to pay its pro
rata share of Square  Butte's costs based on Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to
Unit output.  Minnesota Power's payment  obligation is suspended if Square Butte
fails to deliver any power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one
year. Square Butte's fixed costs consist primarily of debt service.  At December
31, 2000 Square Butte had total debt outstanding of $314.6 million. Total annual
debt  service for Square  Butte is expected to be  approximately  $36 million in
each of the  years  2001  through  2003 and $23  million  in both 2004 and 2005.
Variable  operating costs include the price of coal purchased from BNI Coal, our
subsidiary, under a long-term contract.

Minnesota  Power's  cost of power  purchased  from Square  Butte during 2000 was
$58.7 million  ($58.7  million in 1999;  $58.2  million in 1998).  This reflects
Minnesota  Power's pro rata share of total  Square  Butte costs based on the 71%
output entitlement in 2000, 1999 and 1998. Included in this amount was Minnesota
Power's  pro rata  share of  interest  expense of $14.8  million in 2000  ($15.5
million in 1999;  $14.6 million in 1998).  Minnesota  Power's payments to Square
Butte are approved as purchased  power expense for  ratemaking  purposes by both
the MPUC and FERC. [GRAPHIC OMITTED - SQUARE]

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS.  Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were
approximately  $27.9 million at December 31, 2000 ($19.3 million at December 31,
1999).  Foreign  undistributed   earnings  are  considered  to  be  indefinitely
reinvested and, accordingly,  we have no provision for United States federal and
state income taxes on these earnings. Upon distribution of foreign undistributed
earnings  in the form of  dividends  or  otherwise,  we would be subject to both
United States income tax (subject to an adjustment  for foreign tax credits) and
withholding taxes payable to Canada. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
deferred  United  States  income  tax  liability  is  not  practical  due to the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation; however, unrecognized
foreign tax credit  carryforwards  would be  available to reduce some portion of
the United States  liability.  Withholding  taxes of approximately  $1.4 million
would be payable  upon  remittance  of all  previously  unremitted  earnings  at
December  31,  2000 ($1.0  million at December  31,  1999).  [GRAPHIC  OMITTED -

17 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

Certain  eligible  employees  of ALLETE are covered by  noncontributory  defined
benefit pension plans. A defined  benefit plan covering  Florida Water employees
was terminated in 2000 and a $0.3 million credit was recognized  upon settlement
(curtailment  expense of $0.6 million was accrued in 1999). At December 31, 2000
approximately  10% of the defined  benefit  pension plan assets were invested in
our common stock. We have defined  contribution  pension plans covering eligible
employees,  for which the  aggregate  annual cost was $6.0 million in 2000 ($4.7
million in 1999;  $4.0 million in 1998). We provide certain health care and life
insurance  benefits  for eligible  retired  employees.  The deferred  regulatory
charge for postretirement health and life benefits was fully amortized in 1999.

The assumed  health care cost trend rate declines  gradually to an ultimate rate
of 6.0% by 2002. For postretirement  health and life benefits,  a 1% increase in
the  assumed  health care cost trend rate would  result in a $8.4  million and a
$1.1 million  increase in the benefit  obligation and total service and interest
costs,  respectively;  a 1%  decrease  would  result in a $6.9  million and $0.9
million decrease in the benefit obligation and total service and interest costs,
respectively. [GRAPHIC  OMITTED - SQUARE]

18 EMPLOYEE STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLANS

EMPLOYEE  STOCK  OWNERSHIP  PLAN. We sponsor an Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan
(ESOP) with two leveraged accounts.

A 1989 leveraged ESOP account covers certain eligible nonunion ALLETE employees.
The ESOP used the proceeds  from a $16.5 million loan (15 year term at 9.125%),
guaranteed by us, to purchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock on the open
market. These shares fund an annual benefit of not less than 2% of participants'
salaries.

A 1990  leveraged  ESOP account covers  certain  eligible  ALLETE  employees who
participated  in the  non-leveraged  ESOP plan prior to August 1989. In 1990 the
ESOP issued a $75 million  note (term not to exceed 25 years at 10.25%) to us as
consideration  for 5.6 million  shares of our newly issued common  stock.  These
shares  are used to fund an annual  benefit  at least  equal to the value of (a)
dividends on shares held in the 1990  leveraged ESOP which are used to make loan
payments, and (b) tax benefits obtained from deducting eligible dividends.

The loans will be repaid with  dividends  received by the ESOP and with employer
contributions.  ESOP shares  acquired with the loans were  initially  pledged as
collateral  for the loans.  The ESOP shares are  released  from  collateral  and
allocated to participants based on the portion of total debt service paid in the
year.  The ESOP  shares  that  collateralize  the loans are not  included in the
number of average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share.

EMPLOYEE  STOCK  PURCHASE  PLAN.  We have an Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan that
permits eligible  employees to buy up to $23,750 per year of our common stock at
95% of the market  price.  At December  31,  2000,  1.1 million  shares had been
issued  under the plan and  156,919  shares  were  held in  reserve  for  future
issuance.

STOCK  OPTION  AND  AWARD  PLANS.  We  have  an  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
Compensation Plan (Executive Plan) and a Director Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan
(Director  Plan).  The Executive  Plan allows for the grant of up to 6.7 million
shares of our common stock to key  employees.  To date,  these grants have taken
the form of stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock awards.
The Director Plan allows for the grant of up to 0.3 million shares of our common
stock to nonemployee  directors.  Each nonemployee  director  receives an annual
grant of 1,500 stock options and a biennial grant of performance shares equal to
$10,000  in  value of  common  stock at the date of  grant.  Stock  options  are
exercisable  at the market  price of common  shares on the date the  options are
granted,  and vest in equal annual  installments  over two years with expiration
ten years from the date of grant.  Performance shares are earned over multi-year
time periods and are contingent upon the attainment of certain performance goals
of ALLETE. Restricted stock vests once certain periods of time have elapsed.

We have elected to account for our stock-based  compensation plans in accordance
with the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees," and accordingly, compensation expense has not been recognized for
stock  options  granted.  Compensation  expense is  recognized  over the vesting
periods for performance and restricted share awards based on the market value of
our common stock,  and was  approximately $5 million in 2000 ($3 million in 1999
and in  1998).  Pro forma net  income  and  earnings  per share  under  SFAS 123
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"  have not been presented because such
amounts are not materially different from actual amounts reported.  This may not
be representative of the pro forma effects for future years if additional awards
are granted.

in such capacity,  the  "SERVICER")  and BANK OF MONTREAL,  CHICAGO  BRANCH,  as
lender (together with its successors and permitted assigns, the "LENDER").

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

        Certain terms that are  capitalized  and used throughout this Agreement
are defined in EXHIBIT I to this Agreement. References in the Exhibits hereto to
"the Agreement"  refer to this Agreement,  as amended,  modified or supplemented

        1.      Borrower has purchased and will purchase from time to time

        2.      Borrower  intends to finance the  Receivables  by  borrowing
Loans from the Lender.  Borrower has  requested  Lender,  and Lender has agreed,

will be secured by such Receivables and other Collateral.

        3.      AFC has been requested, and is willing, to act as the Servicer
with respect to the Receivables.

        In consideration of the mutual  agreements,  provisions and covenants

                                   ARTICLE I.

                                      LOANS

        Section 1.1. COMMITMENTS  TO LEND;  LIMITS ON LENDER'S  OBLIGATIONS.
Upon the terms and subject to the  conditions  of this  Agreement,  from time to
time prior to the Termination Date,  Borrower may request that Lender make loans

on or before the requested  Financing  Date,  which notice shall specify (A) the
amount  requested  to be  borrowed  by  the  Borrower  (which  amount  shall  be
$1,000,000 or in integral $100,000 multiples thereof),  and (B) the date of such
Loan (which shall be a Business Day).

        (b)     FUNDING OF LOAN. On the date of each Loan, upon satisfaction of

                The "BORROWING  BASE" means,  as of any Financing  Date,  with
        respect to the  Financed  Vehicle  Pool to be financed by a Loan on such
        date,  the sum of (i) 60% of the  aggregate  Black  Book  Value  of such

        (ii) the Credit Account Adjustment Amount.

                The "ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" means, as of any Financing Date, with

        date,  (i) so long as no  Trigger  Event has  occurred,  zero,  and (ii)
        following  the  occurrence  of a Trigger  Event,  an amount equal to the
        product of (x) aggregate Black Book Value of such Financed  Vehicle Pool
        as of such date, and (y) the largest  percentage by which the Black Book

<PAGE>

                        (b)     on any Payment Date following the occurrence of
                an Event  of  Default,  an  amount  which is equal to the  Total
                Outstanding  Principal on such Payment Date (after giving effect

                        (i)     if on any day the outstanding balance of any
                Receivable is reduced or adjusted as a result of any  adjustment
                made by AFC,  the  Borrower  or the  Servicer,  or any setoff or
                dispute between the Borrower, AFC, the Servicer and the Obligor,
                the  Borrower  shall be  deemed to have  received  on such day a
                Collection of such Receivable in the amount of such reduction or
                adjustment;

                        (ii)    if on any  day  any of the  representations  or

                to have received on such day a Collection of such  Receivable in
                full;

                        (iii)   if and to  the  extent  the  Lender  shall  be
                required  for any  reason  to pay  over to the  Obligor  (or any
                trustee,   receiver,   custodian  or  similar  official  in  any
                Insolvency Proceeding) any amount received by it hereunder, such
                amount  shall be deemed not to have been so received  but rather
                to have been  retained by the  Borrower  and,  accordingly,  the
                Lender,  as the  case may be,  shall  have a claim  against  the
                Borrower  for such  amount,  payable when and to the extent that
                any  distribution  from or on behalf of such  Obligor is made in
                respect thereof.

        (h)     CREDIT ACCOUNT.  Until the distribution of all remaining amounts
in the Collection  Account pursuant to SECTION 1.4(f),  the Borrower (subject to
the  Lender's  audit and  approval)  shall  maintain a book entry  account  (the
"CREDIT  ACCOUNT") for the purpose of recording the amount of Collections  which
represents  a credit to the  Borrower  against  which the  Borrower  can  borrow
additional amounts hereunder.  On any day the balance of the Credit Account (the
"CREDIT  ACCOUNT   BALANCE")  shall  equal  (i)  the  aggregate  amount  of  all
Collections  applied to reduce the  principal  balance of the Loans  pursuant to
CLAUSE (a)(y) of the definition of "Mandatory Principal Repayment

                                      -5-

SECTION 1 of EXHIBIT II, as such letter  agreement may be amended,  supplemented
or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof.

        Section  1.6.  PAYMENTS AND  COMPUTATIONS,  ETC. (a) All amounts to be
paid or deposited by the  Borrower or the  Servicer  hereunder  shall be paid or
deposited in accordance  with the terms hereof no later than noon (Chicago time)

on any amount not paid or  deposited by the Borrower or Servicer to the Lender's
Account when due  hereunder,  at an interest  rate equal to 2.0% PER ANNUM above
the Base Rate, payable on demand.

        (c)     All  computations  of interest  under  SUBSECTION (b) above and
all computations of fees and other amounts  hereunder shall be made on the basis
of a year of 360  days for the  actual  number  of days  elapsed.  Whenever  any
payment  or  deposit  to be made  hereunder  shall be due on a day other  than a
Business  Day,  such  payment  or  deposit  shall be made no later than the next
succeeding  Business  Day and such  extension  of time shall be  included in the
computation of such payment or deposit.

        Section 1.7.  INCREASED COSTS.  (a) If the Lender,  any Participant or
any of their respective  Affiliates (each an "AFFECTED PERSON")  determines that
the  existence of or  compliance  with (i) any law or  regulation  or any change
therein or in the interpretation or application  thereof,  in each case adopted,
issued or  occurring  after the date hereof or (ii) any  request,  guideline  or
directive from any central bank or other Governmental  Authority (whether or not
having the force of law) issued or  occurring  after the date of this  Agreement
affects  or would  affect  the  amount of capital  required  or  expected  to be
maintained by such Affected Person and such Affected Person  determines that the
amount of such  capital  is  increased  by or based  upon the  existence  of any
commitment to make a Loan hereunder  then,  upon demand by such Affected  Person
(with a copy to the  Lender  if such  Affected  Person is not the  Lender),  the
Borrower shall  immediately pay to the Lender,  for the account of such Affected
Person,  from time to time as  specified  by such  Affected  Person,  additional
amounts  sufficient  to  compensate  such  Affected  Person in the light of such
circumstances,  to the extent that such Affected  Person  reasonably  determines
such  increase  in  capital  to be  allocable  to the  existence  of any of such
commitments;  PROVIDED that within 30 days of an Affected  Party's  knowledge of
any such  circumstance such Affected Party shall notify the Borrower of the same
and whether such Affected Party will request that the Borrower  indemnify it for
such  circumstance.  A

                                      -6-

certificate as to such amounts  submitted to the Borrower and the Lender by such
Affected  Person  shall be  conclusive  and  binding  for all  purposes,  absent
manifest error.

        (b)     If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other
than any  change  by way of  imposition  or  increase  of  reserve  requirements
referred to in SECTION 1.9) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation
or (ii)  compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
Governmental  Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Affected Person of funding or maintaining a Loan
or portion of a Loan in respect of which  interest is computed by  reference  to
the Cost of Funds, then, upon demand by such Affected Person, the Borrower shall
immediately  pay to such  Affected  Person,  from  time  to  time as  specified,
additional  amounts  sufficient  to  compensate  such  Affected  Person for such
increased costs;  PROVIDED that within 30 days of an Affected Party's  knowledge
of any such  circumstance  such Affected  Party shall notify the Borrower of the
same and whether such Affected Party will request that the Borrower indemnify it
for  such  circumstance.  A  certificate  as to such  amounts  submitted  to the
Borrower  by such  Affected  Person  shall be  conclusive  and  binding  for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

        Section 1.8.  ADDITIONAL  INTEREST ON LOANS BEARING  INTEREST BASED ON
COST OF FUNDS.  The Borrower shall pay to any Affected  Person,  so long as such
Affected Person shall be required under regulations of the Board of Governors of
the Federal  Reserve System to maintain  reserves with respect to liabilities or
assets  consisting  of  or  including  "Eurocurrency  Liabilities",   additional
interest on the Loan during each Interest Period in respect of which interest is
computed by reference to the Cost of Funds, for such Interest Period,  at a rate
per annum  equal at all  times  during  such  Interest  Period to the  remainder
obtained by subtracting (i) the Cost of Funds for such Interest Period from (ii)
the rate obtained by dividing such Cost of Funds referred to in CLAUSE (i) above
by that percentage  equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar  Rate Reserve  Percentage
for such Interest  Period,  payable on each date on which interest is payable on
the  applicable  Portion  of  Investment;  PROVIDED  that  within  30 days of an
Affected Party's  knowledge of any such  circumstance  such Affected Party shall
notify the  Borrower of the same and whether  such  Affected  Party will request
that the Borrower indemnify it for such circumstance.  Such additional  interest
shall be determined by the Affected Person and notified to the Borrower  through
the Lender.  A  certificate  as to such  additional  interest  submitted  to the
Borrower  by the  Affected  Person  shall  be  conclusive  and  binding  for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

        Section  1.9.  REQUIREMENTS  OF LAW.  In the event  that any  Affected
Person  determines  that  the  existence  of or  compliance  with (i) any law or
regulation  or any  change  therein  or in  the  interpretation  or  application
thereof, in each case adopted, issued or occurring after the date hereof or (ii)
any request,  guideline or directive from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority (whether or not having the force of law) issued or occurring after the
date of this Agreement:

                (i)     does or shall subject such  Affected  Person to any tax
        of any kind whatsoever  with respect to this Agreement,  any increase in
        the  Total  Outstanding  Principal  relating  thereto,  or does or shall
        change the basis of  taxation of  payments  to such  Affected  Person on
        account of Collections,  interest or any other amounts payable hereunder
        (excluding  taxes

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

        imposed on the overall net income of such Affected Person, and franchise
        taxes imposed on such Affected  Person,  by the  jurisdiction  under the
        laws  of  which  such  Affected  Person  is  organized  or  a  political
        subdivision thereof);

                (ii)    does or shall  impose,  modify  or hold  applicable  any
        reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against
        assets held by, or deposits or other  liabilities  in or for the account
        of  advances  or loans by,  or other  credit  extended  by, or any other
        acquisition  of funds by, any office of such  Affected  Person which are
        not otherwise  included in the determination of the Cost of Funds or the
        Base Rate hereunder; or

                (iii)   does or shall impose on such Affected Person any other
        condition;

and the  result  of any of the  foregoing  is (x) to  increase  the cost to such
Affected Person of making a Loan, or of agreeing to fund or maintain any Loan or
(y) to reduce any amount receivable  hereunder (whether directly or indirectly),
then, in any such case,  upon demand by such Affected  Person the Borrower shall
pay such Affected  Person any additional  amounts  necessary to compensate  such
Affected Person for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable.  All such
amounts shall be payable as incurred. A certificate from such Affected Person to
the  Borrower  certifying,   in  reasonably  specific  detail,  the  basis  for,
calculation of, and amount of such additional costs or reduced amount receivable
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error; PROVIDED, however, that no
Affected  Person shall be required to disclose any  confidential or tax planning
information in any such certificate.

        Section 1.10.  INABILITY TO DETERMINE COST OF FUNDS. In the event that
the Lender shall have  determined  prior to the first day of any Interest Period
(which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto) by
reason of circumstances  affecting the interbank  Eurodollar market,  either (a)
dollar deposits in the relevant amounts and for the relevant Interest Period are
not available,  (b) adequate and reasonable  means do not exist for ascertaining
the Cost of Funds for such Interest  Period or (c) the Cost of Funds  determined
pursuant  hereto  does  not  accurately  reflect  the  cost  to the  Lender  (as
conclusively  determined  by the  Lender) of  maintaining  any Loan  during such
Interest  Period,  the Lender  shall  promptly  give  telephonic  notice of such
determination,  confirmed in writing,  to the Borrower prior to the first day of
such Interest  Period.  Upon delivery of such notice (a) no Loan or portion of a
Loan shall be funded  thereafter at the Bank Rate determined by reference to the
Cost of Funds,  unless  and until the  Lender  shall  have  given  notice to the
Borrower  that the  circumstances  giving rise to such  determination  no longer
exist, and (b) with respect to any outstanding  Loans or portions of a Loan then
funded at the Bank Rate determined by reference to the Cost of Funds,  such Bank
Rate shall  automatically  be converted to the Bank Rate determined by reference
to the  Base  Rate at the  respective  last  days of the  then-current  Interest
Periods relating to such Loans or portions of a Loan.

        Section 1.11.   FUNDING  LOSSES.  In the event that any Affected Person
shall  incur any loss or expense  (including,  without  limitation,  any loss or
expense  incurred by reason of the  liquidation or  reemployment  of deposits or
other funds acquired by such Affected  Person to make or maintain any Loan) as a
result of (i) any  settlement  with  respect  to any Loan  being made on any day
other than

                                       -8-
<PAGE>

the  applicable  Payment Date with respect  thereto,  or (ii) any Loan not being
made in accordance with a request therefor under SECTION 1.2(a), then, within 30
days of written notice from such Affected Person to Borrower, Borrower shall pay
to such Affected Person the amount of such loss or expense.  Such written notice
(which shall include calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE II.

                                    THE NOTE

        Section 2.1.  NOTE.  The Loans shall be evidenced by a promissory  note
(as from time to time supplemented,  extended,  amended or replaced, the "NOTE")
in form and substance acceptable to the Lender,  dated the date hereof,  payable
to the order of Lender in the maximum  principal  amount of $60,000,000  (or, if
less,  in the  aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount of all of the  Loans) on the
Maturity  Date.  Principal  of the Loans  shall be paid from time to time as set
forth in SECTION 2.3. The Lender shall record in its records the date and amount
of each Loan made  hereunder,  the  interest  rate with  respect  thereto,  each
repayment thereof, and the other information provided for thereon. The aggregate
unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be rebuttable  presumptive evidence of
the principal  amount owing and unpaid on the Note. The failure so to record any
such  information or any error in so recording any such  information  shall not,
however,  limit or otherwise affect the actual obligations of Borrower hereunder
or under the Note to repay the principal amount of all Loans,  together with all
interest accruing thereon, as set forth in this Agreement.

        Section 2.2.  INTEREST ON LOANS.

        (a)     INTEREST RATES. Each Loan shall accrue interest during each
Collection Period at the Bank Rate.

                (i)     on the Maturity Date;

                (ii)    on each Payment Date;

                (iii)   on or before the last day of each Interest Period;

                (iv)    on the date of any prepayment,  in whole or in part, of
        the  outstanding  principal of such Loan pursuant to SECTIONS  2.3(b) to
        the extent of the amount being prepaid; and

                (v)     on the date of the Maturity Date of any Loan which is

        (a)     may,  from time to time on any  Business  Day with  respect  to
any Loan, make a prepayment,  in whole or in part, of the outstanding  principal
amount of any such Loan; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that

                (i)     all such  voluntary  prepayments shall  require at least
        one (1) but no more than ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice to
        the Lender; and

                (ii)    all such voluntary partial  prepayments shall be in
        a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and an integral multiple of $100,000, and
        the Total  Outstanding  Principal after giving effect to such prepayment
        shall be not less than $2,000,000;

        (b)     shall,  on each  date when any reduction  in the  Facility Limit
becomes effective  pursuant to SECTION 2.5, make a prepayment of the Loans in an
amount  equal to the excess,  if any,  of the  aggregate  outstanding  principal
amount of the Loans over the Facility Limit as so reduced; and

        (c)     shall,  immediately  upon any  acceleration of the Maturity Date
of any Loans pursuant to SECTION 3.2, repay such Loans.

        Each such prepayment (i) shall be subject to the payment of any amounts
required by Section 1.11  resulting from a prepayment or payment of a Loan prior
to the Payment Date with respect  thereto,  and (ii) may be made from amounts on
deposit in the Collection Account.

        Section 2.4.  GENERAL  PROCEDURES.  No outstanding  principal  shall be
considered  reduced by any  allocation,  setting  aside or  distribution  of any
portion  of  Collections  unless  such  Collections  shall  have  been  actually
delivered to the Lender for the purpose of paying such  principal.  No principal
or  interest  shall be  considered  paid by any  distribution  of any portion of
Collections if at any time such  distribution  is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned  for any reason.  No  provision  of this  Agreement  shall  require the
payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the maximum  permitted
by applicable law.

        Section 2.5.  REDUCTION IN FACILITY  LIMIT.  The unused  portion of the
Facility  Limit may be  decreased  by an amount of  $10,000,000  or any integral
multiple of  $1,000,000 in excess  thereof upon 10 Business  Days' prior written
notice by Borrower to the Lender;  PROVIDED the Facility Limit shall in no event
be less than $10,000,000.

Lender)  prior to such sale  shall be  adequate  and  reasonable  notice for all
purposes).

hereby agrees to indemnify each  Indemnified  Party from and against any and all
claims,  damages,  expenses,  losses and liabilities  (including Attorney Costs)
(all of the foregoing being collectively  referred to as "INDEMNIFIED  AMOUNTS")
arising out of or resulting from this Agreement or other  Transaction  Documents
(whether  directly or  indirectly)  or the funding of the Loans or in respect of
any Receivable regardless of whether any such Indemnified Amounts result from an
Indemnified Party's negligence or strict liability or other acts or omissions of
an Indemnified Party, excluding,  however, (a) Indemnified Amounts to the extent
resulting  from  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  on the part of such
Indemnified  Party,  or (b) any  overall  net income  taxes or  franchise  taxes

        Document to have been true and correct in all respects when made;

                (iii)   the  failure  by  the   Borrower  to  comply  with  any
        applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable or the

        as a result of an act of the  Lender,  whether  existing at the time any
        Loan is made hereunder or at any time thereafter;

                (v)     the  failure  to  have  filed, or any  delay in  filing,

        to any item of Collateral,  whether at the time of any Loan hereunder or
        at any subsequent time;

                (vi)    any  dispute,  claim,  offset  or  defense  (other  than
        discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of
        any Receivable (including,  without limitation,  a defense based on such
        Receivable  or the Isuzu  Loan  Documents  not being a legal,  valid and
        binding obligation of such Obligor  enforceable against it in accordance
        with its terms),  or any other claim  resulting  from or relating to the
        transaction giving rise to such Receivable

        or relating to collection activities with respect to such Receivable (if
        such collection  activities were performed by the Borrower or any of its
        Affiliates acting as Servicer or by any agent or independent  contractor
        retained by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates);

                (vii)   any failure of the Borrower to perform its duties or

        Financed  Vehicles,  other  goods,  insurance  or services  that are the
        subject of or secure any Receivable;

                (ix)   the  commingling  of  Collections  of  Receivables at any
        time with other funds;

        to this  Agreement  or the  funding  of the Loans or in  respect  of any
        Receivable or other item of Collateral or the Isuzu Loan Documents;

                (xi)    any  reduction  in the Total  Outstanding  Principal as
        a result of the distribution of Collections  pursuant to SECTION 1.4(d),
        in  the  event  that  all  or a  portion  of  such  distributions  shall
        thereafter be rescinded or otherwise must be returned for any reason; or

                (xii)   any tax or  governmental  fee or charge  (other than any
        tax upon or measured by net income or gross receipts),  all interest and
        penalties   thereon  or  with  respect   thereto,   and  all  reasonable
        out-of-pocket  costs and  expenses,  including the  reasonable  fees and
        expenses of counsel in  defending  against the same,  which may arise by
        reason of funding or maintaining the Loans.

        If for any reason the  indemnification  provided  above in this  SECTION
4.1 is  unavailable  to an  Indemnified  Party or is  insufficient  to hold such
Indemnified  Party  harmless,   then  the  Borrower  shall  contribute  to  such
Indemnified  Party the amount otherwise  payable by such Indemnified  Party as a
result of such loss, claim,  damage or liability to the maximum extent permitted
under applicable law.

hereby agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party, forthwith on demand, from and
against  any and  all  Indemnified  Amounts,  regardless  of  whether  any  such
Indemnified  Amounts  result from an  Indemnified  Party's  negligence or strict
liability or other acts or omissions of an Indemnified Party, awarded against or
incurred by any of them arising out of or relating to:

                (i)     the failure of any Receivable to be an Eligible
        Receivable  as of  the  related  Financing  Date,  the  failure  of  any
        information contained in a Portfolio Certificate to be true and correct,
        or the  failure of any other  information  provided  to the Lender  with

                (ii)    any  representation or warranty  made by AFC under or in
        connection with any Transaction  Document in its capacity as Servicer or
        any  information  or  report  delivered  by or on  behalf  of AFC in its
        capacity  as  Servicer  pursuant  hereto,  which  shall have been false,
        incorrect  or  misleading  in any  material  respect when made or deemed
        made;

                (iii)   the failure by AFC,  in its  capacity  as  Servicer,  to
        comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation  (including  truth in
        lending, fair credit billing, usury, fair credit reporting, equal credit
        opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy) with respect to
        any Receivable or the Isuzu Loan Documents; or

                (iv)    any failure of Servicer to perform its duties, covenants
        and  obligations in accordance  with the  applicable  provisions of this
        Agreement.

        If for any reason the  indemnification  provided  above in this SECTION
4.2 is  unavailable  to an  Indemnified  Party or is  insufficient  to hold such
Indemnified  Party harmless,  then Servicer shall contribute to such Indemnified
Party the amount otherwise payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
loss,  claim,  damage  or  liability  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  under
applicable law.


                                  ARTICLE V.

                         ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTIONS

        Section 5.1.  APPOINTMENT  OF SERVICER. (a) The servicing, administering
and collection of the Receivables shall be conducted by the Person so designated
from time to time as Servicer in  accordance  with this SECTION  5.1.  Until the
Lender gives notice to the  Borrower and the Servicer (in  accordance  with this
SECTION 5.1) of the designation of a new Servicer,  AFC is hereby designated as,
and  hereby  agrees to  perform  the duties  and  obligations  of, the  Servicer
pursuant to the terms hereof.  Upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default,  the
Lender may  designate as Servicer any Person  (including  itself) to succeed the
Servicer or any successor Servicer,  on the condition in each case that any such
Person so designated  shall agree to perform the duties and  obligations  of the
Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof.

        (b)     Upon the  designation  of a successor  Servicer  as set forth in
SECTION 5.1(a) hereof, the Servicer agrees that it will terminate its activities
as Servicer  hereunder in a manner which the Lender  determines  will facilitate
the transition of the  performance of such  activities to the new Servicer,  and
the Servicer shall cooperate with and assist such new Servicer. Such cooperation
shall include (without  limitation) access to and transfer of records and use by
the new Servicer of all licenses, hardware or software necessary or desirable to
collect the  Receivables  and any Related  Security;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,  Servicer's grant of a license,
further described below, to the Lender or any new Servicer,  shall be a limited,
non-exclusive,  non-transferable,  non-assignable,  license  to  access  and use
(reproduce,  transmit,  display and perform) the software  developed by Servicer
commonly  known as "COSMOS,"  residing on

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

Servicer's server computer commonly known as "AFC1," (or any successor  software
or hardware used by the Servicer)  via either  Servicer's,  Lender's or such new
Servicer's  workstations,  at the Lender's discretion (the "LICENSED  SOFTWARE")
solely for the limited  purpose of collecting on the Receivables and any Related
Security. No license or right to use, reproduce,  distribute,  display publicly,
perform  publicly,  transmit  or create  derivative  works based upon any of the
Licensed Software is granted to either the Lender or any new Servicer, except as
expressly provided in this paragraph.  Neither Lender nor any new Servicer shall
or permit any third party to, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, recompile,
update or modify all or any part of the Licensed Software.

        (c)     The Servicer acknowledges that, in making their decision to
execute  and deliver  this  Agreement,  the Lender has relied on the  Servicer's
agreement to act as Servicer hereunder. Accordingly, the Servicer agrees that it
will not voluntarily resign as Servicer.

        (d)     The Servicer may delegate its duties and  obligations  hereunder
to any  subservicer  (each,  a  "SUB-SERVICER");  provided  that,  in each  such
delegation,  (i) such Sub-Servicer  shall agree in writing to perform the duties
and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof,  (ii) the Servicer
shall remain  primarily  liable to the Lender for the  performance of the duties
and  obligations so delegated,  (iii) the Borrower and the Lender shall have the
right to look solely to the Servicer for such  performance and (iv) the terms of
any agreement with any Sub-Servicer  shall provide that the Lender may terminate
such agreement upon the  termination of the Servicer in accordance  with SECTION
5.1(a)  above  hereunder  by giving  notice  of its  desire  to  terminate  such
agreement to the Servicer (and the Servicer shall provide  appropriate notice to
such Sub-Servicer).

        Section 5.2.  DUTIES OF SERVICER.  (a) The Servicer shall take or cause
to be taken all such action as may be  necessary  or  advisable  to collect each
Receivable  from time to time, all in accordance  with this  Agreement,  the
other  Transaction  Documents  (including,  without  limitation,  the Isuzu Loan
Documents) and all applicable laws, rules and regulations,  with reasonable care
and diligence. The Borrower shall deliver to the Servicer and the Servicer shall
hold for the benefit of the  Borrower  and the Lender in  accordance  with their
respective  interests,  all records and documents  (including without limitation
computer  tapes or  disks)  with  respect  to each  Receivable.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Lender may direct the Servicer to
commence or settle any legal action to enforce  collection of any  Receivable or
to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
such direction may be given unless an Event of Default has occurred.

        (b)     The Servicer's obligations hereunder shall terminate on the
Final Payout Date.

        After such  termination,  the Servicer  shall  promptly  deliver to the
Borrower all books,  records and related materials that the Borrower  previously
provided to the Servicer in connection with this Agreement.

        Section 5.3.  ESTABLISHMENT AND USE OF COLLECTION ACCOUNT.

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

        (a)     The  Servicer  agrees to  establish  the  Collection  Account on
or before the date of the first Loan hereunder.  The Collection Account shall be
used to accept and hold Collections and for such other purposes described in the
Transaction Documents.

        (b)     The  Servicer  agrees to  transfer ownership  and control of the
Collection  Account to the Borrower on or before the Closing Date.  The Borrower
agrees that if the Lender so requests it shall grant a valid perfected  security
interest  in the  Collection  Account to the Lender  pursuant  to  documentation
satisfactory to the Lender.

        (c)     Any  amounts  in the Collection  Account may be  invested by the
Collection Account Bank, at Servicer's direction,  in Permitted Investments,  so
long as Lender's interest in such Permitted Investments is perfected in a manner
satisfactory to Lender and such Permitted  Investments are subject to no Adverse
Claims.

        (d)     The Lender may  following any Event of  Default (or an Unmatured
Event of Default of the type  described  in  PARAGRAPH  (g) of EXHIBIT V) at any
time give notice to the  Collection  Account Bank that the Lender is  exercising
its  rights  under  the  Collection  Account  Agreement  to do any or all of the
following:  (i) to have the exclusive  ownership  and control of the  Collection
Account transferred to the Lender and to exercise exclusive dominion and control
over the  funds  deposited  therein  and (ii) to take any or all  other  actions
permitted  under the Collection  Account  Agreement.  The Borrower hereby agrees
that if the  Lender at any time  takes  any  action  set forth in the  preceding
sentence,  the Lender shall have  exclusive  control of the proceeds  (including
Collections)  of all  Receivables and the Borrower hereby further agrees to take
any other  action  that the  Lender may  reasonably  request  to  transfer  such
control.  Any proceeds of Receivables  received by the Borrower,  as Servicer or
otherwise,  thereafter  shall be sent  immediately  to the  Lender.  The parties
hereto  hereby  acknowledge  that if at any time the Lender takes control of the
Collection Account, the Lender shall not have any rights to the funds therein in
excess of the unpaid amounts due to the Lender or any other Person hereunder.

        (e)     Until the Final Payment Date, no funds may be withdrawn from the
Collection Account except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

        Section 5.4.  ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS. (a) At any time following the
occurrence of an Event of Default:

                (i)     the Lender may direct the Obligor that payment of all
        amounts  payable under any  Receivable be made directly to the Lender or
        its designee;

                (ii)    the Lender may  instruct the Borrower or the Servicer to
        give notice of the  Lender's  interest in  Receivables  to the  Obligor,
        which notice shall direct that  payments be made  directly to the Lender
        or its designee, and upon such instruction from the Lender, the Borrower
        or the Servicer, as applicable, shall give such notice at the expense of
        the Borrower; PROVIDED, that if the Borrower or the Servicer fails to so
        notify the Obligor, the Lender may so notify the Obligor; and

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

                (iii)   the Lender may request the  Borrower or the Servicer to,
        and upon such  request the  Borrower  or the  Servicer,  as  applicable,
        shall, (A) assemble all of the records necessary or desirable to collect
        the Receivables and the Related Security, and transfer or license to any
        new Servicer  the use of all software  necessary or desirable to collect
        the Receivables and the Related Security, and make the same available to
        the Lender or its  designee at a place  selected by the Lender,  and (B)
        segregate  all cash,  checks and other  instruments  received by it from
        time to time constituting Collections with respect to the Receivables in
        a manner acceptable to the Lender and, promptly upon receipt,  remit all
        such cash,  checks and instruments,  duly endorsed or with duly executed
        instruments of transfer, to the Lender or its designee.

        (b)     The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender, and irrevocably
appoints the Lender as its attorney-in-fact  with full power of substitution and
with full authority in the place and stead of the Borrower, which appointment is
coupled with an interest,  to take any and all steps in the name of the Borrower

                  (e)      There is no pending  or  threatened  action or
proceeding   affecting  the  Servicer  before  any  Governmental   Authority  or
arbitrator which could have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f)      The Servicer has complied in all material respects
with the Isuzu Loan Documents.

                                   EXHIBIT IV

                                    COVENANTS


         COVENANTS  OF THE BORROWER  AND THE  SERVICER.  Until the latest of the
Termination Date, the date on which no Loan shall be outstanding or the date all
other  amounts  owed by the Borrower  under the  Agreement to the Lender and any
other Indemnified Party or Affected Person shall be paid in full:

                  (a)      COMPLIANCE  WITH LAWS,  ETC. Each of the Borrower and
the Servicer  shall comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  laws,
rules,   regulations  and  orders,  and  preserve  and  maintain  its  corporate
existence,  rights,  franchises,  qualifications,  and privileges  except to the
extent that the failure so to comply with such laws,  rules and  regulations  or
the failure so to preserve  and maintain  such  existence,  rights,  franchises,
qualifications,  and  privileges  would  not  materially  adversely  affect  the
collectibility  of the  Receivables  or the  enforceability  of the  Isuzu  Loan
Documents  or the  ability  of the  Borrower  or the  Servicer  to  perform  its
obligations under any Transaction Document to which it is a party.

                  (b)      OFFICES,  RECORDS AND BOOKS OF ACCOUNT,  ETC. The
Borrower  (i) shall keep its  principal  place of business  and chief  executive
office  (as such  terms are used in the UCC) and the  office  where it keeps its
records  concerning  the  Receivables  at the address of the  Borrower set forth
under its name on the signature page to the Agreement or, upon at least 60 days'
prior written notice of a proposed change to the Lender,  at any other locations
in jurisdictions where all actions reasonably requested by the Lender to protect
and perfect the  security  interest  of the Lender in the  Collateral  have been
taken and  completed  and (ii) shall  provide  the Lender with at least 60 days'
written notice prior to making any change in the  Borrower's  name or making any
other  change in the  Borrower's  identity or corporate  structure  (including a
merger) which could render any UCC financing  statement filed in connection with
this  Agreement  "seriously  misleading"  as such term is used in the UCC;  each
notice to the Lender  pursuant to this sentence  shall set forth the  applicable
change and the  effective  date  thereof.  The Borrower  and Servicer  also will
maintain and  implement  administrative  and  operating  procedures  (including,
without limitation, an ability to recreate records evidencing Receivables in the
event of the  destruction of the originals  thereof),  and keep and maintain all
documents,  books,  records,  computer  tapes and  disks  and other  information
reasonably  necessary  or  advisable  for  the  collection  of  all  Receivables
(including,   without   limitation,   records   adequate  to  permit  the  daily
identification of each Receivable and all Collections of and adjustments to each
existing Receivable).

                  (c)      [RESERVED]

                  (d)      SECURITY INTEREST, ETC. The  Borrower shall,  at  its
expense,  take all action  necessary or  desirable  to establish  and maintain a
first-priority, perfected security interest in the Collateral, free and clear of
any Adverse Claim, in favor of the Lender, including, without limitation,

                                      IV-1
<PAGE>

taking such  action to  perfect,  protect or more fully  evidence  the  security
interest of the Lender under the Agreement as the Lender may request.

                  (e)      SALES, LIENS, ETC. The Borrower shall not sell,
assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise  dispose of, or create or
suffer to exist any  Adverse  Claim upon or with  respect  to, any or all of its
right,  title or  interest  in,  to or under any item of  Collateral  (including
without limitation the Borrower's undivided interest in any Receivable,  Related
Security,  or  Collections,  or upon or with respect to any account to which any
Collections of any  Receivables are sent), or assign any right to receive income
in respect of any items contemplated by this PARAGRAPH (e).

                  (f)      CHANGE IN BUSINESS.  Neither the Borrower nor the
Servicer  shall make any material  change in the  character of its business that
would   adversely   affect  the   collectibility   of  the  Receivables  or  the
enforceability  of the Isuzu Loan  Documents  or the ability of the  Borrower or
Servicer to perform its obligations  under any Transaction  Document to which it
is a party.

                  (g)      AUDITS.  Each of the Borrower and the Servicer shall,
from time to time during  regular  business  hours as  requested  by the Lender,
permit the  Lender,  or its agents or  representatives,  (i) to examine and make
copies of and  abstracts  from all  books,  records  and  documents  (including,
without  limitation,  computer  tapes and disks) in the  possession or under the
control of the Borrower or the Servicer  relating to Receivables and the Related
Security,  including,  without limitation, the Isuzu Loan Documents, and (ii) to
visit the  offices and  properties  of the  Borrower  and the  Servicer  for the
purpose of  examining  such  materials  described  in CLAUSE  (i) above,  and to
discuss  matters  relating  to  Receivables  and  the  Related  Security  or the
Borrower's or Servicer's performance hereunder or under the Isuzu Loan Documents
with any of the  officers,  employees,  agents or  contractors  of the  Borrower
having  knowledge of such matters;  PROVIDED that so long as no Event of Default
or  Unmatured  Event of Default has  occurred  the Lender shall not conduct more
than one such examination in any year.

                  (h)      CHANGE IN COLLECTION ACCOUNT BANK AND PAYMENT
INSTRUCTIONS  TO  OBLIGOR.  Without  the prior  written  consent of the  Lender,
neither the Borrower nor the Servicer  shall (x) add or terminate  any bank as a
Collection  Account  Bank,  or (y)  instruct the Obligor to make  payments  with
respect to the Receivables to any account other than the Collection  Account (or
any substitute  account  approved by the Lender in advance and made subject to a
Collection Account Agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Lender).

                  (i)      COLLECTION  ACCOUNT.  The Collection Account shall at
all times be subject to the Collection Account  Agreement.  Neither the Borrower
nor the Servicer will deposit or otherwise  credit,  or cause or permit to be so
deposited or credited,  to the  Collection  Account cash or cash proceeds  other
than Collections of Receivables.

                  (j) MARKING OF RECORDS.  At its expense,  the Borrower (or the
Servicer on its behalf) shall mark its master data processing  records  relating
to Receivables and the Isuzu Loan

                                      IV-2
<PAGE>

Documents,  including  with  a  legend  evidencing  that  such  Receivables  and
documents  are subject to the  security  interest of the Lender  pursuant to the
Agreement.

                  (k)      REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  The Borrower will provide to
the Lender (in multiple  copies,  if requested by the Lender)  (except that with
respect to PARAGRAPH  (iii),  the Borrower will cause the Servicer to provide to
the Lender and the Servicer will deliver to the Lender) the following:

                           (i)    as soon as  available  and in any event within
             45 days after the end of the first  three  quarters  of each fiscal

             of such Person;

                           (ii)   as soon as available and in any event within

             three  days  after the  occurrence  of each  Event of  Default  and
             Unmatured  Event of  Default,  a statement  of the chief  financial
             officer  of the  Borrower  setting  forth  details of such Event of
             Default or event and the  action  that the  Borrower  has taken and
             proposes to take with respect thereto;

                           (v)    promptly after the filing or receiving
             thereof, copies of all reports and notices that the Borrower or any
             Affiliate  files under ERISA with the Internal  Revenue  Service or
             the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation or the U.S. Department of
             Labor or that the Borrower or any  Affiliate  receives  from any of
             the foregoing or from any multiemployer plan (within the meaning of
             Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which the Borrower or any Affiliate
             is  or  was,  within  the  preceding  five  years,  a  contributing
             employer,  in each case in respect of the  assessment of withdrawal
             liability or an event or condition  which could,  in the aggregate,
             result in the  imposition  of liability on the Borrower  and/or any
             such Affiliate in excess of $250,000;

                                      IV-3

<PAGE>

                           (vi)   at least 30 days  prior  to any change  in the
             Borrower's name or any other change  requiring the amendment of UCC
             financing  statements,  a notice setting forth such changes and the
             effective date thereof;

                           (vii)  such   other   information   respecting   the
             Receivables  (including a Portfolio  Certificate on a more frequent
             basis than  provided in CLAUSE  (iii)  above) or the  condition  or
             operations,  financial or otherwise,  of the Borrower or AFC as the
             Lender may from time to time reasonably request;

                           (viii) promptly after the Borrower obtains  knowledge
             thereof, notice of any (a) litigation,  investigation or proceeding
             which may exist at any time between the  Borrower,  the Servicer or
             AFC, on the one hand, and any Governmental  Authority which, if not
             cured or if adversely determined,  as the case may be, would have a
             Material Adverse Effect, or (b) litigation or proceeding  adversely
             affecting the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries,  the Servicer or
             AFC, as the case may be, in which the amount involved,  in the case
             of the  Servicer  or AFC,  is  $100,000  or more and not covered by
             insurance or in which injunctive or similar relief is sought or (c)
             litigation or proceeding relating to any Transaction Document; and

                           (ix)   promptly after the occurrence thereof, notice
             of any event or circumstance  that could  reasonably be expected to
             have a Material Adverse Effect.

                           (x)    promptly  after receipt thereof, a copy of any
             report or notice provided to the Servicer or the Borrower  pursuant
             to the Isuzu Loan Documents.

                  (l)      SEPARATE CORPORATE EXISTENCE. Each of the Borrower
and  the  Servicer  hereby   acknowledges  that  Lender  is  entering  into  the
transactions  contemplated  by the  Agreement and the  Transaction  Documents in
reliance  upon the  Borrower's  identity as a legal  entity  separate  from AFC.
Therefore,  from and after the date hereof,  the Borrower and AFC shall take all
reasonable steps to continue the Borrower's  identity as a separate legal entity
and to make it apparent  to third  Persons  that the  Borrower is an entity with
assets and liabilities  distinct from those of AFC and any other Person,  and is
not a division of AFC or any other Person.  Without  limiting the  generality of
the foregoing and in addition to and  consistent  with the covenant set forth in
PARAGRAPH  (a) of this  EXHIBIT IV, the Borrower and AFC shall take such actions
as shall be required in order that:

                           (i)    The   Borrower   will  be  a  limited  purpose
             corporation   whose  primary   activities  are  restricted  in  its
             certificate of  incorporation  to purchasing  Receivables from AFC,
             entering into  agreements  for the  servicing of such  Receivables,
             financing  such  Receivables  through  the  issuance of debt to the
             Lender secured by such Receivables and certain related assets,  and
             conducting   such  other   activities  as  it  deems  necessary  or
             appropriate to carry out its primary activities;

                           (ii)   Not less than one member of Borrower's Board
             of Directors (the  "INDEPENDENT  DIRECTORS") shall be an individual
             who is not a direct, indirect or beneficial


                                      IV-4


<PAGE>

             stockholder,  officer, director,  employee,  affiliate,  associate,
             customer,  supplier or agent of AFC or any of its  Affiliates.  The
             Borrower's Board of Directors shall not approve,  or take any other
             action  to cause  the  commencement  of a  voluntary  case or other
             proceeding  with  respect  to the  Borrower  under  any  applicable
             bankruptcy,   insolvency,    reorganization,    debt   arrangement,
             dissolution  or other similar law, or the  appointment of or taking
             possession   by,  a  receiver,   liquidator,   assignee,   trustee,
             custodian,  or other  similar  official for the Borrower  unless in
             each case the  Independent  Directors  shall  approve the taking of
             such  action in  writing  prior to the taking of such  action.  The
             Independent Directors' fiduciary duty shall be to the Borrower (and
             creditors) and not to the Borrower's shareholders in respect of any
             decision of the type  described in the preceding  sentence.  In the
             event an Independent  Director  resigns or otherwise ceases to be a
             director of the  Borrower,  there  shall be selected a  replacement
             Independent  Director  who shall not be an  individual  within  the
             proscriptions  of the first  sentence  of this  CLAUSE  (ii) or any
             individual who has any other type of professional relationship with
             AFC or any of its  Affiliates  or any  management  personnel of any
             such Person or Affiliate  and who shall be (x) a tenured  professor
             at a  business  or  law  school,  (y) a  retired  judge  or  (z) an
             established independent member of the business community,  having a
             sound  reputation  and  experience  relative  to the  duties  to be
             performed by such individual as an Independent Director;

                           (iii)  No  Independent  Director  shall at any time
             serve as a trustee in bankruptcy for AFC or any Affiliate thereof;

                           (iv)   Any  employee,  consultant  or  agent  of  the
             Borrower will be compensated  from the Borrower's own bank accounts
             for services  provided to the Borrower except as provided herein in
             respect of the  Servicer's  Fee. The Borrower will engage no agents
             other than a Servicer for the  Receivables,  which Servicer will be
             fully  compensated  for its  services to the Borrower by payment of
             the Servicer's Fee;

                           (v)    The Borrower will contract with the Servicer
             to perform  for the  Borrower  all  operations  required on a daily
             basis  to  service  its  Receivables.  The  Borrower  will  pay the
             Servicer  a monthly  fee based on the  level of  Receivables  being
             managed by the  Servicer.  The Borrower will not incur any material
             indirect or overhead expenses for items shared between the Borrower
             and AFC or any  Affiliate  thereof  which are not  reflected in the
             Servicer's Fee. To the extent, if any, that the Borrower and AFC or
             any Affiliate  thereof share items of expenses not reflected in the
             Servicer's  Fee,  such as legal,  auditing  and other  professional
             services,  such expenses will be allocated to the extent  practical
             on the basis of actual use or the value of services  rendered,  and
             otherwise  on a basis  reasonably  related to the actual use or the
             value of services rendered,  it being understood that AFC shall pay
             all expenses  relating to the preparation,  negotiation,  execution
             and  delivery  of the  Transaction  Documents,  including,  without
             limitation, legal and other fees;

                           (vi)   The  Borrower's operating expenses will not be
             paid by AFC or any Affiliate thereof unless the Borrower shall have
             agreed in writing with such Person to reimburse such Person for any
             such payments;

                                      IV-5
<PAGE>

                           (vii)  The Borrower will have its own separate
             mailing address and stationery;

                           (viii) The  Borrower's  books and records will be
             maintained separately from those of AFC or any Affiliate thereof;

                           (ix)   Any financial statements which are
             consolidated  to include the Borrower will contain  detailed  notes
             clearly  stating that the Borrower is a separate  corporate  entity
             and has granted a security interest in the Receivables;

                           (x)    The  Borrower's assets will be maintained in a
             manner that facilitates their  identification  and segregation from
             those of AFC and any Affiliate thereof;

                           (xi)   The Borrower will strictly  observe  corporate
             formalities in its dealings with AFC and any Affiliate thereof, and
             funds or other assets of the Borrower will not be  commingled  with
             those of AFC or any  Affiliate  thereof.  The  Borrower  shall  not
             maintain joint bank accounts or other depository  accounts to which
             AFC or any  Affiliate  thereof  (other than AFC in its  capacity as
             Servicer) has independent access. None of the Borrower's funds will
             at any  time be  pooled  with  any  funds  of AFC or any  Affiliate
             thereof;

                           (xii)  The  Borrower  shall  pay to AFC the  marginal
             increase (or, in the absence of such increase, the market amount of
             its portion) of the premium  payable with respect to any  insurance
             policy that covers the Borrower and any Affiliate thereof,  but the
             Borrower shall not, directly or indirectly,  be named or enter into
             an agreement to be named, as a direct or contingent  beneficiary or
             loss payee,  under any such insurance  policy,  with respect to any
             amounts  payable due to occurrences or events related to AFC or any
             Affiliate thereof (other than the Borrower); and

                           (xiii) The   Borrower  will  maintain   arm's  length
             relationships  with AFC and any Affiliate  thereof.  The AFC or any
             Affiliate thereof that renders or otherwise  furnishes  services to
             the Borrower  will be  compensated  by the Borrower at market rates
             for such  services.  Neither the Borrower nor AFC or any  Affiliate
             thereof will be or will hold itself out to be  responsible  for the
             debts of the other or the decisions or actions respecting the daily
             business and affairs of the other.

                  (m)      MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, SALES, ETC.

                           (i)    The Borrower shall not:

         THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (as amended,  supplemented or modified
from time to time, this "AGREEMENT"),  dated as of December 22, 2000, is between
AUTOMOTIVE FINANCE CORPORATION, an Indiana corporation, as originator and seller
(the  "ORIGINATOR"),  and AFC  AIM  CORPORATION,  an  Indiana  corporation  (the

agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                      AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AND CONTRIBUTE

         1.1.  AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE  AND SELL.  On the terms and subject to the

Company, and does hereby sell to the Company, and the Company agrees to purchase

recourse and without regard to  collectibility,  all of the Originator's  right,

foregoing;

amounts owed (including,  without limitation,  finance charges, interest and all
other  charges)  in  respect  of any  Receivable  (other  than  the  Contributed
Portion),  or that are (or are to be) applied to amounts  owed in respect of any

All purchases and contributions  hereunder shall be made without  recourse,  but
shall be made pursuant to and in reliance upon the  representations,  warranties
and covenants of the Originator,  in its capacity as Originator and contributor,
set forth in each Transaction  Document.  The Company's foregoing  commitment to
purchase such  Receivables and the proceeds and rights  described in SUBSECTIONS
(c) through (h) of this SECTION 1.1 (collectively,  including such item relating
to  Contributed  Portion,  the "RELATED  RIGHTS") is herein called the "PURCHASE
FACILITY."

         1.2.  TIMING OF PURCHASES.

         (a)      CLOSING DATE PURCHASES.  The Originator's entire right, title
and interest in (i) each Receivable that existed and was owing to the Originator
as of the opening of the Originator's  business on the Closing Date, (other than
Contributed  Portion) and (ii) all Related Rights with respect  thereto shall be
sold to the Company on the Closing Date.

         (b)      REGULAR PURCHASES.  After the Closing Date, each Receivable
created  or  originated  by the  Originator  and all  Related  Rights  shall  be
purchased  and  owned by the  Company  (without  any  further  action)  upon the
creation or origination of such Receivable.

         1.3.  CONSIDERATION FOR  PURCHASES.  On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement,  the Company agrees to make all Purchase
Price payments to the Originator.

         1.4.  PURCHASE AND SALE TERMINATION  DATE.  The  "PURCHASE  AND SALE
TERMINATION  DATE"  shall  be the  earlier  to  occur  of (a)  the  date  of the
termination of this  Agreement  pursuant to SECTION 8.2 and (b) the Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Originator shall have given notice to
the Company that the Originator desires to terminate this Agreement.

         1.5.  INTENTION OF THE PARTIES. It is the express intent of the parties
hereto that the transfers of the Receivables  (other than  Contributed  Portion)
and Related Rights (other than those relating to the Contributed Portion) by the
Originator to the Company,  as contemplated by this Agreement be, and be treated
as,  sales and not as secured  loans  secured  by the  Receivables  and  Related
Rights.  If,  however,   notwithstanding   the  intent  of  the  parties,   such
transactions are deemed to be loans, the Originator hereby grants to the Company
a first priority security interest in all of the Originator's  right,  title and
interest  in and to each of the items  described  in clauses  (a) through (h) of
SECTION 1.1 above to secure all of the Originator's obligations hereunder.

         1.6.     CERTAIN  DEFINITIONS.  As used in this Agreement,  the terms
"Material Adverse Effect" and "Solvent" are defined as follows:

                  "MATERIAL  ADVERSE EFFECT" means, with respect to any event or
circumstance, a material adverse effect on:

                  (i)   the business, operations, property or financial
condition of the Originator;

                  (ii)  the ability of the Originator or the Servicer (if it is
the  Originator)  to  perform  its

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

obligations  under the Loan and  Servicing  Agreement  or any other  Transaction
Document to which it is a party or the performance of any such obligations;

                  (iii) the validity or enforceability of the Loan and
Servicing Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

                  (iv)  with  respect to the Purchase  and Sale Agreement,  the
status, existence,  perfection, priority or enforceability of Company's interest
in the Receivables or Related Rights; or

                  (v)   the collectibility of the Receivables.

                  "SOLVENT"  means,  with  respect to any Person at any time,  a
condition under which:

                  (i)   the fair value and present fair  saleable  value of such
Person's  total  assets  is,  on the date of  determination,  greater  than such
Person's total liabilities  (including contingent and unliquidated  liabilities)
at such time;

                  (ii)  such Person is and shall continue to be able to pay all
of its liabilities as such liabilities mature; and

                  (iii) such Person  does not have  unreasonably  small  capital
with which to engage in its current and in its anticipated business.

For purposes of this definition:

                  (A) the  amount  of a  Person's  contingent  or unliquidated
         liabilities at any time shall be that amount which, in light of all the
         facts and circumstances then existing,  represents the amount which can
         reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability;

                  (B) the "fair value" of an asset shall be the amount which may
         be realized within a reasonable time either through  collection or sale
         of such asset at its regular market value;

                  (C) the "regular market value" of an asset shall be the amount
         which a capable and  diligent  business  person  could  obtain for such
         asset from an  interested  buyer who is willing to purchase  such asset
         under ordinary selling conditions; and

                  (D) the "present  fair  saleable  value" of an asset means the
         amount  which can be  obtained  if such  asset is sold with  reasonable
         promptness  in an  arm's  length  transaction  in an  existing  and not
         theoretical market.

                                   ARTICLE II

                          CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE

         2.1.  CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. On the Closing Date, the Servicer
shall deliver to the Company,  the Lender and the Originator (if the Servicer is
other than the Originator) a schedule  listing each of the Vehicles  relating to
the  Receivable  funded on the Closing Date,  which  schedule  shall include the
amount of the Advance made with respect to each such  Vehicle.  Thereafter,  the
Servicer  shall provide to the Company,  the Lender and the  Originator  (if the
Servicer is other than the Originator) a copy of each Bailed  Property  Schedule
delivered  to the  Originator  by the  Obligor  pursuant  to Section  2.2 of the
Promissory Note and Security  Agreement with respect to any Vehicle  financed by
an Advance thereunder.

The "PURCHASE  PRICE" (to be paid to the Originator in accordance with the terms
of Article III) for each  Receivable  and the Related  Rights that are purchased
hereunder  shall be equal to the  Outstanding  Balance of such Receivable on the
date of purchase.

         "OUTSTANDING  BALANCE"  means,  with  respect  to any  Receivable,  the
aggregate  amount of all Advances  made by the  Originator  with respect to such
Receivable,  less any amounts deposited in the Collection Account and applied to
the  reduction of the  principal  amount of the related Loan  pursuant to clause
fifth of Section 1.4(d) of the Loan and Servicing Agreement (or paid directly to
the Lender as a repayment of principal with respect to such Loan).

                                   ARTICLE III

                          CONTRIBUTION OF RECEIVABLES;
                            PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE

         3.1.  CONTRIBUTION OF RECEIVABLES. On the Closing Date, the Originator
shall,  and hereby does,  contribute to the capital of the Company,  in exchange
for the issuance of 1,000 shares of common  stock,  a portion of the  Receivable
and the Related  Rights  relating to the Advances made by the  Originator on the
Closing Date,  such that the aggregate  Outstanding  Balance of the  contributed
portion of such Receivable shall be equal to $1,000,000.

         3.2.  INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENT. On the terms and subject to the
conditions  set  forth  in this  Agreement,  the  Company  agrees  to pay to the
Originator  the Purchase Price for the purchase of Receivables to be made on the
Closing  Date,  partially in cash in the amount of the proceeds of the Loan made
by the Lender on the Closing Date under the Loan and  Servicing  Agreement,  and
partially  by  issuing  a  promissory  note  in the  form  of  EXHIBIT  B to the
Originator  with an initial  principal  balance equal to the remaining  Purchase
Price  (as  such  promissory  note may be  amended,  supplemented,  indorsed  or
otherwise modified from time to time,  together with all promissory notes issued
from time to time in substitution therefor or renewal thereof in accordance with
the Transaction Documents, being herein called the "COMPANY NOTE").

                                      -5-

<PAGE>


         3.3.  SUBSEQUENT PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENTS. On each Business Day falling
after the  Closing  Date and on or prior to the  Purchase  and Sale  Termination
Date, on the terms and subject to the  conditions  set forth in this  Agreement,
the Company shall pay to the Originator  the Purchase Price for the  Receivables
sold by the  Originator  to the Company on such  Business  Day, in cash,  to the
extent funds are available to make such payment and such payment is permitted by
paragraph  (o) of Exhibit  IV to the Loan and  Servicing  Agreement,  and to the
extent any of such Purchase Price remains unpaid, such remaining portion of such
Purchase  Price  shall  be  paid  by  means  of an  automatic  increase  to  the
outstanding principal amount of the Company Note.

         Servicer shall make all appropriate record keeping entries with respect
to the  Company  Note  or  otherwise  to  reflect  the  foregoing  payments  and
adjustments  pursuant to SECTION 3.4,  and  Servicer's  books and records  shall
constitute  rebuttable  presumptive  evidence  of the  principal  amount  of and
accrued  interest on the Company Note at any time.  Furthermore,  Servicer shall
hold the Company Note for the benefit of the Originator,  and all payments under
the Company Note shall be made to the Servicer for the account of the applicable
payee thereof. The Originator hereby irrevocably authorizes Servicer to mark the
Company Note  "CANCELLED" and to return the Company Note to the Company upon the
final payment thereof after the occurrence of the Purchase and Sale  Termination
Date.

         3.4.  SETTLEMENT AS TO SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES AND DILUTION.

         (a)   If on the day of purchase or contribution of any Receivable  from
the Originator hereunder,  any of the representations or warranties set forth in
SECTION 5.4,  5.11 or 5.20 is not true with respect to such  Receivable  or as a
result  of any  action  or  inaction  of the  Originator,  on any day any of the
representations or warranties set forth in SECTION 5.4 or 5.11 is no longer true
with respect to such a Receivable,  then the Purchase  Price with respect to the
Receivables  purchased  hereunder  shall be  reduced  by an amount  equal to the
Outstanding  Balance of such Receivable and shall be accounted to the Originator
as provided in SUBSECTION (c) below;  PROVIDED,  that if the Company  thereafter
receives  payment on account of Collections due with respect to such Receivable,
the Company promptly shall deliver such funds to the Originator.

         (b)   If, on any day, the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable
purchased  or  contributed  hereunder  is reduced or adjusted as a result of any
adjustment made by the Originator,  Company or Servicer or any setoff or dispute
between the Originator or the Servicer and the Obligor,  then the Purchase Price
with  respect to the  Receivables  purchased  hereunder  shall be reduced by the
amount of such reduction and shall be accounted to the Originator as provided in
SUBSECTION (c) below.

         (c)   Any reduction in the Purchase Price of the Receivables  pursuant
to  SUBSECTION  (a) or (b) above shall be applied as a credit for the account of
the Company against the Purchase Price of Receivables  subsequently purchased by

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ORIGINATOR

         In order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement and to make
purchases and accept contributions hereunder, the Originator, in its capacity as
Originator under this Agreement, hereby makes the representations and warranties
set forth in this ARTICLE V.

         5.1.  ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.  The Originator has been duly
incorporated  and in existence as a  corporation  under the laws of the state of
its incorporation, with power and authority to own its properties and to conduct
its  business  as such  properties  are  presently  owned and such  business  is
presently conducted.

         5.2.  DUE QUALIFICATION. The Originator is duly licensed or qualified
to do business as a foreign  corporation  in good  standing in the  jurisdiction
where its chief executive office and principal place of business are located and
in all other  jurisdictions  in which the  ownership or lease of its property or
the conduct of its business  requires  such  licensing or  qualification  except
where the  failure  to be so  licensed  or  qualified  has not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.3.  POWER AND AUTHORITY; DUE AUTHORIZATION. The Originator has (a)
all  necessary  corporate  power,  authority  and legal right (i) to execute and
deliver,  and perform its obligations under, each Transaction  Document to which
it is a party, as Originator,  and (ii) to generate,  own, sell,  contribute and
assign Receivables and Related Rights on the terms and subject to the conditions
herein and therein provided; and (b) duly authorized such execution and delivery
and  such  sale,  contribution  and  assignment  and  the  performance  of  such
obligations by all necessary corporate action.

         5.4.  VALID SALE OR  CONTRIBUTION;  BINDING  OBLIGATIONS.  Each sale or
contribution,  as the case may be, of Receivables and Related Rights made by the
Originator  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  constitute  a  valid  sale  or
contribution,  as the case  may be,  transfer,  and  assignment  thereof  to the
Company,  enforceable against creditors of, and purchasers from, the Originator;
and this Agreement constitutes, and each other Transaction Document to be signed
by the  Originator,  as  Originator,  when duly  executed  and  delivered,  will
constitute,   a  legal,   valid,  and  binding  obligation  of  the  Originator,
enforceable  in  accordance  with its  terms,  except as  enforceability  may be
limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   reorganization  or  other  similar  laws
affecting  the  enforcement  of  creditors'  rights  generally  and  by  general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law.


         5.5.  NO VIOLATION. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Originator is
a party as Originator,  and the  fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof will
not (a) conflict  with,  result in any breach of any of the terms and provisions
of, or  constitute  (with or without  notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under (i) the Originator's  articles of  incorporation  or by-laws,  or (ii) any
indenture,  loan  agreement,  mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other  agreement  or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it is

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

bound, (b) result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim upon any of
its  properties  pursuant to the terms of any such  indenture,  loan  agreement,
mortgage,  deed of trust,  or other  agreement  or  instrument,  other  than the
Transaction  Documents,  or (c)  violate any law or any order,  writ,  judgment,
award,  injunction,  decree,  rule,  or  regulation  applicable  to  it  or  its
properties,  where,  in the cases of ITEMS  (a)(ii),  (b) or (c), such conflict,
breach,  default,  Adverse  Claim or violation  has had or could  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.6.  PROCEEDINGS.  (i) There is no litigation or, to the  Originator's
knowledge,  any  proceeding  or  investigation  pending  before  any  Government
Authority or arbitrator (a) asserting the invalidity of any Transaction Document
to which the  Originator  is a party as  Originator,  (b) seeking to prevent the
sale or  contribution  of  Receivables  and Related Rights to the Company or the
consummation  of any of the other  transactions  contemplated by any Transaction
Document to which the  Originator is a party as  Originator,  or (c) seeking any
determination  or ruling  that could  reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse  Effect.  (ii) The  Originator  is not  subject to any order,  judgment,
decree,  injunction,  stipulation  or consent  order that  could  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.7.  BULK SALES ACT.  No transaction contemplated hereby requires
compliance with any bulk sales act or similar law.

         5.8.  GOVERNMENT  APPROVALS. Except for the filing of the UCC financing
statements  referred  to in ARTICLE  IV, all of which,  at the time  required in
ARTICLE IV, shall have been duly made and shall be in full force and effect,  no
authorization  or approval or other  action by, and no notice to or filing with,
any  governmental  authority or regulatory body is required for the Originator's
due execution,  delivery and performance of any Transaction Document to which it
is a party, as Originator.

sale), the Originator shall be Solvent.

subsidiaries  for the  fiscal  year then  ended  certified  by the  Originator's
independent  accountants,  copies of which have been  furnished  to the Company,
present  fairly the  consolidated  financial  position of the Originator and its
consolidated  subsidiaries  for the period ended on such date, all in accordance
with generally accepted accounting  principles  consistently  applied; and since
such date no event has occurred that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                      ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IN
                           RESPECT OF THE RECEIVABLES

         7.1.  RIGHTS OF THE COMPANY.  The  Originator  hereby  authorizes the
Company and the  Servicer  (if other than the  Originator)  or their  respective
designees  to take  any and all  steps in the  Originator's  name  necessary  or
desirable, in their respective  determination,  to collect all amounts due under
any and all  Receivables  and Related  Rights,  including,  without  limitation,
endorsing the  Originator's  name on checks and other  instruments  representing
Collections and enforcing such  Receivables and the provisions of the Isuzu Loan
Documents that concern payment and/or enforcement of rights to payment.

         7.2.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORIGINATOR.  Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding:

         (a)   The Originator  agrees to transfer any Collections that it
receives  directly to the Collection  Account within one Business Day of receipt
thereof,  and agrees that all such  Collections  shall be segregated and held in
trust for the  Company  and the  Lender;  PROVIDED  that if the  Company  or the
Servicer is required by Section 5.4 of the Loan and Servicing Agreement to remit
Collections  directly to the Lender (or its designee) the Originator shall remit
such Collections  directly to the Lender (or its designee) in the same manner as
the Company and Servicer may be required to do so by Section 5.4 of the Loan and
Servicing  Agreement.  The  Originator  further  agrees not to deposit any funds
other than Collections in the Collection Account.

         (b)   The Originator  shall perform its obligations  hereunder, and the
exercise  by the  Company  or its  designee  of its rights  hereunder  shall not
relieve the Originator from such obligations.

         (c)   None of the Company,  Servicer (if other than the Originator), or
the Lender  shall have any  obligation  or liability to the Obligor or any other
third Person with respect to any  Receivables or the Isuzu Loan  Documents,  nor
shall the  Company,  Servicer (if other than the  Originator),  or the Lender be
obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Originator thereunder.


                                  -16-
<PAGE>


         (d)   The Originator agrees to deliver to the Servicer (if other than
the  Originator)  an  irrevocable   power  of  attorney,   with  full  power  of
substitution,  coupled with an interest,  to take in the name of the  Originator
all steps necessary or advisable to indorse,  negotiate or otherwise  realize on
any writing or other right of any kind held or  transmitted by the Originator or
transmitted or received by the Company  (whether or not from the  Originator) in
connection with any Receivable or Related Right.

         7.3.  FURTHER ACTION EVIDENCING PURCHASES.  The Originator agrees that
from time to time,  at its  expense,  it will  promptly  execute and deliver all
further instruments and documents,  and take all further action that the Company
or Servicer may  reasonably  request in order to perfect,  protect or more fully
evidence the Receivables  (and the Related Rights)  purchased by, or contributed
to, the Company  hereunder,  or to enable the Company to exercise or enforce any
of its  rights  hereunder  or under  any  other  Transaction  Document.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Originator will:

         (a)   upon the request of the Company  execute and file such financing
or continuation  statements,  or amendments thereto or assignments  thereof, and
such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate; and

         (b)   mark the summary master control data processing records with the
 legend set forth in SECTION 4.1(i).

The Originator hereby authorizes the Company or its designee to file one or more
financing or  continuation  statements,  and amendments  thereto and assignments
thereof,  relative to all or any of the Receivables (and the Related Rights) now
existing or hereafter  generated by the Originator.  If the Originator  fails to
perform any of its agreements or obligations  under this Agreement,  the Company
or its  designee  may (but shall not be required  to) itself  perform,  or cause
performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the Company or
its designee incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Originator
as provided in SECTION 10.6.

         7.4.  APPLICATION  OF  COLLECTIONS.  Any  payment  by the  Obligor in
respect  of any  indebtedness  owed by it to the  Originator  shall,  except  as
otherwise  specified by the Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and
unless otherwise instructed by the Company or the Lender, be applied FIRST, as a
Collection of any  Receivables  of the Obligor,  in the order of the age of such
Receivables,  starting with the oldest of such  Receivables,  and SECOND, to any
other indebtedness of the Obligor.

pursuant  hereto or thereto  shall prove to have been false or  incorrect in any
material respect when made or deemed made provided, however, if the violation of
this  paragraph  (c) by the  Originator  may be cured  without any  potential or
actual  detriment to the Company,  or the Lender,  the Originator  shall have 30
days from the earlier of (i) the Originator's knowledge of such failure and (ii)
notice to the Originator of such failure to so cure any such violation  before a
Purchase and Sale  Termination  Event shall occur so long as the  Originator  is
diligently attempting to effect such cure; or

         (d)    The Originator shall fail to perform or observe in any material
respect any agreement  contained in any of SECTIONS 6.1(g) or 6.3; or

         (e)    The Originator  shall fail to perform or observe any other
material term,  covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on its part to
be performed or observed and such failure  shall remain  unremedied  for 30 days
after written  notice  thereof shall have been given by Servicer,  the Lender or
the Company to the Originator; or

         (f)(i) The Originator or any of its  subsidiaries  shall generally not
pay its debts as such debts become due, or shall admit in writing its  inability
to pay its debts generally,  or shall make a general  assignment for the benefit
of creditors; or any proceeding shall be instituted by or against the Originator
or any of its subsidiaries seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent,  or
seeking  liquidation,  winding  up,  reorganization,   arrangement,  adjustment,
protection,  relief, or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to
bankruptcy,  insolvency or reorganization  or relief of debtors,  or seeking the
entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or other
similar  official for it or for all or any substantial part of its property and,
in the case of any such proceeding  instituted against it (but not instituted by
it), such  proceeding  shall remain  undismissed  or unstayed for a period of 30
days; or (ii) the Originator or any of its subsidiaries shall take any corporate
action to  authorize  any of the  actions  set forth in CLAUSE (i) above in this
SECTION 8.1(f);

         (g)    A contribution failure shall occur with respect to any benefit
plan  sufficient  to give rise to a lien under Section  302(f) of ERISA,  or the
Internal  Revenue  Service shall,  or shall indicate its intention in writing to
the Originator to, file notice of a lien asserting a claim or claims pursuant to
the Code with  regard to any of the  assets of the  Originator,  or the  Pension
Benefit Guaranty  Corporation  shall, or shall indicate its intention in writing
to the  Originator  or an ERISA  Affiliate  to,  either  file  notice  of a lien
asserting a claim  pursuant to ERISA with regard to any assets of the Originator
or an ERISA  Affiliate or terminate  any benefit plan that has unfunded  benefit
liabilities; or

         8.2.    REMEDIES.

                  (i)  OPTIONAL  TERMINATION.  Upon the occurrence of a Purchase
         and Sale  Termination  Event, the Company (and not Servicer) shall have
         the option by notice to the  Originator  (with a copy to the Lender) to
         declare the Purchase and Sale Termination Date to have occurred.

                  (ii) REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Upon any termination of the Facility
         pursuant to this SECTION 8.2,  the Company  shall have,  in addition to

         jurisdiction   and  other   applicable  laws,  which  rights  shall  be
         cumulative.  Without  limiting the  foregoing,  the  occurrence  of the
         Purchase  and Sale  Termination  Date  shall not deny the  Company  any
         remedy in addition to termination of the Purchase Facility to which the
         Company  may be  otherwise  appropriately  entitled,  whether at law or
         equity.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         9.1.    INDEMNITIES BY THE ORIGINATOR.  Without limiting any other
rights  which the  Company  may have  hereunder  or under  applicable  law,  the
Originator hereby agrees to indemnify the Company,  the Lender and each of their
respective  assigns,  officers,  directors,  employees  and agents  (each of the
foregoing  Persons being  individually  called a "PURCHASE AND SALE  INDEMNIFIED
PARTY"),  forthwith  on demand,  from and against any and all  damages,  losses,
claims,  judgments,  liabilities  and  related  costs  and  expenses,  including
reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements  (all  of the  foregoing  being
collectively  called  "PURCHASE AND SALE  INDEMNIFIED  AMOUNTS"),  regardless of
whether  any such  Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Amount  is the  result  of a
Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party's negligence, strict liability or other acts
or  omissions  of a Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party,  awarded  against or
incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of the following:

         (a)   the  transfer by the  Originator of an interest in any Receivable
or Related Right to any Person other than the Company;

         (b)   the breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Originator  under or in connection with this Agreement or any other  Transaction
Document,  or any  information or report  delivered by the  Originator  pursuant

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

Purchase  Report)  which  shall have been  false or  incorrect  in any  material
respect when made, deemed made or delivered;

         (c)   the failure by the  Originator to comply with any applicable law,
rule or regulation  with respect to any Receivable or the Isuzu Loan  Documents,
or the nonconformity of any Receivable or the Isuzu Loan Documents with any such
applicable law, rule or regulation;

         (d)   the failure to vest and maintain  vested in the Company a
perfected ownership interest in the Receivables  generated by the Originator and
Related Rights free and clear of any Adverse Claim,  other than an Adverse Claim
arising  solely as a result of an act of the  Company,  whether  existing at the
time  of the  purchase  or  contribution  of  such  Receivables  or at any  time
thereafter;

         (e)   the failure of the  Originator to file with respect to itself, or
any delay by the  Originator  in filing,  financing  statements or other similar
instruments or documents  under the UCC of any applicable  jurisdiction or other
applicable  laws  with  respect  to any  Receivables  or  purported  Receivables
generated  by the  Originator  or  Related  Rights,  whether  at the time of any
purchase or contribution or at any subsequent time;

         (f)   any  dispute,  claim, offset or defense (other than  discharge in
bankruptcy)  of the  Obligor  to the  payment  of any  Receivable  or  purported
Receivable generated by the Originator (including, without limitation, a defense
based on such  Receivables or the Isuzu Loan Documents not being a legal,  valid
and binding obligation of the Obligor  enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms),  or any other claim  resulting  from or relating to the  transaction
giving rise to any Receivable or relating to collection  activities with respect
to  any  Receivable  (if  such  collection  activities  were  performed  by  the
Originator  or any of its  Affiliates  acting  as  Servicer  or by any  agent or
independent contractor retained by the Originator or any of its Affiliates);

         (g)   any products liability or other claim, investigation, litigation
or proceeding arising out of or in connection with goods,  insurance or services
that secure or relate to any Receivable;

         (h)   any litigation, proceeding or investigation against the
Originator or in respect of any Receivable or Related Right;

         (i)   any tax or governmental fee or charge (other than any tax
excluded  pursuant to the proviso below),  all interest and penalties thereon or
with respect thereto,  and all out-of-pocket  costs and expenses,  including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in defending against the same, which may
arise by reason of the purchase, contribution or ownership of the Receivables or
any Related Right connected with any such Receivables;

         (j)   any failure of the Originator,  individually or as Servicer,  to
perform its duties or  obligations  in  accordance  with the  provisions of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document; and

         (k)   the commingling of any Collections at any time with other funds;


                                      -20-


<PAGE>



EXCLUDING,  HOWEVER,  (i)  Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Amounts to the extent
resulting from gross negligence or willful  misconduct on the part of a Purchase
and Sale Indemnified  Party,  (ii) any  indemnification  which has the effect of
recourse  for  non-payment  of the  Receivables  due to  credit  reasons  to the
Originator  (except as otherwise  specifically  provided under this SECTION 9.1)
and (iii) any tax based upon or measured by net income or gross receipts.

         If for any reason the  indemnification  provided  above in this SECTION
9.1 is unavailable to a Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party or is insufficient
to hold such Purchase and Sale Indemnified  Party harmless,  then the Originator
shall  contribute  to the  amount  paid or  payable  by such  Purchase  and Sale
Indemnified  Party as a result of such loss,  claim,  damage or liability to the
maximum  extent  permitted  under  applicable  law.  Promptly after receipt by a
Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE IX of notice of any claim
or the  commencement  of any  action  arising  out of or as a  result  of any of
paragraphs (a) through (j) above, the Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party shall,
if a claim in respect  thereof is to be made against the  Originator  under this
ARTICLE IX, notify the Originator in writing of the claim or the commencement of
that action; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that the failure to notify the Originator shall
not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this ARTICLE IX except
to the extent it has been materially  prejudiced by such failure and,  PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that the failure to notify the Originator shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to a Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party otherwise
than under this ARTICLE IX. If any such claim or action shall be brought against
a Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party,  the  Originator  shall be entitled to
participate  therein  and, to the extent  that it wishes,  to assume the defense
thereof with counsel  satisfactory to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party.
After notice from the Originator to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party of
its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Originator shall
not be liable to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party under this ARTICLE IX
for any legal or other  expenses  subsequently  incurred  by  Purchase  and Sale
Indemnified  Party in connection  with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of  investigation.  The Originator shall not (i) without the prior written
consent of the relevant  Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party or Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  settle or compromise or consent to
the entry of any  judgment  with  respect to any  pending or  threatened  claim,
action,  suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution
may be sought hereunder  (whether or not the Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party
or Parties are actual or potential  parties to such claim or action) unless such
settlement,  compromise  or consent  includes an  unconditional  release of each
Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party from all  liability  arising  out of such
claim,  action,  suit or proceeding or (ii) be liable for any  settlement of any
such action  affected  without its written  consent  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a
final  judgment of the plaintiff in any such action,  the  Originator  agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified  party from and against any Purchase
and Sale Indemnified Amounts relating thereto.

stated in such waiver or approval, be applicable to subsequent transactions.  No
waiver or approval under this Agreement  shall require any similar or dissimilar

hereunder or any interest  herein  without the prior  consent of the Company and
the  Lender.   This  Agreement   shall  create  and  constitute  the  continuing
obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and shall remain
in full force and effect until the date after the Purchase and Sale  Termination
Date on which the  Originator has received  payment in full for all  Receivables
and Related  Rights  purchased  pursuant  to SECTION 1.1 hereof.  The rights and
remedies with respect to any breach of any  representation  and warranty made by
the  Originator  pursuant  to  ARTICLE  V and the  indemnification  and  payment
provisions of ARTICLE IX and SECTION 10.6 shall be continuing  and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

                                        3
<PAGE>

         shall first be paid and performed in full and in cash before Originator
         shall be entitled to receive and to retain any payment or  distribution
         in respect of this Term Note. In order to implement the foregoing:  (i)
         all payments and  distributions  of any kind or character in respect of
         this Term Note to which Holder would be entitled except for this CLAUSE
         (b) shall be made directly to the Lender (for the benefit of the Senior
         Interest  Holders);  (ii) Holder shall promptly file a claim or claims,
         in the  form  required  in any  Bankruptcy  Proceedings,  for the  full
         outstanding  amount of this  Term  Note,  and  shall  use  commercially
         reasonable efforts to cause said claim or claims to be approved and all
         payments and other distributions in respect thereof to be made directly
         to the Lender (for the benefit of the Senior  Interest  Holders)  until
         the Senior  Interests shall have been paid and performed in full and in
         cash; and (iii) Holder hereby  irrevocably  agrees that Lender,  in the
         name of Holder or  otherwise,  demand,  sue for,  collect,  receive and
         receipt for any and all such payments or distributions, and file, prove
         and vote or consent in any such Bankruptcy  Proceedings with respect to
         any and all claims of Holder  relating to this Term Note,  in each case
         until the Senior  Interests  shall have been paid and performed in full
         and in cash;

                  (c) In the event that  Holder  receives  any  payment or other
         distribution  of any kind or  character  from the  Company  or from any
         other source  whatsoever,  in respect of this Term Note,  other than as
         expressly  permitted  by the terms of this Term Note,  such  payment or
         other  distribution  shall be received in trust for the Senior Interest
         Holders  and shall be turned  over by  Holder  to the  Lender  (for the
         benefit of the Senior Interest Holders) forthwith. Holder will mark its
         books and  records  so as clearly  to  indicate  that this Term Note is
         subordinated  in  accordance  with the terms  hereof.  All payments and
         distributions  received by the Lender in respect of this Term Note,  to
         the extent  received in or converted  into cash,  may be applied by the
         Lender (for the benefit of the Senior  Interest  Holders)  first to the
         payment of any and all expenses (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees
         and legal expenses) paid or incurred by the Senior Interest  Holders in
         enforcing these Subordination  Provisions, or in endeavoring to collect
         or realize upon this Term Note, and any balance  thereof shall,  solely
         as between  Originator and the Senior Interest  Holders,  be applied by
         the Lender (in the order of application  set forth in SECTION 1.4(d) of
         the Loan and  Servicing  Agreement)  toward  the  payment of the Senior
         Interests;  but as  between  the  Company  and its  creditors,  no such
         payments or  distributions  of any kind or character shall be deemed to
         be payments or distributions in respect of the Senior Interests;

                  (d) Notwithstanding any payments or distributions  received by
         the Senior  Interest  Holders  in respect of this Term Note,  while any
         Bankruptcy  Proceedings  are pending  Holder shall not be subrogated to
         the then existing rights of the Senior  Interest  Holders in respect of
         the  Senior  Interests  until the Senior  Interests  have been paid and
         performed  in  full  and in  cash.  If no  Bankruptcy  Proceedings  are
         pending,  Holder  shall only be entitled to  exercise  any  subrogation
         rights that it may acquire (by reason of a payment or  distribution  to
         the Senior Interest Holders in respect of this Term Note) to the extent
         that any payment  arising out of the  exercise of such rights  would be
         permitted  under  CLAUSE (n) of  EXHIBIT  IV to the Loan and  Servicing
         Agreement;

                  (e) These Subordination Provisions are intended solely for the
         purpose of defining the relative rights of Holder, on the one hand, and
         the Senior  Interest  Holders on the other hand.  Nothing  contained in
         these  Subordination  Provisions  or  elsewhere  in this  Term  Note is
         intended to or shall  impair,  as between the  Company,  its  creditors
         (other than the Senior  Interest  Holders)  and Holder,  the  Company's
         obligation,  which is  unconditional  and  absolute,  to pay Holder the
         principal  of and interest on this Term Note as and when the same shall
         become due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof or to affect
         the relative  rights of Holder and creditors of the Company (other than
         the Senior Interest Holders);

                  (f) Holder  shall not,  until the Senior  Interests  have been
         paid and  performed in full and in cash,  (i) cancel,  waive,  forgive,
         transfer  or  assign,  or  commence  legal  proceedings  to  enforce or
         collect,  or subordinate  to any  obligation of the Company,  howsoever
         created, arising or evidenced,  whether direct or indirect, absolute or
         contingent,  or now or  hereafter  existing,  or due or to become  due,
         other  than the  Senior  Interests,  this  Term  Note or any  rights in
         respect  hereof or (ii) convert this Term Note into an equity  interest
         in the Company,  unless  Holder shall have  received the prior  written
         consent of the Lender in each case;

                  (g) Holder shall not,  without the advance  written consent of
         the Lender, commence, or join with any other Person in commencing,  any
         Bankruptcy  Proceedings  with respect to the Company until at least one
         year and one day shall have  passed  since the Senior  Interests  shall
         have been paid and performed in full and in cash;

                  (h) If, at any time,  any payment (in whole or in part) of any
         Senior  Interest  is  rescinded  or must be  restored  or returned by a
         Senior   Interest   Holder   (whether  in  connection  with  Bankruptcy
         Proceedings  or  otherwise),   these  Subordination   Provisions  shall
         continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, as
         though such payment had not been made;

                  (i) Each of the  Senior  Interest  Holders  may,  from time to
         time, at its sole  discretion,  without  notice to Holder,  and without
         waiving any of its rights under these  Subordination  Provisions,  take
         any or all of the following  actions:  (i) retain or obtain an interest
         in any property to secure any of the Senior  Interests;  (ii) retain or
         obtain the primary or  secondary  obligations  of any other  obligor or

                  (j) Holder  hereby  waives:  (i) notice of acceptance of these
         Subordination  Provisions by any of the Senior Interest  Holders;  (ii)
         notice of the existence,  creation,  non-payment or  non-performance of
         all  or any of  the  Senior  Interests;  and  (iii)  all  diligence  in
         enforcement,  collection or protection  of, or  realization  upon,  the
         Senior Interests, or any thereof, or any security therefor;

                  (k) Each of the  Senior  Interest  Holders  may,  from time to
         time,  on the  terms and  subject  to the  conditions  set forth in the
         Transaction  Documents  to which such  Persons  are party,  but without
         notice  to  Holder,  assign  or  transfer  any or  all  of  the  Senior
         Interests,  or any  interest  therein;  and,  notwithstanding  any such
         assignment  or  transfer  or  any  subsequent  assignment  or  transfer
         thereof, such Senior Interests shall be and remain Senior Interests for
         the purposes of these Subordination Provisions, and every immediate and
         successive  assignee or transferee of any of the Senior Interests or of
         any interest of such  assignee or  transferee  in the Senior  Interests
         shall be entitled to the benefits of these Subordination  Provisions to
         the same extent as if such assignee or transferee  were the assignor or
         transferor; and

                  (l) These  Subordination  Provisions  constitute  a continuing
         offer from the holder of this Term Note to all  Persons  who become the
         holders  of,  or who  continue  to hold,  Senior  Interests;  and these
         Subordination  Provisions  are  made  for  the  benefit  of the  Senior
         Interest Holders, and the Lender may proceed to enforce such provisions
         on behalf of each of such Persons.

    10.  GENERAL.  No failure or delay on the part of Originator in exercising
any power or right hereunder  shall operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any
single or  partial  exercise  of any such power or right  preclude  any other or
further  exercise  thereof  or the  exercise  of any other  power or  right.  No
amendment,  modification or waiver of, or consent with respect to, any provision
of this Term Note shall in any event be  effective  unless (i) the same shall be
in writing  and  signed and  delivered  by the  Company  and Holder and (ii) all
consents  required for such actions under the  Transaction  Documents shall have
been received by the appropriate Persons.

    11.  MAXIMUM  INTEREST.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Term Note to the
contrary,  the Company  shall never be required to pay unearned  interest on any
amount outstanding  hereunder and shall never be required to pay interest on the
principal  amount  outstanding  hereunder  at a rate in  excess  of the  maximum
nonusurious  interest rate that may be contracted for, charged or received under
applicable  federal  or state law (such  maximum  rate being  herein  called the
"HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE").  If the effective rate of interest which would otherwise
by payable under this Term Note would exceed the Highest  Lawful Rate, or if the
holder of this Term Note shall  receive any unearned  interest or shall  receive
monies that are deemed to constitute interest which would increase the effective
rate of interest payable by the Company under this Term Note to a rate in excess
of the  Highest  Lawful  Rate,  then (i) the  amount  of  interest  which  would
otherwise by payable by the Company under this Term Note shall be reduced to the
amount  allowed by  applicable  law, and (ii) any unearned  interest paid by the
Company or any interest paid by the Company in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate
shall be refunded to the Company. Without limitation of the foregoing, all

                                        6
<PAGE>

calculations  of the rate of  interest  contracted  for,  charged or received by
Originator  under this Term Note that are made for the  purpose  of  determining
whether such rate exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to Originator (such
Highest Lawful Rate being herein called the  "ORIGINATOR'S  MAXIMUM  PERMISSIBLE
RATE")  shall be made,  to the  extent  permitted  by usury laws  applicable  to
Originator (now or hereafter enacted), by amortizing, prorating and spreading in
equal  parts  during  the  actual  period  during  which  any  amount  has  been
outstanding  hereunder  all  interest  at any time  contracted  for,  charged or
received by Originator in connection  herewith.  If at any time and from time to
time (i) the  amount of  interest  payable  to  Originator  on any date shall be
computed at Originator's  Maximum Permissible Rate pursuant to the provisions of
the  foregoing  sentence  and  (ii)  in  respect  of  any  subsequent   interest
computation  period the amount of interest otherwise payable to Originator would
be  less  than  the  amount  of  interest  payable  to  Originator  computed  at
Originator's  Maximum  Permissible  Rate, then the amount of interest payable to
Originator  in respect of such  subsequent  interest  computation  period  shall
continue to be computed at Originator's Maximum Permissible Rate until the total
amount of  interest  payable  to  Originator  shall  equal  the total  amount of
interest  which would have been  payable to  Originator  if the total  amount of
interest  had been  computed  without  giving  effect to the  provisions  of the
foregoing sentence.

    12.  NO NEGOTIATION.  This Term Note is not negotiable.

    13.  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS TERM NOTE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE
UNDER  AND  GOVERNED  BY THE LAWS OF THE  STATE OF  INDIANA  WITHOUT  REGARD  TO
CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.

    14.  CAPTIONS.  Paragraph  captions  used in this  Term  Note  are for
convenience  only and shall not affect  the  meaning  or  interpretation  of any
provision of this Term Note.

<F1> The supplemental  ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes  Minnesota  Power's  obligation under a contract with
     Square Butte which extends  through 2026, pursuant to which  Minnesota  Power is entitled to  approximately  71% of the
     output of a 455-megawatt coal-fired  generating unit (Unit).  Minnesota Power is obligated to pay its pro rata share of
     Square Butte's costs based on Unit output entitlement. Minnesota Power's payment obligation is suspended if Square Butte
     fails to deliver any power, whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one year. Square Butte's fixed costs consist
     primarily of debt service.  Variable operating costs include the price of coal purchased from BNI Coal under a long-term
     contract. (See Note 14.)
