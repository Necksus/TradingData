                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
                                    UNDER THE
                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995


         In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or  on  behalf  of  the  Company  in  this  annual   report  on  Form  10-K,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",
"expects",  "intends",  "plans",  "predicts",  "projects", "will likely result",
"will continue",  or similar expressions) are not statements of historical facts
and may be forward-looking.

         Forward-looking   statements   involve  estimates,   assumptions,   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control  of the  Company  and may cause
actual  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in  forward-looking
statements:

         -   prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including
             those of the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC and the PSCW,  with
             respect to allowed  rates of return,  industry and rate  structure,
             acquisition  and disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation and
             construction of plant facilities,  recovery of purchased power, and
             present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including
             but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs);
         -   economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
             risks; 
         -   changes in and compliance  with  environmental  and safety
             laws and policies; 
         -   weather conditions; 
         -   population growth rates and demographic   patterns;
         -   competition  for  retail  and  wholesale customers;  
         -   pricing  and  transportation  of  commodities;  
         -   market demand,  including structural market changes; 
         -   changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of  inflation;  
         -   changes in project  costs;
         -   unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital 
             expenditures;  
         -   capital  market  conditions;  
         -   competition  for  new energy  development  opportunities; and
         -   legal and  administrative proceedings (whether  civil or  criminal)
             and settlements  that influence the business and profitability of 
             the Company.

         Any forward-looking  statement speaks only as of the date on which such
statement  is made,  and the  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any
forward-looking  statement to reflect events or circumstances  after the date on
which such  statement  is made or to reflect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated
events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of such  factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any
such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

         Since 1983 Minnesota Power has been diversifying to reduce its reliance
on electricity  sales to Minnesota's  taconite  industry and to gain  additional
earnings  growth   potential.   Acquisitions   have  been  a  primary  means  of
diversification.  During 1997 the Company  continued its  corporate  strategy of
expanding   existing   business   segments.   Electric   Operations   created  a
telecommunications  subsidiary, while Water Services acquired a water subsidiary
and established two non-regulated  subsidiaries.  Automotive  Services added two
auction facilities and 25 loan production offices. The Company plans to consider
other acquisitions that would complement its businesses, expand its services and
contribute to earnings growth.

                               ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

         Electric   Operations   generate,   transmit,   distribute  and  market
electricity.    In   addition   Electric   Operations   include   coal   mining,
telecommunications  and  economic  development  projects  within  the  Company's
service area.  Electric  Operations intend to seek cost saving  alternatives and
efficiencies, and expand non-regulated services.

         -    MINNESOTA  POWER  provides  electricity  in a 26,000  square mile
              electric service territory located in northeastern  Minnesota.  As
              of December 31, 1997 Minnesota Power was supplying retail electric
              service to 122,000 customers in 153 cities, towns and communities,
              and outlying rural areas. The largest city served is Duluth with a
              population of 85,000 based on the 1990 census.  Wholesale electric
              service  for  resale  is  supplied  to 15  municipal  distribution
              systems, one private utility and SWL&P.

              MPEX,  a division of  Minnesota  Power,  is an  expansion  of the
              Company's inter-utility marketing group which has been a buyer and
              seller of capacity  and energy for over 25 years in the  wholesale
              power market.  The customers of MPEX are other power  suppliers in
              the Midwest and Canada.  MPEX also contracts with its customers to
              provide hourly energy scheduling and power trading services.

         -    SUPERIOR  WATER,  LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY sells  electricity  and
              natural gas, and provides water service in northwestern Wisconsin.
              As of December 31, 1997 SWL&P served  14,000  electric  customers,
              11,000 natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers.

         -    BNI COAL owns and  operates a lignite mine in North  Dakota.  Two
              electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte,
              presently  consume  virtually  all of  BNI  Coal's  production  of
              lignite coal under coal supply agreements extending to 2027. Under
              an agreement with Square Butte, Minnesota Power purchases about 71
              percent of the output from the Square  Butte unit which is capable
              of generating up to 455 MW. Minnkota Power has an option to extend
              its coal supply agreement to 2042. (See - Fuel and Note 5.)
 
         -    ELECTRIC OUTLET, INC. is a retail store that sells life-style  
              changing electric products  and also researches new products to 
              be offered for sale and distribution.

         -    MINNESOTA POWER TELECOM,  INC., formed in 1997, will provide high
              volume  fiber optic and  microwave  communications  to  businesses
              across the Company's service territory.

         -    UPPER  MINNESOTA  PROPERTIES,  INC.  has  invested in  affordable
              housing   projects   located  in  Electric   Operations'   service
              territory.  The Company is also an active participant in a variety
              of economic  development  projects throughout Electric Operations'
              service territory providing resources and expertise.

ELECTRIC SALES

         The two major  industries in Minnesota  Power's  service  territory are
taconite production,  and paper and pulp mills. Taconite customers accounted for
31 percent of the Company's  electric  operating  revenue and income in 1997 (32
percent in 1996; 35 percent in 1995). Paper and pulp customers  accounted for 12
percent of electric operating revenue and income in 1997 (11 percent in 1996; 12
percent in 1995).  Sales to other power  suppliers  accounted  for 12 percent of
electric  operating revenue and income in 1997 (13 percent in 1996; 9 percent in
1995). As deregulation of the electric utility industry approaches,  the Company
believes the percentage of electric  revenue from sales to other power suppliers
will  continue to increase.  The  percentage  of electric  revenue from taconite
customers is expected to decrease as other strategic initiatives, including MPEX
and MP Telecom, add to electric operating revenue and income.

         Over the last five years,  80 percent of the  domestic  ore consumed by
iron and steel plants in the United States has originated from plants within the
Company's  electric  service  territory.   Taconite,  an  iron-bearing  rock  of
relatively  low iron content which is abundantly  available in Minnesota,  is an
important  domestic  source of raw  material  for the steel  industry.  Taconite
processing   plants  use  large  quantities  of  electric  power  to  grind  the
ore-bearing rock, and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite
pellets. Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 47 million tons in 1997 (46
million tons in 1996; 

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

47  million  tons in 1995).  Based on the  Company's  research  of the  taconite
industry, 1998 Minnesota taconite production is anticipated to remain at or near
the 1997  level.  While  taconite  production  is expected to continue at annual
levels over 40 million tons, the long-term  future of this cyclical  industry is
less certain. Production may decline gradually some time after the year 2008.

         LARGE POWER CUSTOMER CONTRACTS

         The Company  has Large  Power  Customer  contracts  with five  taconite
producers,  four paper and pulp mills,  and two pipeline  companies (Large Power
Customers),  each of which requires 10 MW or more of generating capacity.  Large
Power  Customer  contracts  require  the  Company  to have a  certain  amount of
generating capacity available at all times. In turn each Large Power Customer is
required  to pay a minimum  monthly  demand  charge  that covers the fixed costs
associated  with having  capacity  available to serve the customer,  including a
return on common equity.  Most contracts  allow customers to establish the level
of MW subject to a demand  charge on a periodic  (pool season) basis and require
that a portion of their MW needs be  committed  on a  take-or-pay  basis for the
entire term of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge, each Large Power
Customer is billed an energy charge for each kilowatthour used that recovers the
variable  costs  incurred  in  generating  electricity.  Six of the Large  Power
Customers have interruptible service for a portion of their needs which includes
a discounted  demand rate and energy  priced at the Company's  incremental  cost
after serving all firm power obligations.  The Company also provides incremental
production  service for customer  demand  levels above the contract  take-or-pay
levels.  There is no demand  charge for this  service and energy is priced at an
increment  above  the  Company's  cost.   Incremental   production   service  is
interruptible.

         Each contract continues after the contract termination date, unless the
required four-year advance notice of cancellation has been given. Such contracts
minimize the impact on earnings  that  otherwise  would result from  significant
reductions in kilowatthour  sales to such  customers.  Large Power Customers are
required to purchase their entire electric service requirements from the Company
for the  duration  of their  contracts.  The  rates  and  corresponding  revenue
associated  with capacity and energy  provided under these contracts are subject
to change  through the same  regulatory  process  governing all retail  electric
rates.  Minnesota  Power has  implemented  a key account  management  process to
heighten its focus on large  commercial  and  industrial  customers' needs,  and
anticipates  continuing  negotiations with these customers to explore options to
respond to those needs. (See Regulatory Issues - Electric Rates.)

         As of March 15, 1998 the  minimum  annual  revenue  the  Company  would
collect under contracts with these Large Power  Customers,  assuming no electric
energy use by these customers,  is estimated to be $101.8,  $78.3,  $69.2, $66.5
and  $47.3  million  during  the  years  1998,   1999,   2000,  2001  and  2002,
respectively.  Based on past  experiences and projected  operating  levels,  the
Company  believes revenue from these Large Power Customers will be substantially
in excess of the minimum contract amounts.

     contract as energy is available from that unit.
     
(b)  Under an agreement  extending  through 2007 with Square Butte,  Minnesota 
     Power purchases  about 71 percent of the output of a mine-mouth  generating
     unit capable of generating up to 455 MW. The Square Butte  generating  unit
     is located near Center,  North Dakota and is one of two lignite-fired units
     at Minnkota Power's Milton R. Young Generating Station. Reductions to about
     49 percent  of the output are  provided  for in the  contract  and,  at the
     option of Square Butte, could begin after a five-year advance notice to the
     Company.  The cost of the power and  energy  purchased  is a  proportionate
     share  of  Square  Butte's  fixed  and  variable  costs.   The  Company  is
     responsible  for paying all costs and expenses of Square  Butte  (including
     leasing,  operating and any debt service costs) if not paid by Square Butte
     when due. These obligations of the Company are absolute and  unconditional,
     whether or not any power is actually  delivered to the  Company. (See Note
     5.)

CAPACITY SALES

         Minnesota Power has contracts to sell capacity to nonaffiliated utility
companies.  In addition to the contracts  listed below,  the Company has entered

FUEL

         The Company purchases  low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous coal from the Powder
River Basin coal field  located in Montana and  Wyoming.  Coal  consumption  for
electric generation at the Company's Minnesota coal-fired generating stations in
1997 was about 4.1 million  tons. As of December 31, 1997 the Company had a coal
inventory of about 497,000 tons. The Company has three coal supply agreements in
place with  Montana  suppliers.  Two  terminate  in December  1999 and the other
terminates in December 2000.  Under these agreements the Company has the tonnage
flexibility to procure 70 percent to 100 percent of its total coal requirements.
The Company will obtain coal in 1998 under these agreements and the spot market.
This mix of coal supply  options allows the Company to reduce market risk and to
take advantage of favorable spot market prices.  The Company is exploring future
coal  supply  options  and  believes  that  adequate   supplies  of  low-sulfur,
sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available.

         Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad transports the coal by unit train
from Montana or Wyoming to the Company's  generating  stations.  The Company and
Burlington  Northern  Santa Fe Railroad  have two  long-term  coal  freight-rate
contracts  that provide for coal  deliveries  through 2002 to Laskin and through
2003 to Boswell.  The Company also has a contract with the Duluth Missabe & Iron
Range  Railway  which is the final  destination  short-hauler  to  Laskin.  This
contract  provides for deliveries  through 2002. The delivered  price of coal is
subject to periodic adjustments in freight rates.

         The generating unit operated by Square Butte burns North Dakota lignite
supplied by BNI Coal, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,  pursuant to the
terms of a contract  expiring in 2027.  Square Butte's cost of lignite burned in
1997 was  approximately  64 cents per MBtu.  The lignite  acreage  that has been
dedicated  to Square  Butte by BNI Coal is located on lands  essentially  all of
which are under private  control and presently  leased by BNI Coal. This lignite
supply is sufficient to provide the fuel for the anticipated  useful life of the
generating unit. Under the various  agreements with Square Butte, the Company is
unconditionally  obligated  to pay all costs not paid by Square  Butte when due.
These costs include the price of lignite  purchased  under a cost-plus  contract
from BNI Coal.  (See Item 2. Properties and Note 5.) BNI Coal has experienced no
difficulty in supplying all of Square Butte's lignite requirements.

REGULATORY ISSUES

         The Company and its  subsidiaries  are exempt from regulation under the
Public Utility Holding  Company Act of 1935,  except as to Section 9(a)(2) which
relates to acquisition of securities of public utility operations.

         The Company and its  subsidiaries  are subject to the  jurisdiction  of
various regulatory authorities.  The MPUC has regulatory authority over Electric
Operations' service area in Minnesota,  retail rates, retail services,  issuance
of securities and other matters. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of
hydroelectric  projects,  the establishment of rates and charges for the sale of
electricity for resale and  transmission of electricity in interstate  commerce,
and certain  accounting  and record keeping  practices.  The PSCW has regulatory
authority  over the retail  sales of  electricity,  water and gas by SWL&P.  The
MPUC, FERC and PSCW had regulatory  authority over 68 percent, 12 percent, and 8
percent,  respectively,  of the Company's  1997 electric  operating  revenue and
income.

         ELECTRIC RATES

         The Company has historically  designed its electric service rates based
on cost of service  studies  under  which  allocations  are made to the  various
classes of customers. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses
which  adjust  electric  service  rates  for  changes  in the  cost of fuel  and
purchased energy, and recovery of current and deferred CIP expenditures.

                                      -6-

<PAGE>
         The demand charge component of the Company's large power rate schedules
are  designed to recover the fixed  costs of  providing  capacity to Large Power
Customers, including a return on common equity. A Large Power Customer's monthly
demand charge  obligation in any particular  month is determined  based upon the
firm demand amount. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity
and energy  provided  under these  contracts  are subject to change  through the
regulatory  process  governing all retail electric rates.  Contracts with ten of
the eleven  Large Power  Customers  provide  for  deferral  without  interest or
diminishment of one-half of demand charge obligations  incurred during the first
three  months of a strike or illegal  walkout at a customer's  facilities,  with
repayment  required over the 12-month  period  following  resolution of the work
stoppage. (See Electric Sales - Large Power Customer Contracts.)

         The Company also has contracts  with large  industrial  and  commercial
customers  who have  monthly  demands  of more  than 2 MW but less than 10 MW of
capacity  (Large Light and Power  Customers).  The terms of these contracts vary
depending  upon the  customers'  demand for power and the cost of extending  the
Company's facilities to provide electric service.  Generally,  the contracts for
less than 3 MW have  one-year  terms and the  contracts  ranging from 3 to 10 MW
have initial  five-year  terms.  The Company's rate schedule for Large Light and
Power Customers is designed to minimize fluctuations in revenue and to recover a
significant portion of the fixed costs of providing service to such customers.

         The Company requires that all large industrial and commercial customers
under contract specify the date when power is first required, and thereafter the
customer  is billed for at least the  minimum  power for which they  contracted.
These conditions are part of all contracts  covering power to be supplied to new
large  industrial  and  commercial  customers and to current  customers as their
contracts expire or are amended. All contracts provide that new rates which have
been  approved  by  appropriate   regulatory  authorities  will  be  substituted
immediately  for obsolete  rates,  without  regard to any unexpired  term of the
existing  contract.  All rate  schedules are subject to approval by  appropriate
regulatory authorities.

         FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

         The FERC has jurisdiction over the Company's wholesale electric service
resale customers and transmission service (wheeling) customers.

         The Company has long-term  contracts  with 15 Minnesota  municipalities
receiving  resale service.  Two contracts are for service through 2002 and 2004,
while the other 13 are for service  through at least 2007.  The contracts  limit
rate  increases  (including  fuel  costs)  to  about  2  percent  per  year on a
cumulative basis. In 1997 the 15 municipal  customers purchased 615,422 MWh from
the Company.

         A contract  between  Minnesota  Power and SWL&P  provides  for SWL&P to
purchase  its power from the  Company  through  at least  2010 and  limits  rate
increases  (including  fuel costs) to about 2 percent  per year on a  cumulative
basis. SWL&P purchased 564,200 MWh from the Company in 1997.

         The Company also has a contract  through 2004 to supply  electricity to
Dahlberg  Light and  Power  Company  (Dahlberg),  a  private  utility.  Dahlberg
purchased 86,434 MWh from the Company in 1997.

         The Company's hydroelectric facilities, which are located in Minnesota,
are  licensed  by the FERC.  In 1995 the FERC  issued  to the  Company a 30-year
license  for the St.  Louis  River  hydroelectric  project  (87.6 MW  generating
capability).  In 1996 the FERC  extended  the  license  term from 30 to 40 years
because  of certain  mandates  to  mitigate  environmental  consequences  of the
project.  In May  1997  the FERC  issued  an  annual  license  for the  Pillager
hydroelectric project (1.5 MW generating  capability) under the existing license
terms and conditions.  This annual license is effective until the new license is
issued. (See Environmental Matters - Water.)

         MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

         The  Company's  retail rates are based on a 1994 MPUC retail rate order
which  allows for an  11.6 percent return on common equity devoted to utility
plant.

         Minnesota requires investor owned electric utilities to spend a minimum
of  1.5  percent  of  gross  annual  retail  electric  revenue  on  conservation
improvement  programs  (CIP) each year.  The MPUC  approved a minimum  statutory
spending  requirement  of $5.1  million for 1997 ($5.1  million  for 1996;  $5.3
million for 1995).  In 1997 the Company spent $5.8 million on CIP ($14.4 million
in 1996;  $14.2  million in 1995) and expects to spend a total of $11.9  million
during 1998. The MPUC allows such conservation 

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

expenditures  in  excess  of  amounts  recovered  through  current  rates  to be
accumulated  in a  deferred  account  for  future  recovery.  Through  a billing
adjustment and retail base rates approved by the MPUC, the Company is allowed to
recover current and deferred CIP expenditures,  a carrying charge on unrecovered
expenditures  and the lost  margins  associated  with power saved as a result of
these  programs.  The Company  collected CIP related revenue of $13.7 million in
1997 ($10.8 million in 1996 and 1995).

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM

         Capital expenditures for Electric Operations totaled $35 million during
1997. Internally generated funds and long-term financing were used to fund these
capital  expenditures.  Electric Operations capital expenditures are expected to
be $44 million in 1998 and total  approximately  $144 million  during the period
1999 through 2002. The 1998 amount is for electric system component  replacement
and upgrades, telecommunication fiber and coal handling equipment. The Company's
estimates of such capital  expenditures and the sources of financing are subject
to continuing review and adjustment.

COMPETITION

         The electric utility  industry  continues to become more competitive at
both the  wholesale  and retail  levels.  This is  particularly  the case in the
wholesale  markets.  Retail  deregulation of the industry is being considered at
both the federal and state level, and effects the way the Company  strategically
views the future.  With electric rates among the lowest in the United States and
with  long-term  wholesale and Large Power Customer  retail  contracts in place,
Minnesota Power believes Electric  Operations are well positioned to address and
benefit from competitive pressures.

         WHOLESALE

         Minnesota  Power's MPEX  division  conducts an active  wholesale  power
marketing and trading  business,  including  participation  in the new power and
energy  markets  within the  Mid-Continent  Area  Power Pool and other  regional
reliability  councils.  In 1997  Manitoba  Hydro and  Minnesota  Power  signed a
three-year  agreement  whereby MPEX will provide  Manitoba  Hydro with exclusive
hourly power trading and energy scheduling  services in the United States.  This
agreement  became  effective  January 1, 1998.  Also in 1997 Manitoba  Hydro and
Minnesota  Power  signed a  memorandum  of  understanding  that  establishes  an
alliance  whereby the two utilities are and will market  electric  energy in the
Midwest,  including  but not limited to Wisconsin,  Michigan and Illinois.  This
memorandum strengthens the international relationship beyond the wholesale power
trading  agreement.  Manitoba  Hydro is the fourth largest  electric  utility in
Canada.  More than a third of Manitoba Hydro's electric sales represent  exports
of renewable  hydroelectricity to the United States and neighboring provinces in
Canada.  MPEX  is  reviewing  new  strategic  opportunities  for  its  wholesale
marketing  operations in light of the new Open Access Transmission Rules enacted
by the FERC in 1996.  The Company also has wholesale  contracts with a number of
municipal  customers.   (See  Regulatory  Issues  -  Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission.)

         In 1996 the Company completed  functional  unbundling of its operations
under FERC Order No. 888, "Open Access Transmission  Rules." This order requires
public  utilities  to  take   transmission   service  for  their  own  wholesale
transactions under the same terms and conditions on which  transmission  service
is  provided  to third  parties.  Also in 1996 the  Company  filed  its "Code of
Conduct" under FERC Order No. 889, "Open Access Same Time Information System and
Standards of Conduct," which formalized the functional  separation of generation
from  transmission  within  the  organization.  The  transmission  component  of
Electric  Operations is organized for and  conducting  business  under these new
federal regulatory requirements. (See Item 2. Properties - Electric Operations.)

         RETAIL

         In 1995  the  MPUC  initiated  an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  in the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery  of  electric   service   continues  to  be  efficient   following  any
restructuring,  the MPUC adopted 15 principles to guide a deliberate and orderly
approach to developing  reasonable  restructuring  alternatives  that ensure the
fairness of a  competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January
1996  the  MPUC  established  a  competition  working  group  in  which  company
representatives  have participated in addressing issues related to wholesale and
retail competition.  The 

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

working group issued a Wholesale Competition Report in October 1996 and a Retail
Competition  Report in November 1997. The MPUC is expected to begin  identifying
the steps necessary to successfully  implement  restructuring  upon receipt of a
legislative mandate.

         LEGISLATION

         During  1998  Congress  is  expected  to  continue  to debate  proposed
legislation  which,  if  enacted,  would  promote  customer  choice  and a  more
competitive  electric  market.  The  Company is  actively  participating  in the
dialogue and debate on these issues in various  forums,  principally to advocate
fairness  and  parity for all power and energy  competitors  in any  deregulated
markets that may be created by new  legislation.  While Congress is not expected
to pass  legislation in 1998, the Company cannot predict the timing or substance
of any future  legislation  which  might  ultimately  be enacted.  However,  the
Company will take the necessary steps to maintain its competitive  position as a
low-cost and long-term supplier to large industrial customers.

         Legislative  activity is evolving both in Minnesota and  Wisconsin.  An
electric  Energy Task Force comprised of  representatives  of both houses of the
Minnesota legislature continues to study a variety of issues related to industry
restructuring.  In Minnesota  legislation has been introduced,  but the Governor
and  legislative  leadership  have indicated  that no action to restructure  the
industry  will be taken in 1998.  The  Company is also  promoting  property  tax
reform  before the Minnesota  legislature  in order to eliminate the taxation of
personal  property that results in an  inequitable  tax burden among current and
potential  competitors in local markets.  The Wisconsin  legislature is pursuing
electric utility industry restructuring,  including the possible formation of an
independent transmission system operator within the state.

FRANCHISES

         Minnesota Power holds  franchises to construct and maintain an electric
distribution and  transmission  system in 85 cities and towns located within its
electric service territory. SWL&P holds franchises in 15 cities and towns within
its service  territory.  The remaining  cities and towns served do not require a
franchise to operate within their boundaries.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Certain  businesses  included  in  the  Company's  Electric  Operations
segment  are  subject  to  regulation  by  various  federal,   state  and  local
authorities with respect to air quality,  water quality,  solid wastes and other
environmental   matters.  The  Company  considers  these  businesses  to  be  in
substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable
to its operations and believes all necessary  permits to conduct such operations
have been  obtained.  The Company does not currently  anticipate  that potential
capital  expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be  material.  However,
because  environmental  laws  and  regulations  are  constantly  evolving,   the
character,  scope  and  ultimate  costs of  environmental  compliance  cannot be
estimated.

         AIR

         CLEAN AIR ACT. The federal Clean Air Act  Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air
Act) require that specified fossil-fueled  generating plants obtain air emission
permits from the EPA (or, when delegated,  from  individual  state and pollution
control  agencies),  and meet new sulfur  dioxide and  nitrogen  oxide  emission
standards  beginning January 1, 1995 (Phase I) and that virtually all generating
plants meet more strict emission standards beginning January 1, 2000 (Phase II).
None of  Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities  are  covered by the Phase I
requirements  of the  Clean  Air Act  for  sulfur  dioxide.  However,  Phase  II
requirements apply to the Company's Boswell,  Laskin and Hibbard plants, as well
as Square Butte.

         The Clean Air Act creates emission  allowances for sulfur dioxide based
on formulas  relating to the  permitted  1985  emissions  rate and a baseline of
average fossil fuel consumed in the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. Each allowance is
an authorization  to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide,  and each utility must have
sufficient   allowances  to  cover  its  annual  emissions.   Minnesota  Power's
generating  facilities  in  Minnesota  burn mainly  low-sulfur  western coal and
Square  Butte,  located  in  North  Dakota,  burns  lignite  coal.  All of these
facilities  are equipped with  pollution  control  equipment  such as scrubbers,
baghouses  or  electrostatic  precipitators.  Phase II sulfur  dioxide  emission
requirements are currently being met by Boswell Unit 4. Some moderate reductions
in emissions  may be necessary  for Boswell Units 1, 2 and 3, 

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Laskin  Units 1 and 2, and  Square  Butte to meet the  Phase II  sulfur  dioxide
emission  requirements.  The Company believes it is in a good position to comply
with the sulfur dioxide standards without extensive modifications.  Any required
reductions at the Minnesota  generating  facilities  are expected to be achieved
through the use of lower  sulfur  coal.  Square  Butte  anticipates  meeting its
sulfur dioxide  requirements  through increased use of existing  scrubbers or by
purchasing  additional  allowances.  The estimated  cost to meet sulfur  dioxide
requirements at Square Butte is $500,000 to $600,000 per year.

         Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the EPA has  established  nitrogen oxide
limitations  for Phase II  generating  units.  To meet Phase II  nitrogen  oxide
limitations,  the  Company has spent $4.2  million and will spend an  additional
$1.8 million in 1998 on advanced low emission  burner  technology and associated
control  equipment to operate the Boswell and Laskin  facilities at or below the
compliance standards.  Options for complying with the nitrogen oxide limitations
at Square Butte are being studied at this time and include operational  changes,
capital  expenditures  and  seeking  regulatory  relief.  The EPA decided not to
promulgate nitrogen oxide limitations for the type of boilers at Hibbard.

         The Company has obtained all necessary  Title V air  operating  permits
from the MPCA for applicable facilities to conduct its electric operations.

         CLIMATE CHALLENGE.  The Company is participating in a voluntary program
(Climate  Challenge)  with the United  States  Department  of Energy to identify
activities  that the Company has taken and additional  measures that the Company
may undertake on a voluntary basis that will result in  limitations,  reductions
or  sequestrations of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. The Company has
agreed to participate in this voluntary program provided that such participation
is consistent with the Company's integrated resource planning process,  does not
have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  competitive  position  with
respect to rates and costs,  and  continues to be  acceptable  to the  Company's
regulators.  The costs to Minnesota  Power  associated  with  Climate  Challenge
participation are minor, reflecting program facilitation and voluntary reporting
costs.

         KYOTO  PROTOCOL.  On  December  11, 1997 the United  Nations  Framework
Convention on Climate Change agreed upon a draft international treaty, the Kyoto
Protocol (Protocol), which, if ratified, would call for reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions.  The United  States'  target is to achieve a 7 percent  reduction
below  1990  emission  levels by the  period  2008-2012.  The  Protocol  must be
ratified by the United  States Senate by March 15, 1999;  however,  the Protocol
does not currently  satisfy the guidance  provided in a 1997 Senate  resolution.
The Company  currently  cannot  predict when or if the Protocol will be ratified
nor can it determine the impact such ratification would have on the Company.

         WATER

         The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA),  as amended by
the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987,  established  the
National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System (NPDES) permit program.  The
FWPCA requires that NPDES permits be obtained from the EPA (or, when  delegated,
from individual state pollution control agencies) for any wastewater  discharged
into  navigable  waters.  The Company has obtained all necessary  NPDES permits,
including  NPDES storm water permits for applicable  facilities,  to conduct its
electric operations.

(a) The FERC issued an annual license to the Company under the existing  license
    terms and conditions. This annual license is effective until the new license
    is issued. An application to relicense this facility was filed with the FERC
    on May 11, 1995.  The FERC will perform an  engineering,  environmental  and
    economic analysis of that application in order to determine whether to issue
    a new  license  for the  project.  FERC  scoping  meetings  to  discuss  any
    environmental  and  operational  issues related to this project were held in
    October  1996 with the  resource  agencies  and the  public.  The FERC staff
    sought input related to any water quality,  fishery,  terrestrial,  cultural
    and  recreation  issues that the agencies and public have prior to preparing
    the  environmental  assessment  for this project.  To date,  no  substantive
    issues  have  been  raised by the  resource  agencies  or the  public in the
    license process.
(b) The Company is currently in the planning  stages for the relicensing of this
    facility.
(c) The  Company  filed a request  for  rehearing  of the  FERC's  order for the
    purpose of challenging certain terms and conditions of the license which, if
    accepted by the Company, would alter the Company's operation of the project.
    In 1996 the FERC issued an order on rehearing  in response to the  rehearing
    request and  extended  the license  term from 30 to 40 years  because of the
    anticipated  impact  of  the  FERC's  mandates  to  mitigate   environmental
    consequences of the project. The FERC also directed the Company to negotiate
    with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake  Superior  Chippewa  (Fond du Lac  Band) a
    reasonable annual charge for the use of tribal lands within the project.  In
    June 1996 the Company filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
    Columbia Circuit a petition for review of the license as issued by the FERC.
    Separate petitions for review were also filed in June 1996 in the same court
    by the  U.S.  Department  of the  Interior  and the  Fond du Lac  Band,  two
    intervenors in the licensing proceedings.  The issues to be resolved concern
    the terms and  conditions  of the license  which will  govern the  Company's
    operation  and   maintenance  of  the  project.   In  July  1996  the  court
    consolidated  the three  petitions  for review.  In October 1996 the Company
    filed with the court an unopposed motion for a procedural  schedule pursuant
    to which the  briefing of the issues  would be  completed  in May 1997.  The
    motion was granted by the court;  however,  the  briefing  schedule has been
    suspended  while  the  Company  and  the  Fond  du Lac  Band  negotiate  the
    reasonable fee for use of tribal lands as mandated by the new license.  Both
    parties have  informed the court that these  negotiations  may resolve other
    disputed issues,  and they are obligated to report to the court periodically
    the status of these  discussions.  Beginning in 1996,  and most  recently in
    February  1998,  the Company filed  requests with the FERC for extensions of
    time to comply with certain plans and studies  required by the license which
    might  conflict  with  the  settlement  discussions.  The  FERC  granted  an
    extension until August 1, 1998 to comply with those requirements.

         SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE

         The  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act of 1976  regulates  the
management and disposal of solid wastes.  As a result of this  legislation,  the
EPA has promulgated  various  hazardous waste rules.  The Company is required to
notify the EPA of hazardous  waste activity and routinely  submits the necessary
annual reports to the EPA.

         In response to EPA Region V's request for utilities to  participate  in
their Great Lakes Initiative by voluntarily  removing remaining  polychlorinated
biphenyl   (PCB)   inventories,   the  Company  has  scheduled   replacement  of
PCB-contaminated  oil from  substation  equipment by 2000 and the removal of PCB
capacitors by 2006. The total cost is expected to be between $1.5 million and $2
million of which  $400,000 was expended  through  December 31, 1997. The Company
expects to spend about $110,000 in 1998.

         MINING CONTROL AND RECLAMATION

         BNI Coal's mining operations are governed by the Federal Surface Mining
Control  and  Reclamation  Act of 1977.  This Act,  together  with the rules and
regulations  adopted  thereunder by the  Department  of the Interior,  Office of
Surface  Mining  Reclamation  and  Enforcement  (OSM),  governs the  approval or
disapproval of all mining permits on federally owned land and the actions of the
OSM in approving or disapproving  state regulatory  programs  regulating  mining
activities.  The North Dakota Reclamation of Strip Mined Lands Act and rules and
regulations  enacted  thereunder in 1969, as  subsequently  amended by the North
Dakota Mining and Reclamation Act and rules and regulations  enacted  thereunder
in 1977,  govern the  reclamation  of surface  mined lands and are  generally as
stringent or more stringent than the federal rules and  regulations.  Compliance
is monitored  by the North Dakota  Public  Service  Commission.  The federal and
state laws and  regulations  require a wide range of procedures  including water
management,  topsoil and subsoil segregation,  stockpiling and revegetation, and
the posting of performance bonds to assure compliance. In general these laws and
regulations require the reclaiming of mined lands to a level of usefulness equal
to or greater than that available  before active mining.  The Company  considers
BNI Coal to be in substantial  compliance with those  environmental  regulations
currently  applicable to its  operations  and believes all necessary  permits to
conduct such operations have been obtained.

                                 WATER SERVICES

         Water  Services are  comprised of regulated  and  non-regulated  wholly
owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company.  Water  Services  have  been  laying  the
groundwork  for  future  growth in  several  new  areas of the  water  business.
Non-regulated   subsidiaries  have  initiated   marketing  the  Company's  water
expertise outside traditional utility boundaries.

         REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

         -    FLORIDA  WATER,  the largest  investor  owned  water  supplier in
              Florida,   owns  and  operates  water  and  wastewater   treatment
              facilities  within that state.  As of  December  31, 1997  Florida
              Water  served  119,000  water  customers  and  52,000   wastewater
              treatment customers.

              In 1997 Florida Water sold certain water and wastewater assets to
              Orange  County in Florida for $13.1  million.  These assets served
              about 4,000 customers.  The transaction resulted in a $4.7 million
              after-tax gain.

              and 2,000 wastewater treatment customers.
              
              In 1997 the NCUC  approved  the  transfer of LaGrange  Waterworks
              Corporation  (LaGrange) to Heater.  The Company  exchanged  96,000
              shares of common stock, with a market value of approximately  $3.4
              million,  for the outstanding shares of LaGrange.  The transaction
              was  accounted  for as a pooling of  interest.  LaGrange  provides
              water services to approximately 5,300 customers near Fayetteville,
              North Carolina.

REGULATORY ISSUES

         FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION

         -    1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Florida First District Court
              of  Appeals  (Court  of  Appeals)   reversed  a  1993  FPSC  order
              establishing  uniform  rates for most of Florida  Water's  service
              areas.  With  "uniform  rates," all customers in each uniform rate
              area pay the same  rates  for water and  wastewater  services.  In
              response to the Court of Appeals'  order,  in August 1996 the FPSC
              ordered Florida Water to issue refunds to those customers who paid
              more since  October 1993 under  uniform rates than they would have
              paid  under  stand-alone  rates.  This  order  did  not  permit  a
              balancing  surcharge  to  customers  who paid less  under  uniform
              rates.  Florida Water appealed,  and the Court of Appeals ruled in
              June 1997 that the FPSC could not order refunds without  balancing
              surcharges.  In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the FPSC
              issued an order on January 26, 1998 that would not require Florida
              Water to refund about $12.5 million,  which included interest,  to
              customers who paid more under uniform rates.

              In the same  January 26, 1998 order,  the FPSC  required  Florida
              Water to refund $2.5 million,  the amount paid by customers in the
              Spring Hill service area from January 1996 through June 1997 under
              uniform rates which exceeded the amount these customers would have
              paid under a modified  stand-alone  rate  structure.  No balancing
              surcharge  was  permitted.  The FPSC ordered  this refund  because
              Spring Hill  customers  continued to pay uniform rates after other
              customers  began  paying  modified   stand-alone  rates  effective
              January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's  interim rate order in Florida
              Water's  1995 Rate Case.  The FPSC did not include  Spring Hill in
              this  interim  rate order  because  Hernando  County  had  assumed
              jurisdiction  over Spring Hill's rates. In June 1997 Florida Water
              reached an agreement with Hernando County to revert to stand-alone
              rates for Spring Hill customers.

              Customer groups which paid more under uniform rates have appealed
              the FPSC's  January 26, 1998 order.  The Company has also appealed
              the $2.5 million  refund  order.  No provision for refund has been
              recorded.

         -    1995 RATE CASE.  Florida  Water  requested an $18.1  million rate
              increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers  of
              Florida  Water  regulated  by the FPSC.  In October  1996 the FPSC
              issued its final order approving an $11.1 million annual increase.
              In November  1996 Florida Water filed with the Court of Appeals an
              appeal of the FPSC's final order seeking judicial review of issues
              relating  to  the  amount  of  investment  in  utility  facilities
              recoverable in rates from current customers.  Other parties to the
              rate case also filed appeals.  In June 1997, as part of the review
              process,  the FPSC  allowed  Florida  Water to  resume  collecting
              approximately  $1 million,  on an annual  basis,  in new  customer
              connection  fees.  Oral  argument  on the  appeal was heard by the
              Court of Appeals on February  10,  1998.  The Company is unable to
              predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

         -    HILLSBOROUGH  COUNTY  RATES.  On July 2, 1997 Florida Water filed
              for  a  rate  change  with  the   Hillsborough   County  Utilities
              Department.  Florida  Water  filed  for  an  annual  interim  rate

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

              increase of $848,845  (43.1  percent) and a final rate increase of
              $877,607 (44.6 percent).  Interim rates became effective on August
              18, 1997.  Hearings are scheduled for April, May and June 1998. It
              is anticipated  that final rates will be implemented in July 1998.
              The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this case.

         NORTH CAROLINA UTILITIES COMMISSION

         On  September  30, 1997 Heater  filed with the NCUC for a $1.1  million
annual increase for its water and wastewater customers.  The hearing was held on
March 10,  1998.  The annual  increase  in  operating  revenue is expected to be
$343,000.  The test year was adjusted for customer growth and consumption  which
substantially  decreased the annual rate increase  required.  A final order from
the NCUC is expected in May 1998.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM

         Capital  expenditures  for Water  Services  totaled $22 million  during
1997.   Expenditures  were  funded  with  internally  generated  funds.  Capital
expenditures  for the Company's Water Services are expected to be $22 million in
1998 to meet  environmental  standards,  expand water and  wastewater  treatment
facilities  to  accommodate   customer  growth,   and  for  water   conservation
initiatives.  Capital  expenditures  are  expected to total  approximately  $110
million during the period 1999 through 2002.

COMPETITION

         Water Services provide water and wastewater services at regulated rates
within exclusive service territories granted by regulators.

         With  respect  to  non-regulated   businesses  within  Water  Services,
significant  competition  exists  for the  provision  of the  types of  services
provided by Americas' Water.  Although a few private contractors control a large
percentage of the market for contract  management,  operations  and  maintenance
services,  the Company believes that the current and anticipated  growth in that
market will allow for emerging companies like Americas' Water to succeed.

FRANCHISES

         Florida Water provides water and wastewater  treatment  services in 21
counties  regulated by the FPSC and holds  franchises in three  counties which
have retained  authority to regulate such  operations.  (See  Regulatory Issues
- - - - Florida Public Service Commission.)

         Water  and  wastewater  services  provided  by  Heater  are  under  the
jurisdiction of the NCUC. The commission  grants franchises for Heater's service
territory when the rates are authorized.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         The  Company's  Water  Services  are subject to  regulation  by various
federal, state and local authorities with respect to water quality, solid wastes
and other  environmental  matters.  The Company  considers  these  businesses to
generally  be in  compliance  with  those  environmental  regulations  currently
applicable  to its  operations  and have the permits  necessary  to conduct such
operations.  The Company does not currently  anticipate  that potential  capital
expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be  material.  However,  because
environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the character, scope
and ultimate costs of environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

         UNIVERSITY SHORES AND SEABOARD FACILITIES

         In 1993 the EPA  notified  Florida  Water  of  alleged  exceedences  of
effluent  limitations in its NPDES permit for Florida Water's  University Shores
wastewater  facility in Orange County,  Florida.  During 1993 and 1994,  Florida
Water  periodically  corresponded  and met with the EPA  concerning  the alleged
exceedences  of the permit.  The matters at issue were resolved in February 1994
when the  University  Shores  facility  was modified  such that  effluent was no
longer  discharged to surface waters.  In 1992 the EPA notified Florida Water of
alleged  exceedences  of effluent  limitations  in the NPDES  permit for Florida
Water's Seaboard wastewater treatment facility in Hillsborough County,  Florida.
Between 1992 and 1994, 

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Florida Water periodically  corresponded and met with the EPA concerning alleged
exceedences of the permit. In March 1994 the matters at issue were resolved when
the  facility  was  taken  out  of  service  and  the   collection   system  was
interconnected  with the  City of Tampa  utilities.  In 1997 the  United  States
Department of Justice (DOJ),  on behalf of the EPA,  served Florida Water with a
complaint in a civil action in the U.S.  District Court for the Middle  District
of Florida  (District  Court).  The suit sought  civil  penalties  not to exceed
$25,000 per day for each alleged violation of effluent  limitations in the NPDES
permits  occurring at the University Shores and Seaboard  wastewater  facilities
from February 1992 through  March 1994. In 1998 Florida  Water,  the DOJ and the
EPA executed a Consent  Decree as a settlement of the  complaint  filed in 1997.
The Consent  Decree  requires  Florida  Water to pay a $250,000  civil  penalty;
complete a Supplemental Environmental Project totaling $200,000; and complete an
additional  environmental  project totaling $450,000.  After a 30 day period for
notice and public  comment,  the Consent  Decree will be filed with the District
Court for approval.

                               AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

         Automotive  Services  include  wholly owned  subsidiaries  operating as
integral  parts of the vehicle  auction  business:  ADESA,  a network of vehicle
auctions; AFC, a finance company; and Great Rigs, an auto transport company. The
Company acquired 80  percent  of  ADESA, including  AFC and Great Rigs, on  July
1, 1995. The Company  increased its ownership  interest to 83 percent in January
1996 and acquired the remaining 17 percent  interest in August 1996.  Automotive
Services plans on growth through selective acquisitions and expanding services.

         -    ADESA is the third largest  vehicle auction network in the United
              States.  Headquartered  in Indianapolis,  Indiana,  ADESA owns and

              production  offices which are located at most ADESA  auctions,  as
              well as at or near independently  owned auto auctions.  From these
              offices car dealers  obtain credit to purchase  vehicles at any of
              the over 300  auctions  approved by AFC.  During 1997 AFC added 25
              loan production  offices. In early 1998 three more loan production
              offices were added.

         -    GREAT  RIGS  is one  of the  nation's  largest  independent  used
              automobile  transport carriers with 110 leased automotive carriers
              operating  as an integral  part of the vehicle  auction  business.
              Headquartered in Moody, Alabama,  Great Rigs offers customers pick
              up and delivery  through 11 strategically  located  transportation
              hubs.  Customers  of  Great  Rigs  include  ADESA  auctions,   car
              dealerships,  vehicle  manufacturers,  leasing companies,  finance
              companies and other auctions.  Major customers include GE Capital,
              Nissan,  Ford Motor Credit and General Motors  Acceptance Corp. By
              the end of second  quarter 1998,  Great Rigs expects to expand its
              fleet to 150 automobile carriers.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM

         Capital   expenditures   for   automobile   auction  site   relocation,
development  and facility  improvements  were $11 million  during 1997.  Capital
expenditures for Automotive  Services are expected to be $24 million in 1998 and
to total  approximately $47 million during the period 1999 through 2002. Capital

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
expenditures  in 1998 are for on-going  improvements  and relocation of existing
vehicle auction facilities, and associated information systems.

COMPETITION

         Within the automobile auction industry,  ADESA's  competition  includes
independently  owned  auctions  as well as major  chains and  associations  with
auctions in  geographic  proximity.  ADESA  competes  with other  auctions for a
supply of vehicles to be sold on consignment for automobile  dealers,  financial
institutions  and other  sellers.  ADESA  also  competes  for a supply of rental
repurchase vehicles from automobile  manufacturers for auction at factory sales.
Automobile  manufacturers often choose between auctions across multi-state areas
in distributing rental repurchase  vehicles.  ADESA competes for these customers
by attempting to attract a large number of dealers to purchase  vehicles,  which
ensures competitive prices and supports the volume of vehicles auctioned.  ADESA
also competes by providing a full range of services  including  dealer inventory
financing,   reconditioning   services  which  prepare   vehicles  for  auction,
transporting  vehicles and the prompt processing of sale  transactions.  Another
factor affecting the industry,  the impact of which is yet to be determined,  is
the  entrance  of large  used car  dealerships  called  "superstores"  that have
emerged in densely populated markets.

         AFC is well positioned as a provider of floorplan financing services to
the used vehicle industry.  AFC's competition  includes other specialty lenders,
as well as banks and other  financial  institutions.  AFC  competes  with  other
floorplan providers and strives to distinguish itself based upon convenience and
quality of service.  A key  component of AFC's program is  conveniently  located
loan production  offices with personnel  available to assist automobile  dealers
with  their  financing  needs.  As part of AFC's  continued  effort  to focus on
providing  other  financing  services  to dealers,  in 1997 AFC entered  into an
agreement  with ACC Consumer  Finance Corp.  (ACC).  ACC has  subsequently  been
acquired by Household  International.  Together  these two companies will test a
program designed to promote ACC's retail financing of used vehicles floorplanned
by AFC.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Certain  businesses in the Company's  Automotive  Services  segment are
subject to  regulation  by various  federal,  state and local  authorities  with
respect to air quality,  water  quality,  solid  wastes and other  environmental
matters. The Company considers these businesses to be in substantial  compliance
with those environmental  regulations currently applicable to its operations and
believes all necessary  permits to conduct such  operations  have been obtained.
The Company does not currently  anticipate that potential  capital  expenditures
for environmental matters will be material.  However, because environmental laws
and regulations are constantly evolving, the character, scope and ultimate costs
of environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

                                   INVESTMENTS

         The  Investments  segment is comprised of a  securities  portfolio,  an
investment in a financial guaranty  reinsurance and insurance company,  and real
estate operations.

         PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE

         -    SECURITIES  PORTFOLIO.  The  Company's  securities  portfolio  is
              managed by selected outside managers as well as internal managers.
              It is intended to provide stable  earnings and  liquidity,  and is
              available for investment in existing businesses,  acquisitions and
              other corporate  purposes.  The Company's objective is to maintain
              corporate  liquidity  between 7 percent  and 10  percent  of total
              assets  ($150  million  to $200  million).  The  Company  plans to
              continue to concentrate in  market-neutral  investment  strategies
              designed  to  provide  stable  and  acceptable   returns   without
              sacrificing needed liquidity.  The securities  portfolio is hedged
              against market  downturns and aimed at an after-tax return between
              7 percent  and 9 percent.  While  these  returns  may seem  modest
              compared to broader market indices over the past three years,  the
              Company believes its hedge strategy is a wise course in a volatile
              economic

                                      -16-

              environment.  Returns  will  continue  to  be  partially dependent
              on general market conditions.  The Company's  investment in the 
              securities  portfolio at December 31, 1997 was $184 million
              ($155 million at December 31, 1996).

         -    REINSURANCE.  Minnesota  Power owns 3.3 million shares of Capital
              Re, a specialty insurance and reinsurance  business.  Capital Re's
              product lines  currently  include  financial  guaranty,  mortgage,
              title, financial, credit and specialty reinsurance,  and specialty
              insurance through its  participation in Lloyds of London.  Capital
              Re trades on the New York Stock  Exchange  under the  symbol  KRE.
              Minnesota  Power's  ownership  represents  21  percent  of  the 16
              million total  outstanding  shares of Capital Re. The market value
              of the  Company's  investment  in Capital  Re was $203  million at
              December  31, 1997 ($152  million at December 31, 1996) based on a
              Capital Re share price of $62 5/16 ($46 5/8 at December 31, 1996).
              The Company  accounts for its  investment  in Capital Re under the
              equity method and the carrying  value was $119 million at December
              31, 1997.  Capital Re will continue to be a core  component of the
              Company's Investment segment.

         -    OTHER.  Since 1985 the Company has invested about $8 million as a
              shareholder in Utech Venture Capital  Corporation  (Utech).  Utech
              manages a group of  venture  capital  funds  that  seek  long-term
              capital appreciation by making investments in companies developing
              advanced  technologies  to be used by the  utility  industry.  The
              Company is committed to invest an additional  $14 million over the
              next five years.  Minnesota  Power has  recognized  dividends  and
              return of  capital  from the  funds in the year they are paid.  As
              successful  companies  "go  public" or are sold,  investors,  like
              Minnesota  Power,  may realize income as the stock is sold and the
              cash distributed. 
              
              In  1997   Minnesota   Power  loaned  $4  million  to  Car  Canada
              Corporation,  a start-up  retail car  "superstore"  business  with
              stores in Ottawa and Toronto.  The Company holds a 10 percent note
              due 2002 for the principal  amount of the loan.  The note has five
              equal  payments  due at the end of years  one  through  five.  The
              Company also holds  detachable  warrants that can be exercised for
              25 percent of the outstanding shares of Car Canada in exchange for
              approximately $18,000. The warrants are exercisable  automatically
              in an initial public offering,  or sale, or merger of the firm and
              any other time at the sole option of Minnesota Power.

         REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS

         The Company owns 80 percent of Lehigh,  a Florida  real estate  company
which owns property in three different locations. The real estate strategy is to
continue to acquire large  community  properties at low cost, add value and sell
them at going market prices.

         -    LEHIGH ACRES  properties  include 2,500 acres of land and  
              approximately  4,000 home sites near Fort Myers, Florida.

         -    SUGARMILL  WOODS  properties  include  1,000 home sites in Citrus
              County, Florida.

         -    PALM COAST  properties  include 2,700 home sites and 12,000 acres
              of  residential,  commercial  and  industrial  land at Palm Coast,
              Florida.  Palm Coast is a planned  community between St. Augustine
              and Daytona Beach.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Certain businesses  included in the Company's  Investments  segment are
subject to  regulation  by various  federal,  state and local  authorities  with
respect to air quality,  water  quality,  solid  wastes and other  environmental
matters. The Company considers these businesses to be in substantial  compliance
with those environmental  regulations currently applicable to its operations and
believes all necessary  permits to conduct such  operations  have been obtained.
The Company does not currently  anticipate that potential  capital  expenditures
for environmental matters will be material.  However, because environmental laws
and regulations are constantly evolving, the character, scope and ultimate costs
of environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

free from other encumbrances,  subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of
such a nature as to  substantially  impair the usefulness to the Company of such
properties. Other property, including certain offices and equipment, is utilized
under  leases.  In general,  some of the electric  lines are located on land not
owned in fee,  but are covered by  necessary  consents  of various  governmental
authorities or by appropriate  rights obtained from owners of private  property.
These  consents  and rights are deemed  adequate  for the purposes for which the
properties  are being used.  In  September  1990 the  Company  sold a portion of
Boswell  Unit 4 to WPPI.  WPPI has the right to use the  Company's  transmission
line facilities to transport its share of generation.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER 
MATTERS.

         The Company has paid dividends without interruption on its common stock
since 1948. A quarterly  dividend of $.51 per share on the common stock was paid
on March 2, 1998 to the holders of record on February  16, 1998.  The  Company's
common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Dividends paid per share,
and the high and low  prices  for the  Company's  common  stock for the  periods
indicated  as reported  by The Wall Street  Journal,  Midwest  Edition,  were as
follows:

- - - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The amount  and timing of  dividends  payable on the  Company's  common
stock are within the sole  discretion  of the Company's  Board of Directors.  In
1997 the Company  paid out 82 percent of its per share  earnings  in  dividends.
Through increased  earnings,  the Company's goal is to reduce dividend payout to
between 75 percent and 80 percent of per share earnings.

         The Company's Articles of Incorporation, and Mortgage and Deed of Trust
contain provisions which under certain  circumstances would restrict the payment
of common stock  dividends.  As of December 31, 1997 no retained  earnings  were
restricted  as a  result  of these  provisions.  At March  2,  1998  there  were
approximately 37,000 common stock shareholders of record.

                         ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE


To the Board of Directors
   of Minnesota Power

Our audits of the consolidated  financial statements referred to in our
report dated January 26, 1998  appearing on page 32 of the 1997 Annual Report to
Shareholders  of  Minnesota  Power  (which  report  and  consolidated  financial
statements  are  incorporated  by reference in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K)
also included an audit of the Financial  Statement Schedule listed in Item 14(a)
of this Form 10-K. In our opinion,  the Financial  Statement  Schedule  presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

All  of  the  Company's   business  segments   reflected   ongoing   operational
improvements in 1997, stemming from sales growth and continued implementation of
the Company's corporate  strategy.  Most significant growth came from Automotive
Services where net income increased nearly four times. Expansion projects were a
success as were  improvements from operations due to cost controls and increased
sales volume.

The Company measures  profitability of its operations  through careful budgeting
and  monitoring of  contributions  by business  segment to corporate net income.
Corporate Charges represent general corporate expenses,  including interest, not
specifically related to any one business segment.

The  following  summarizes  significant  events  which  impacted  the  Company's
earnings  for the past  three  years.  Detailed  discussions  for each  business
segment follow. Abbreviations and acronyms are defined on page 50.

1997. Electric Operations reflected continued strong demand for electricity from
industrial  customers  and  higher  profit  margins  on  sales  to  other  power
suppliers.  Gains from the sale of certain land and other property were balanced
by  start-up  costs   associated   with  strategic   initiatives  and  incentive
compensation  awards  related to total  shareholder  return  performance.  Water
Services showed improved operating efficiencies, a full year of higher rates and
a gain from the sale of certain water and wastewater  assets.  One-time  charges
and start-up costs associated with strategic non-regulated initiatives were also
reflected in Water Services.  Automotive  Services  reported  increased  vehicle
sales and  services at  auctions,  and the  addition  of 25 new loan  production
offices by the financing  business.  A more conservative  allowance for
bad  debts  offset a gain from 

|18


<PAGE>

the sale of excess land.  Investments  recorded increased sales from real estate
operations.  Corporate Charges reflected increased debt service costs to finance
investments in non-regulated operations and various strategic initiatives.

1996. Electric Operations exceeded the record-setting kilowatthour sales of 1995
and established  MPEX, the Company's power  marketing  division.  Water Services
reflected  increased  rates and gains from the  strategic  sale of water assets.
Automotive  Services  included a full twelve months of  operations.  The auction
business added eight auction  facilities,  while the financing business added 13
loan production  offices.  Investments  included the recognition of tax benefits
and the sale of a joint venture from real estate  operations.  Corporate Charges
included  nine months of  distributions  with  respect to  Cumulative  Quarterly
Income Preferred Securities issued in March 1996.

1995.  Electric  Operations  reached  record-setting  kilowatthour  sales. Water
Services  reflected  lower  consumption due to abnormally high rainfall and less
customers  because of the sale of assets in December 1994.  Automotive  Services
reported six months of operations and  significant  start-up costs following the
July 1995  purchase  of  ADESA.  Investments  included  the  recognition  of tax
benefits from real estate  operations.  Corporate Charges included the write-off
of the Company's  investment in Reach All Partnership.  Discontinued  Operations
represented  results  from the  paper and pulp  business  which was sold in June
1995.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Electric  Operations  generate,  transmit,  distribute,  and market electricity.
Minnesota  Power  provides  electricity  to 122,000  customers  in  northeastern
Minnesota,  while the Company's wholly owned subsidiary,  Superior Water,  Light
and Power  Company,  sells  electricity  to 14,000  customers and natural gas to
11,000 customers,  and provides water to 10,000  customers,  all in northwestern
Wisconsin.  Another  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  BNI Coal,  owns and  operates a
lignite  coal  mine in  North  Dakota.  Two  electric  generating  cooperatives,
Minnkota Power Cooperative,  Inc. and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI
Coal's production of lignite coal under contracts extending to 2027.

Electric  Operations  contributed  net income of $43.1  million  in 1997  ($39.4
million  in  1996;  $41.0  million  in  1995).  Financial  performance  for 1997
reflected  solid  operating  results,  which included higher profit margins from
sales to other power suppliers and gains from the sale of certain land and other
property.

ELECTRIC SALES. Total kWh sales were 12.4 billion in 1997 (13.2 billion in 1996,
the record high; 11.5 billion in 1995).  The 6% decline in 1997 was attributable
to restricted market  opportunities for MPEX sales. Less power was available for
sale because of higher prices for  purchased  power,  reduction in  transmission
capability  damaged by severe  spring storms in the Midwest, various  generating
unit  outages  at  Company  and other  plants  in the  Midwest,  and less  hydro
generation  in  Canada.  MPEX is an  expansion  of the  Company's  inter-utility
marketing  group  which has been a buyer and seller of  capacity  and energy for
over 25 years in the  wholesale  power  market.  The customers of MPEX are other
power  suppliers  in the  Midwest  and  Canada.  MPEX  also  contracts  with its
customers to provide hourly energy scheduling and power trading services.


                                                                             19|

The two major  industries in Minnesota  Power's  service  territory are taconite
production,  and paper and pulp mills.  Taconite mining customers  accounted for
31% of electric  operating revenue in 1997 (32% in 1996; 35% in 1995). Paper and
pulp customers  accounted for 12% of electric  operating revenue in 1997 (11% in
1996;  12% in  1995).  In  addition  to these  industries,  sales to  otherpower
suppliers  accounted for 12% of electric operating revenue in 1997 (13% in 1996;
9% in 1995).

Taconite is an important  raw  material for the steel  industry and is made from
low iron content ore mined in northern Minnesota. Taconite processing plants use
large  quantities of electric  power to grind the ore and  concentrate  the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 47
million  tons in 1997  (46  million  tons in 1996;  47  million  tons in  1995).
Minnesota  Power  expects  taconite  production in 1998 to remain at or near the
1997 level.

While  taconite  production  is expected  to  continue at annual  levels over 40
million tons,  the long-term  future of this cyclical  industry is less certain.
Production may decline gradually some time after the year 2008.

LARGE POWER CUSTOMER CONTRACTS.  The Company has electric service contracts with
11 large power  industrial  customers  that require 10 MW or more of power (five
taconite producers, four paper and pulp mills, and two pipeline companies). Each
contract  requires  payment of a minimum  monthly  demand  charge  that covers a
portion of the fixed costs  associated with having  capacity  available to serve
them,  including a return on common  equity.  The demand charge is paid by these
customers even if no electrical  energy is taken.  An energy charge is also paid
to cover the variable cost of energy actually used. The rates and  corresponding
revenue  associated  with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are
subject to change through the regulatory  process  governing all retail electric
rates.

                      Annual Revenue           Megawatts

      1998             $92.1 million              586

      1999             $78.3 million              512

      2000             $69.2 million              465

      2001             $66.5 million              448

      2002             $47.3 million              319
- - - --------------------------------------------------------------
Based on past experience and projected  operating  levels,  the Company believes
revenue  from  large  power  customers  will be  substantially  in excess of the
minimum contract amounts.

In addition to the minimum demand provisions,  contracts with taconite producers
and pipeline companies require these customers to purchase their entire electric
service  requirements  from the Company for the  duration  of the  contract.  In
addition,  six of the large power customers  purchase a combined total of 200 MW
of   interruptible   service   pursuant  to  contractual   commitments   and  an
interruptible  rate  schedule.  Under this schedule and pursuant to  contractual
commitments, the Company has the right to serve 100 MW of these customers' needs
through Oct.  31, 2008,  and another 100 MW of these  customers'  needs  through
April  30,  2010.  The  Company  has the  right  of  first  refusal  to serve an
additional 200 MW during these same time periods.

Contract  termination  dates range from October 1999 to July 2008. Each contract
continues after the contract  termination  date,  unless the required  four-year
advance notice of cancellation has been given. These contract  termination dates
exclude any interruptible service commitments. Minnesota Power has implemented a
key account management process and anticipates continuing  negotiations with its
large  industrial and  commercial  customers to explore  contractual  options to
lower energy  costs.  During 1996 and 1997 the Company  successfully  negotiated
extended  contracts with six of its large power customers.  Contract  extensions
with two more large power customers are pending MPUC approvals.

FUEL.  The cost of coal is the Company's  largest  single  operating  expense in
generating electricity. Coal consumption at the Company's generating stations in
1997 was 4.1  million  tons.  Minnesota  Power  currently  has three coal supply
agreements in place with Montana  suppliers.  Two terminate in December 1999 and
the other in December 2000.  Under these  agreements the Company has the tonnage
flexibility to procure 70% to 100% of its total coal  requirements.  The Company
uses this  flexibility  to  purchase  coal  under  spot-market  agreements  when
favorable  market  conditions  exist.  The Company is  exploring  future  supply
options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal
will  continue  to be  available.  The  Company has  contracts  with  Burlington
Northern  Santa Fe  Railroad  to deliver  coal from  Montana  and Wyoming to the
Company's generating facilities in Minnesota through December 2003.

PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT.  Under an agreement extending through 2007 with Square
Butte,  Minnesota Power purchases 71% (about 317 MW during the summer months and
322 MW during the winter months) of the output of a mine-mouth  generating  unit
located  near  Center,  North  Dakota.  The  Square  Butte  unit  is  one of two
lignite-fired units at Minnkota Power  Cooperative's  Milton R. Young Generating
Station.

Square  Butte has the option,  upon a five year  advance  notice,  to reduce the
Company's  share of the unit's  output to 49%.  Minnesota  Power has the option,
though  not the  obligation,  to  continue  to  purchase  49% of the  output  at
market-based  prices  after  2007  to  the  end of the  plant's  economic  life.
Minnesota  Power must pay any Square Butte costs and expenses that have not been
paid by Square Butte when due, regardless of whether or not the Company receives
any power from that unit.

COMPETITION.  The  electric  utility  industry  continues  to evolve at both the
wholesale and retail levels.  This has resulted in a more competitive market for
electricity generally and particularly in wholesale markets. Retail deregulation
of the industry is being  considered  at both the federal and state  level,  and
affects the way the Company  strategically views the future. With electric rates
among the lowest in the U.S. and with long-term wholesale and large power retail
contracts in place,  Minnesota  Power believes its Electric  Operations are well
positioned to address and benefit from competitive pressures.

WHOLESALE.  Minnesota  Power's MPEX division  conducts an active wholesale power
marketing and trading business.  On Dec. 15, 1997,  Manitoba Hydro and Minnesota
Power jointly announced the signing of a three-year  agreement whereby MPEX will
provide Manitoba Hydro with hourly power trading and energy scheduling  services
in the U.S. This agreement became effective Jan. 1, 1998.  Manitoba Hydro is the
fourth largest electric utility in Canada. More than a third of Manitoba Hydro's
electric sales represent exports of renewable  hydroelectricity  to the U.S. and
neighboring  provinces in Canada. MPEX is reviewing new strategic  opportunities
for  its  wholesale  marketing  operations  in  light  of the  new  Open  Access
Transmission Rules enacted by FERC in 1996. Wholesale contracts with a number of
municipal customers have been extended and modified.

In 1996 the Company completed functional unbundling of its operations under FERC
Order No. 888,  "Open Access  Transmission  Rules." This order  required  public
utilities  to take  transmission  service for their own  wholesale  transactions
under the same terms and conditions on which transmission service is provided to
third parties.  Also in 1996, the Company filed its "Code of Conduct" under FERC
Order No.  889,  "Open  Access Same Time  Information  System and  Standards  of
Conduct,"  which  formalized  the  functional   separation  of  generation  from
transmission  within the  organization.

                                                                             21|

<PAGE>

The  transmission   component  of  Electric  Operations  is  organized  for  and
conducting business under these new federal regulatory requirements.

RETAIL.  In 1995  the  MPUC  initiated  an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  of the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery of electric service will be efficient following any restructuring,  the
MPUC  adopted 15  principles  to guide a  deliberate  and  orderly  approach  to
developing reasonable  restructuring  alternatives that ensure the fairness of a
competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January  1996 the MPUC
established a competition  working group in which company  representatives  have
participated in addressing  issues related to wholesale and retail  competition.
That group  issued a Wholesale  Competition  Report in October 1996 and a Retail
Competition  Report in November 1997. The MPUC is expected to begin  identifying
the steps  that are  necessary  to  successfully  implement  restructuring  upon
receipt of a legislative mandate.

LEGISLATION.  During 1998  Congress  is expected to continue to debate  proposed
legislation  which, if enacted,  would promote retail customer choice and a more
competitive  electric  market.  The  Company is  actively  participating  in the
dialogue and debate on these issues in various  forums,  principally to advocate
fairness and parity for all power and energy competitors in deregulated  markets
that may be created by new  legislation.  While Congress is not expected to pass
legislation  in 1998,  the Company cannot predict the timing or substance of any
future legislation which might ultimately be enacted.  However, the Company will
take the necessary steps to maintain its competitive position as both a low-cost
supplier and a long-term supplier to large industrial customers.  The Company is
also promoting property tax reform before the Minnesota  legislature in order to
eliminate the taxation of personal  property that results in an inequitable  tax
burden among current and potential competitors in local markets.

Legislative  activity is evolving both in Minnesota and  Wisconsin.  An Electric
Energy Task Force comprised of  representatives  of both houses of the Minnesota
legislature  continues  to  study  a  variety  of  issues  related  to  industry
restructuring.  The Wisconsin  legislature is pursuing electric utility industry
restructuring,  including the possible formation of an independent  transmission
system operator within the state. In Minnesota  legislation has been introduced,
but the Governor and  legislative  leadership  have  indicated that no action to
restructure the industry will be taken in 1998.

CONSERVATION.  Minnesota  requires electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5%
of annual retail  electric  revenue on conservation  improvement  programs (CIP)
each year. An annually  approved  billing  adjustment  combined with retail base
rates  allows the Company to recover  both costs of  energy-saving  programs and
lost  margins  associated  with power  saved as a result of such  programs.  The
Company's  largest  conservation  programs  are  targeted at taconite  and paper
customers  to  promote  their  efficient  use  of  energy.   CIP  also  provides
demand-side  management  grants on a competitive  basis to commercial  and small
industrial  customers,  low-cost  financing for energy-saving  investments,  and
promotes energy  conservation  for residential and commercial  customers.  SWL&P
also offers  electric and gas  conservation  programs to qualified  customers as
approved by the PSCW.

ENVIRONMENTAL.  CLEAN AIR ACT. By burning low sulfur coal in units equipped with
pollution control  equipment,  the Company's power plants presently operate well
below the sulfur  dioxide  emission  limits set for the year 2000 by the federal
Clean Air Act. The Company has spent $4.2  million and will spend an  additional
$1.8 million in 1998 on advanced low emission  burner  technology and associated
control  equipment to operate at or below the compliance  standards for nitrogen
oxide  emissions  required by the Clean Air Act. The final stage of this project
is expected to be completed by mid-1998.

KYOTO  PROTOCOL.  On Dec. 11, 1997, the United Nations  Framework  Convention on
Climate Change agreed upon a draft  international  treaty,  the Kyoto  Protocol,
(Protocol)

|22


<PAGE>

which, if ratified,  would call for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The
United States' target is to achieve a 7% reduction below 1990 emission levels by
the period 2008-2012.  The Protocol must be ratified by the U.S. Senate by March
15, 1999;  however,  the treaty does not currently satisfy the guidance provided
in a 1997 Senate resolution. The Company currently cannot predict when or if the
Protocol  will be ratified  nor can it  determine  the impact such  ratification
would have on the Company.

1997 TO 1996 COMPARISON.  Operating revenue and income from Electric  Operations
were up $12.7  million  in 1997.  The  demand for  electricity  by all  customer
classes  continued to be strong in 1997,  as did the marketing of sales to other
power  suppliers.  Revenue from sales to other power  suppliers  was 4% lower in
1997 because less power was available. Less power was available for sale because
of higher  prices for  purchased  power,  reduction in  transmission  capability
damaged by severe spring storms in the Midwest,  various generating unit outages
at Company and other plants in the Midwest, and less hydro generation in Canada.
While  total  revenue  from sales to other  power  suppliers  was lower in 1997,
higher profit margins were realized on these sales.  To ensure the  preservation
of wilderness lands, in 1997 the Company sold property along the St. Louis River
to the State of Minnesota. The Company also sold rights to microwave frequencies
in accordance with a federal  mandate.  Pre-tax gains totaling $4.3 million from
these two  sales were included  in 1997  operating  revenue  and  income.  Total
operating  expenses from  Electric  Operations  increased  $4.6 million in 1997.
Purchased  power  expenses and  depreciation  expense both increased $3 million,
while the recent reform of the Minnesota  property tax system  reduced  property
taxes  by $2.8  million  in  1997.  Start-up  costs  associated  with  strategic
initiatives  and  incentive  compensation  awards  related to total  shareholder
return  performance  also  contributed  to higher  operating  expenses  in 1997.
Interest  expense was $1.2 million lower in 1997 as a result of debt  refinanced
at lower rates.

1996 TO 1995 COMPARISON.  Operating revenue and income from Electric  Operations
were $25.7 million higher in 1996 due to a 14% increase in total kWh sales.  The
increase in sales was primarily  attributed to the Company's  marketing of power
to other power suppliers.  Extreme winter weather in 1996 compared to the milder
winter in 1995 increased  sales to residential  and  commercial  customers,  and
reduced sales to taconite producers. While revenue from sales of electricity was
higher in 1996, lower margins were realized because the cooler summer weather in
1996 resulted in lower wholesale pricing. Total electric operating expenses were
$29.2 million higher in 1996.  The $13.9 million  increase in fuel and purchased
power expenses in 1996 was attributed to the 14% increase in total kWh sales. In
addition,  Square Butte, one of Minnesota  Power's low priced sources of energy,
produced 23% more energy in 1996  after being down for scheduled  maintenance in
1995.  Operations  expenses  included costs  associated  with the mid-1995 early
retirement  offering which was part of the Company's  ongoing efforts to control
costs and maintain low electric rates.  The cost of the offering was $15 million
and is being amortized over 3 years.  Expenses in 1996 included twelve months of
amortization,  while 1995  included  only five  months.  Employee  and  customer
related expenses were also higher in 1996.

OUTLOOK.  The contribution from Electric Operations is expected to remain stable
as the industry  continues to restructure.  Electric  Operations  intend to seek
additional cost saving alternatives and efficiencies,  and expand  non-regulated
services to maintain its  contribution to net income.  MP Enterprises,  a wholly
owned  subsidiary  of the  Company,  was  created  in  1996  to  facilitate  the
development of the non-regulated  services of Electric  Operations.  It provides
the required expertise  necessary to offer these services within and outside the
Company's  electric  service  territory.   The  Company's  newest  non-regulated
subsidiary,  MP Telecom,  was  established  in 1997 to provide high volume fiber
optic and microwave  communications  to businesses  across the Company's service
territory.

WATER SERVICES

Water  Services  are  comprised  of  regulated  and  non-regulated  wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.  Florida Water, the largest
investor  owned water supplier in Florida,  provides water to 119,000  customers
and  wastewater  treatment  services  to 52,000  customers  in  Florida.  Heater
provides water to 28,000  customers and wastewater  treatment  services to 2,000
customers in North  Carolina  and South  Carolina.  NON-REGULATED  SUBSIDIARIES.
Instrumentation  Services,  Inc. and U.S.  Maintenance  and  Management  provide
predictive  maintenance services to water utility companies and other industrial
operations  in several  southern  states.  Headquartered  in Chicago,  Illinois,
Americas' Water offers contract management,  operations and maintenance services
to governments and industries throughout the Americas.

Water Services  contributed  net income of $8.2 million in 1997 ($5.4 million in
1996; $(1.0) million in 1995). Financial performance for 1997 reflected improved
operating  efficiencies  at Florida Water, a full year of rate relief and a gain
from the strategic sale of certain water assets.

WATER AND WASTEWATER  RATES.  1995 RATE CASE.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1
million  rate  increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers of
Florida  Water  regulated by the FPSC. In October 1996 the FPSC issued its final
order approving an $11.1 million annual increase. In November 1996 Florida Water
filed with the Florida  First  District  Court of Appeals  (Court of Appeals) an
appeal of the final  order  seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating to the
amount of investment  in utility  facilities  recoverable  in rates from current
customers.  Other parties to the rate case also filed appeals.  In June 1997, as
part of the review process,  the FPSC allowed Florida Water to resume collecting
approximately $1 million,  on an annual basis, in new customer  connection fees.
The Company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Court of Appeals reversed a 1993 FPSC order
establishing  uniform  rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With
"uniform  rates," all  customers  in a uniform  rate area pay the same rates for
water and wastewater  services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order, in
August 1996 the FPSC ordered  Florida Water to issue refunds to those  customers
who paid more since  October 1993 under  uniform rates than they would have paid
under  stand-alone  rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge  to
customers who paid less under uniform  rates.  Florida Water  appealed,  and the
Court of  Appeals  ruled in June  1997 that the FPSC  could  not  order  refunds
without balancing  surcharges.  In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the
FPSC issued an order on Jan. 26, 1998,  that would not require  Florida Water to
refund about $12.5 million,  which included interest, to customers who paid more
under uniform rates.

Also on Jan. 26, 1998,  the FPSC ordered  Florida  Water to refund $2.5 million,
the amount paid by  customers  in the Spring Hill service area from January 1996
through June 1997 under uniform rates which exceeded the amount these  customers
would  have paid under a  modified  stand-alone  rate  structure.  No  balancing
surcharge  was  permitted.  The FPSC  ordered  this refund  because  Spring Hill
customers  continued  to pay uniform  rates after other  customers  began paying
modified stand-alone rates effective January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's interim
rate order in Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case.  The FPSC did not include  Spring
Hill in this interim rate order because Hernando County had assumed jurisdiction
over Spring Hill's rates.  In June 1997 Florida Water reached an agreement  with
Hernando County to revert to stand-alone  rates for Spring Hill  customers.  The
Company

intends to appeal the $2.5 million  refund.  No provision for refund has
been recorded.

COMPETITION.  Water Services  provide water and wastewater  utility  services at
regulated rates within exclusive service territories granted by regulators.
                           
1997 TO 1996 COMPARISON.  Operating  revenue and income from Water Services were
$10.3 million higher in 1997 because of increased  rates approved by the FPSC in
1996 for  Florida  Water  customers  and a $7.3  million  pre-tax  gain from the
strategic  sale of water and  wastewater  assets to Orange  County,  Florida, in
December 1997. These assets served about 4,000 customers.  Also in 1997,  Heater
acquired LaGrange, a water utility near Fayetteville,  North Carolina,  for $3.4
million.  The  acquisition  added 5,300 water  customers  and  contributed  $0.9
million in  revenue.  The  increase  in revenue  was  partially  offset by lower
revenue  following  the sale of two water  systems  in South  Carolina  in 1996.
Together  the two  strategic  sales  resulted in pre-tax  gains of $1.7  million
during 1996.  Sales were up 3% in 1997,  despite  heavy  rainfall and  continued
water  conservation  efforts  by  customers.  Non-regulated  water  subsidiaries
contributed $1.2 million more to revenue in 1997. Total operating  expenses from
Water  Services were $5.7 million higher in 1997 primarily due to start-up costs
associated with the Company's non-regulated water subsidiaries. Approximately $2
million of  one-time  charges  relating to the amount of  investment  in utility
facilities  were also  included  in  operating  expenses in 1997.  These  higher
operating expenses were tempered by improved  operating  efficiencies at Florida
Water.  Interest  expense  decreased  $1.5 million in 1997 due to lower interest
rates on refinanced debt.

1996 TO 1995 COMPARISON.  Operating  revenue and income from Water Services were
$19.1 million higher in 1996. Rate relief and a 9% increase in sales in 1996 are
primarily  responsible for the increase. A 2% growth in customers and the return
of more typical weather in Florida both contributed to higher sales in 1996. The
increase  in sales was  tempered by  continued  customer  conservation  efforts.
Florida Water added 17,000 new water and wastewater customers as a result of the
December 1995 purchase of the assets of Orange Osceola Utilities in Florida.  As
part of a strategic  decision to withdraw from South  Carolina,  Heater sold the
majority  of its assets in that  state and  recognized  $1.7  million in pre-tax
gains during 1996.  Non-regulated water subsidiaries contributed $5.3 million to
revenue in 1996. Total operating  expenses from Water Services were $8.7 million
higher in 1996 primarily due to the acquisition of Orange Osceola Utilities. The
addition of non-regulated operations also increased operating expenses in 1996.

OUTLOOK.  Florida Water and Heater  continue to position  themselves for further
expansion by  selectively  acquiring and selling  targeted water systems.  The
strategic  emphasis  at Heater is growth and  consolidation  in North  Carolina.
Water  Services has been laying the  groundwork for future growth in several new
areas of the water business. Non-regulated subsidiaries have initiated marketing
the Company's water expertise outside traditional utility boundaries.



AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

Automotive Services include wholly owned subsidiaries:  ADESA, a vehicle auction
business; AFC, a finance company; and Great Rigs, an auto transport company.

ADESA is the third largest vehicle auction business in the U.S. Headquartered in
Indianapolis,  Indiana,  ADESA owns and operates 25 vehicle auctions in the U.S.
and Canada  through which used cars and other vehicles are purchased and sold by
franchised automobile dealers and licensed used car dealers.  Sellers at ADESA's
auctions  include  domestic  and  foreign  auto   manufacturers,   car  dealers,
automotive   fleet/lease  companies,   banks  and  finance  companies.   ADESA's
Professional  Auto Remarketing (PAR) division  provides  customized  remarketing
services to various businesses with fleet operations.

AFC provides inventory financing for wholesale and retail automobile dealers who
purchase  vehicles from 

                                                                             25|

<PAGE>

ADESA auctions,  independent auctions and other auction chains. Headquartered in
Indianapolis,  Indiana,  AFC has 57 loan production offices.  From these offices
car dealers  obtain credit to purchase  vehicles at any of the over 300 auctions
approved by AFC.

Great Rigs,  headquartered  in Moody,  Alabama,  is one of the nation's  largest
independent used automobile transport companies. It offers customers pick up and
delivery service through 11 strategically located transportation hubs. Customers
of Great Rigs include ADESA auctions,  car dealerships,  vehicle  manufacturers,
leasing companies, finance companies and other auctions.

The Company acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995. On Jan. 31, 1996, the Company
provided additional capital in exchange for 3% of ADESA. On Aug. 21, 1996,  the 
Company  acquired the remaining  17% ownership interest of ADESA from the ADESA 
management shareholders.

Automotive  Services  contributed  net  income of $14.0  million  in 1997  ($3.7
million  in 1996;  $0.0  million  for the six  months  of  ownership  in  1995).
Financial  performance for 1997 reflected  increased vehicle sales and services,
improved  operating  efficiencies  at ADESA auctions and growth of the financing
business.

COMPETITION.   Within  the  automobile  auction  industry,  ADESA's  competition
includes  independently  owned auctions as well as major chains and associations
with auctions in geographic proximity.  ADESA competes with other auctions for a
supply  of  automobiles  to be  sold  on  consignment  for  automobile  dealers,
financial  institutions  and other sellers.  ADESA also competes for a supply of
rental repurchase vehicles from automobile  manufacturers for auction at factory
sales.  The  automobile  manufacturers  often  choose  between  auctions  across
multi-state areas in distributing rental repurchase vehicles. ADESA competes for
these sellers of  automobiles by attempting to attract a large number of dealers
to purchase vehicles,  which ensures  competitive prices and supports the volume
of vehicles auctioned. ADESA also competes by providing a full range of services
including   reconditioning   services   which  prepare   vehicles  for  auction,
transporting  vehicles and the prompt processing of sale  transactions.  In 1997
ADESA  agreed with  another  U.S.  auction  company to jointly sell Toyota Motor
Credit  Corporation  (TMCC) vehicles  through a common Internet  "Cyberlot." The
Cyberlot  provides  descriptions  and  photos of  vehicles  along with the price
established by TMCC. This gives dealers the opportunity to buy vehicles  through
the Internet.  Another factor affecting the industry, the impact of which is yet
to be  determined,  is the  entrance  of the large used car  dealerships  called
"superstores" that have emerged in densely populated markets.

AFC is well positioned as a provider of floorplan financing services to the used
vehicle industry. AFC's competition includes other specialty lenders, as well as
banks and other  financial  institutions.  AFC  competes  with  other  floorplan
providers and strives to distinguish  itself based upon  convenience and quality
of service.  A key  component  of AFC's  program is  conveniently  located  loan
production  offices with personnel  available to assist automobile  dealers with
their financing  needs. As part of AFC's continued  effort to focus on providing
other financing services to dealers,  in 1997 AFC entered into an agreement with
ACC Consumer  Finance Corp.  (ACC).  Together  these two  companies  will test a
program designed to promote ACC's purchase of installment contracts that finance
the purchase of vehicles floorplanned by AFC.
                           
1997 TO 1996 COMPARISON.  Operating revenue and income from Automotive  Services
were $71.6 million higher in 1997  primarily due to increased  vehicle sales and
ancillary services, such as reconditioning and transportation, at ADESA auction
facilities.  ADESA sold  769,000  vehicles in 1997  (637,000  in 1996).  

|26

<PAGE>

Auction  facilities  added in 1996  contributed to higher vehicle sales in 1997.
Operating  revenue  from  AFC in 1997  reflected  the  growth  of the  floorplan
financing business through expansion of existing loan production offices and the
addition of 25 new office locations.  The increase in AFC's dealer/customer base
to 10,000 (4,000 in 1996) enabled AFC to finance  300,000  vehicles  (140,000 in
1996). Pre-tax gains  totaling $5.7 million from the sale of an auction facility
and excess land were also included in 1997 operating  revenue and income.  Total
operating  expenses at Automotive  Services  were $50.9 million  higher in 1997.
Operating  expenses  associated  with the auction  facilities  reflected the 21%
increase in vehicles  sold and increased  ancillary  services.  These  operating
expenses  were  tempered by improved  efficiencies  and cost controls at auction
facilities. The expansion of AFC's floorplan financing business and a more 
conservative allowance for bad debts also contributed to higher operating  
expenses in 1997.

1996 TO 1995 COMPARISON.  Financial results for Automotive  Services reflected a
full year of operations in 1996, while 1995 only included  operations as of July
1,  1995,  the  purchase  date of  ADESA.  Operating  revenue  and  income  from
Automotive  Services  were higher in 1996 because  ADESA added eight new auction
facilities  during the year.  ADESA sold  637,000  vehicles in 1996  compared to
230,000  vehicles during the last six months of 1995 (470,000  vehicles in total
were sold by ADESA in 1995).  Increased  ancillary services and the expansion of
AFC also  contributed to revenue  growth in 1996.  Total  operating  expenses at
Automotive  Services  were higher in 1996 due to the  addition of eight  auction
facilities  which  caused  ADESA  to incur  additional  financing  expenses  and
significant  start-up  costs.   Start-up  losses  associated  with  two  auction
facilities had a negative impact on profitability of Automotive Services through
1996.

For the six months ended Dec. 31, 1995, operating revenue was $61.6 million with
no net income contribution. Financial results in 1995 were adversely impacted by
auction  cancellations  due to severe  weather  conditions  on the east coast in
December 1995, as well as start-up  losses  associated  with major  construction
projects.

OUTLOOK.  Auto auction  sales for the industry are expected to rise at a rate of
6% to 8% annually. With the increased popularity of leasing and the high cost of
new vehicles,  the same vehicles may come to auction more than once.  Automotive
Services  expects to  participate in the  industry's  growth  through  selective
acquisitions and expanded services. ADESA and AFC continue to focus on growth in
the volume of vehicles  sold and financed,  increased  ancillary  services,  and
operating and technological efficiencies.  The expansion of the Great Rigs fleet
of automobile carriers to 150 by the end of second quarter 1998 is also expected
to contribute to future growth.

INVESTMENTS

Investments  include  a  securities  portfolio,  a 21%  equity  investment  in a
financial guaranty  reinsurance and insurance company,  and an 80% interest in a
Florida real estate company.

Investments  contributed  net income of $32.1 million in 1997 ($38.1  million in
1996;  $41.3  million  in 1995).  Financial  performance  for 1997  reflected  a
consistent  return on the  securities  portfolio,  an increase in earnings  from
Capital Re and an increase in real  estate  sales.  Net income was lower in 1997
because  tax  benefits  were  recognized  in 1996  and  1995  from  real  estate
operations.

PORTFOLIO  AND  REINSURANCE.  The Company's  securities  portfolio is managed by
selected outside managers as well as internal managers. The securities portfolio
is intended to provide stable  earnings and liquidity, and is available for
investment in existing  businesses,  acquisitions and other corporate  purposes.
The majority of the portfolio consists of stocks of other utility companies that
have investment  grade debt securities.  Additionally,  the Company sells common
stock securities short and enters into short sales of treasury futures contracts
as part  of an  overall  investment  portfolio  hedge  strategy.

                                                                             27|

The  Company's  investment  in the  securities  portfolio at Dec. 31, 1997,  was
approximately $184 million ($155 million at Dec. 31, 1996).

Capital Re is a Delaware  holding  company  engaged in reinsurance and insurance
through its wholly owned  subsidiaries.  The market value of the Company's  $119
million equity  investment in Capital Re was $203 million at Dec. 31, 1997 ($152
million at Dec. 31, 1996).

1997 TO 1996  COMPARISON.  Operating  revenue  and  income  from the  securities
portfolio  were  $1.4  million  higher in 1997  because  the  Company's  average
portfolio balance was larger. Income tax expense was $5.7 million higher in 1997
because of increased  operating income.  In addition,  1996 reflected a one-time
tax benefit for an IRS audit adjustment. Together, the Company's securities
portfolio and its equity investment in Capital Re earned an annualized after-tax
return of 8.6% in 1997 (8.8% in 1996).  Income from equity investments  included
$14.8  million  in 1997  ($11.8  million in 1996) of income  from the  Company's
investment in Capital Re.

1996 TO 1995  COMPARISON.  Operating  revenue  and  income  from the  securities
portfolio  were $3.5 million  lower in 1996 due to a smaller  average  portfolio
balance.  In 1995 the Company sold  approximately  $60 million of  securities to
finance the  purchase  of ADESA.  Income tax  expense  reflected a one-time  tax
benefit for an IRS audit adjustment in 1996. Together,  the Company's securities
portfolio and its equity investment in Capital Re earned an annualized after-tax
return of 8.8% in 1996 (9.2% in 1995).  Income from equity investments  included
$11.8  million  of income in 1996  ($9.8  million  in 1995)  from the  Company's
investment in Capital Re.

OUTLOOK.  The Company's  objective is to maintain corporate liquidity between 7%
and 10% of total assets ($150 to $200 million). The Company plans to continue to
concentrate in market-neutral  investment  strategies designed to provide stable
and acceptable returns without  sacrificing  needed liquidity.  The portfolio is
hedged against market  downturns and aimed at an after-tax return between 7% and
9%. While these returns may seem modest  compared to broader market indices over
the past three years,  the Company  believes its hedge strategy is a wise course
in a volatile economic  environment.  Actual returns will be partially dependent
on general  market  conditions.  Capital Re will continue to be a core component
of the Company's Investments segment.

REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS. The Company owns 80% of Lehigh, a real estate company in
Florida. Lehigh owns 2,500 acres of land and approximately 4,000 home sites near
Fort Myers, Florida, 1,000 home sites in Citrus County,  Florida, and 2,700 home
sites and 12,000 acres of  residential,  commercial and industrial  land at Palm
Coast, Florida.

TAX  BENEFITS.  The  Company,  through  Lehigh,  acquired  the  stock of  Lehigh
Corporation  in a bargain  purchase in 1991. The  carried-over  tax bases of the
underlying assets exceeded the book bases assigned in purchase  accounting.  The
Internal  Revenue  Code (IRC)  limits the use of tax losses  resulting  from the
higher tax basis.

SFAS 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes," was adopted on a  prospective  basis
effective Jan. 1, 1993. Upon adoption,  a valuation  reserve was established for
the entire amount of the tax benefits  attributable to the bases differences and
alternative minimum tax credits because, in management's  judgment,  realization
of the tax benefits  was not "more likely than not." This  judgment was based on
the unlikelihood of realizing the tax benefits due to the IRC  restrictions  in
light of management's existing five year property disposal plan.

In 1995 based on a detailed analysis of projected cash flow, Lehigh  implemented
a business  strategy  which called for Lehigh to dispose of its  remaining  real
estate assets with a specific  

|28


<PAGE>

view towards maximizing  realization of the tax benefits.  Accordingly,  in 1995
the valuation  reserve was reduced by $18.4 million.  In 1996 the remaining $8.2
million  valuation  reserve was reversed as a result of the  projected  positive
impact the 1996 Palm Coast acquisition would have on Lehigh's taxable income.

1997 TO 1996 COMPARISON.  Financial results for real estate operations reflected
twelve months of Palm Coast operations in 1997 compared to less than nine months
in 1996.  Operating  revenue and income from real  estate  operations  were $9.6
million  higher  in 1997  primarily  due to  increased  sales  from  Palm  Coast
operations.  In 1996 operating revenue and income included $3.7 million from the
sale of Lehigh's  joint venture  investment  in a resort and golf course.  Total
operating  expenses  (excluding  minority  interest) from real estate operations
were $5.7 million  higher in 1997.  The increase  was  attributed  to more sales
activity and additional  expenses as a result of Palm Coast  operations.  Income
tax expense in 1996 included the  recognition of $8.2 million of tax benefits at
Lehigh. The Company's portion of the tax benefits was $6.6 million in 1996.

1996  TO  1995  COMPARISON.  Operating  revenue  and  income  from  real  estate
operations  were $9.7 million  higher in 1996 due  primarily  to increased  real
estate  sales from the Palm Coast  operations  and $3.7 million from the sale of
Lehigh's  joint  venture in a resort and golf course.  In 1996 Lehigh  purchased
properties  at  Palm  Coast,   Florida,   and  expanded  its  marketing  program
nationwide.  Total operating  expenses  (excluding  minority interest) from real
estate  operations  were $1.7 million lower in 1996. The decrease was attributed
to exiting several auxiliary businesses and cost containment efforts. Income tax
expense  included the recognition of $8.2 million of tax benefits in 1996 ($18.4
million in 1995). The Company's  portion of the tax benefits was $6.6 million in
1996 ($14.7 million in 1995).

OUTLOOK.  The real estate  strategy is to continue to acquire large  residential
community  properties at low cost,  add value  and sell them at current  market
prices.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flow  from  operations  improved  significantly  during  1997 due to better
management of working  capital  throughout  the Company and capital  expenditure
discipline.  Cash flow after funding  capital  expenditures  was $117 million in
1997 ($35 million in 1996).  Automotive Services  experienced a major turnaround
in cash flow generating $23 million in 1997 ($(34) million in 1996).

Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally  is  provided  by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and  approximately 4 million  original issue shares of common stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.  Minnesota Power's $60 million bank
lines of credit provide  liquidity for the Company's  commercial  paper program.
The amount and timing of future sales of the  Company's  securities  will depend
upon market  conditions and the specific  needs of the Company.  The Company may
from time to time sell securities to meet capital  requirements,  to provide for
the  retirement or early  redemption  of issues of long-term  debt and preferred
stock, to reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.

A substantial  amount of ADESA's  working  capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA uses commercial paper issued
by the Company to meet short-term working capital  requirements arising from the
timing of payment  obligations to vehicle sellers and the  availability of funds
from vehicle purchasers. During the sales process, ADESA does not typically take
title to vehicles.

AFC also uses  commercial  paper  issued by the Company to meet its  operational
requirements.  AFC offers  short-term  on-site financing for dealers to purchase
vehicles at auctions in exchange for a security interest in those vehicles.  The
financing  is  provided  through  the  earlier of the date the dealer  sells the
vehicle  or a  general  borrowing  term of  30-60  days.  As a  result  of AFC's
continued  expansion of the  financing  program for  dealers,  AFC has 

                                                                             29|


<PAGE>

sold $124 million of receivables to a third party purchaser as of Dec. 31, 1997
($50  million as of Dec.  31,  1996).  Under the terms of a five-year  agreement
amended in August 1997, the purchaser agrees to purchase receivables aggregating
$225 million, at any one time outstanding, to the extent that such purchases are
supported by eligible  receivables.  Proceeds  from the sale of the  receivables
were  used to repay  borrowings  from the  Company  and fund  vehicle  inventory
purchases for AFC's customers.

During 1997 the Company sold $60 million of First Mortgage  Bonds, 7% Series due
Feb. 15, 2007,  and $20 million of First Mortgage  Bonds,  6.68% Series due Nov.
15, 2007.  The proceeds were used for the retirement of $60 million in principal
amount of the Company's  First Mortgage  Bonds, 7 3/8% Series due March 1, 1997,
and $18 million in principal amount First Mortgage Bonds, 6 1/2% Series redeemed
in December. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

In June 1997 Minnesota  Power  refinanced $10 million of industrial  development
revenue  bonds and $29 million of  pollution  control  bonds with $39 million of
Variable  Rate Demand  Revenue  Refunding  Bonds  Series 1997A due June 1, 2020,
Series  1997B and Series  1997C due June 1, 2013,  and Series  1997D due Dec. 1,
2007.

In May 1997 MP Water  Resources' $30 million  10.44%  long-term note payable was
replaced with $28 million of Florida Water's First Mortgage Bonds,  8.01% Series
due May 30, 2017,  and $7 million of Heater's First  Mortgage  Bonds,  7.05% due
June 20, 2022. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

Minnesota  Power's electric  utility first mortgage bonds and secured  pollution
control  bonds are currently  rated  investment  grade Baa1 by Moody's  Investor
Services  and A by  Standard  and Poor's.  The  Company's  investment  rating is
currently Baa1 by Moody's Investor Services and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's. The
disclosure of these securities  ratings is not a recommendation  to buy, sell or
hold the Company's securities.

In 1997 the  Company  paid out 83% (89% in 1996;  94% in 1995) of its  per-share
earnings in dividends. Over the longer term, Minnesota Power's goal is to reduce
dividend payout to 75%-80% of earnings.

CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS.  Consolidated capital expenditures totaled $72 million in
1997 ($101 million in 1996; $115 million in 1995). Expenditures in 1997 included
$35 million for Electric Operations, $22 million for Water Services, $11 million
for  Automotive  Services  and $4 million  for  corporate  purposes.  Internally
generated funds were the primary source for funding capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures are expected to be $90 million in 1998 and total about $301
million for 1999 through 2002. The 1998 amount includes $45 million for electric
system  component  replacement and upgrades,  telecommunication  fiber, and coal
handling equipment,  $24 million to meet environmental  standards,  expand water
and wastewater  treatment  facilities to accommodate  customer  growth,  and for
water  conservation  initiatives  and $21 million for on-going  improvements  at
existing vehicle auction facilities and associated computer systems. The Company
expects to use internally  generated funds and original issue equity  securities
to fund these capital expenditures.

YEAR 2000.  The Year 2000 issue relates to computer  systems that  recognize the
year  using  the  last  two  digits.  Unless  corrected,  the  year  2000 may be
interpreted as 1900 causing errors or shutdowns in computer  systems.  In recent
years the Company has replaced its major  systems with systems  considered to be
Year 2000 compliant.  A project team is  coordinating a comprehensive  

|30


<PAGE>

review of all the Company's  remaining software systems and micro-based  systems
for Year 2000 compliance.  The review process includes key outside entities with
which the Company interacts. The Company anticipates having all systems reviewed
and an estimate of the Company's cost to meet Year 2000  compliance by mid-1998.
A significant  proportion of these costs are not likely to be incremental  costs
to  the  Company,  but  rather  will  represent  the  redeployment  of  existing
information technology resources.

The Year 2000 issue may impact other  entities with which the Company  transacts
business.   The  Company  cannot  estimate  or  predict  the  potential  adverse
consequences,  if any, that could result from such entities'  failure to address
this issue.

SAFEHARBOR  STATEMENT.  In  connection  with the safe harbor  provisions  of the
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), the Company is
hereby filing  cautionary  statements  identifying  important factors that could
cause the Company's actual results to differ  materially from those projected in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on behalf of the Company in this Annual Report, in presentations, in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates",   "estimates",   "expects",   "intends",   "plans",   "predicts",
"projects",  "will likely result", "will continue", and similar expressions) are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties and
are  qualified in their  entirety by reference to, and are  accompanied  by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:
(i) prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those of
the FERC, the MPUC,  the FPSC,  the NCUC, and the PSCW,  with respect to allowed
rates of return, industry and rate structure, acquisition and disposal of assets
and facilities,  operation,  and construction of plant  facilities,  recovery of
purchased  power,  and present or prospective  wholesale and retail  competition
(including  but not limited to retail  wheeling and  transmission  costs);  (ii)
economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic risks;  (iii)
changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;  (iv)
weather conditions;  (v) population growth rates and demographic patterns;  (vi)
competition for retail and wholesale customers; (vii) pricing and transportation
of commodities;  (viii) market demand, including structural market changes; (ix)
changes  in tax rates or  policies  or in rates of  inflation;  (x)  changes  in
project  costs;  (xi)  unanticipated  changes in operating  expenses and capital
expenditures; (xii) capital market conditions; (xiii) competition for new energy
development  opportunities;  and  (xiv)  legal  and  administrative  proceedings
(whether  civil or criminal)  and  settlements  that  influence the business and
profitability of the Company.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement
is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  such
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on
the business or the extent to which any factor,  or combination of factors,  may
cause results to differ  materially from those contained in any  forward-looking
statement.

                                                                             31|

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of Minnesota Power

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet and the related
consolidated  statements  of  income,  of  retained  earnings  and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Minnesota
Power and its  subsidiaries  at December  31, 1997 and 1996,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December 31, 1997,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

MANAGEMENT

The  consolidated  financial  statements and other  financial  information  were
prepared  by  management,   which  is  responsible   for  their   integrity  and
objectivity.  The financial  statements  have been  prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles and necessarily  include some amounts
that are based on informed  judgments  and best  estimates  and  assumptions  of
management.

To meet its responsibilities with respect to financial  information,  management
maintains  and  enforces a system of internal  accounting  controls  designed to
provide assurance,  on a cost effective basis, that transactions are carried out
in accordance with management's  authorizations  and that assets are safeguarded
against  loss from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The system  includes  an
organizational   structure   which  provides  an   appropriate   segregation  of
responsibilities,  careful selection and training of personnel, written policies
and  procedures,  and periodic  reviews by the  internal  audit  department.  In
addition,  the Company has a personnel  policy which  requires all  employees to
maintain a high standard of ethical conduct.  Management  believes the system is
effective and provides  reasonable  assurance that all transactions are properly
recorded and have been executed in accordance with  management's  authorization.
Management  modifies and improves its system of internal  accounting controls in
response to changes in business  conditions.  The Company's internal audit staff
is charged  with the  responsibility  for  determining  compliance  with Company
procedures.

Four  directors of the Company,  not members of  management,  serve as the Audit
Committee.  The  Board of  Directors,  through  its  Audit  Committee,  oversees
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets
regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants
to discuss  auditing and  financial  matters and to assure that each is carrying
out its responsibilities.  The internal auditors and the independent accountants
have full and free access to the Audit Committee without management present.

Price Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants, are engaged to express an opinion
on the  financial  statements.  Their  audit is  conducted  in  accordance  with
generally accepted auditing standards and includes a review of internal controls
and tests of transactions to the extent necessary to allow them to report on the
fairness of the operating results and financial condition of the Company.

OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FINANCIAL  STATEMENT   PREPARATION.   Minnesota  Power  prepares  its  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
principles  require management to make informed judgments and best estimates and
assumptions that (1) affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  (2)
disclose  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of  the  financial
statements,  and (3) report amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period.  Actual  results could differ from those  estimates.  Abbreviations  and
acronyms are defined on page 50.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its majority owned subsidiary companies.  All
material   intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.

NATURE  OF   OPERATIONS   AND  REVENUE   RECOGNITION.   Minnesota   Power  is  a
broadly diversified  service  company  that  has  operations  in  four principal
business  segments.  Corporate  charges  consist  of  expenses  incurred  by the
Company's  corporate  headquarters  and interest and preferred stock expense not
specifically  identifiable to a business segment.  Management's policy is to not
allocate these expenses to business segments.

ELECTRIC  OPERATIONS.  Electric Operations  generate,  transmit,  distribute and
market  electricity.  Electric  service  is  provided  to 136,000  customers  in
northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin.  Large power customers, which
include  five  taconite  producers,  four paper and pulp mills and two  pipeline
companies, purchase under contracts, which extend from October 1999 through July
2008,  about half of the electricity the Company sells. BNI Coal, a wholly owned
subsidiary,  mines  and  sells  lignite  coal  to two  North  Dakota  mine-mouth
generating units, one of which is Square Butte.  Square Butte supplies Minnesota
Power with 71% of its output under a long-term contract. (See Note 5.)

Electric  rates  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  various  state  and  federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued for service provided but not billed.  Electric rates include  adjustment
clauses which bill or credit customers for fuel and purchased energy costs above
or below the base levels in rate  schedules  and bill retail  customers  for the
recovery of CIP expenditures not collected in base rates.

During 1997 revenue  derived from one major  customer was $56.5  million  ($57.1
million in 1996;  $60.4  million in 1995).  Revenue  derived from another  major
customer  was $42.7  million in 1997 ($41.2  million in 1996;  $44.9  million in
1995).

WATER SERVICES.  Water Services include several wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company.  Florida  Water is the  largest  investor  owned  supplier of water and
wastewater  utility  services in Florida.  Heater  provides water and wastewater
services  primarily  in North  Carolina.  In total,  147,000  water  and  54,000
wastewater  treatment customers are served. Water and wastewater rates are under
the jurisdiction of various state and county regulatory  authorities.  Bills are
rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is accrued for  services  provided  but not
billed.  Instrumentation  Services,  Inc. and U.S.  Maintenance  and  Management
provide  predictive  maintenance  services to water utility  companies and other
industrial  operations  in  several  southern  states.  Americas'  Water  offers
contract  management,  operations and  maintenance  services  to governments and
industries throughout the Americas.

AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES.  Automotive  Services  include wholly owned  subsidiaries:
ADESA, a vehicle auction  business;  AFC, a finance company;  and Great Rigs, an
auto transport  company.  ADESA is the third largest vehicle auction business in
the U.S.  ADESA owns and  operates 25 vehicle  auctions  in the U.S.  and Canada
through which used cars and other  vehicles are purchased and sold by franchised
automobile  dealers and licensed used car dealers.  Sellers at ADESA's  auctions
include  domestic  and  foreign  auto  manufacturers,  car  dealers,  automotive
fleet/lease  companies,  banks and finance  companies.  AFC  provides  inventory
financing for wholesale and retail automobile dealers who purchase vehicles from
ADESA auctions,  independent  auctions and other auction chains. AFC has 57 loan
production  offices.  From these  offices car dealers  obtain credit to purchase
vehicles at any of the over 300 auctions  approved by AFC.  Great Rigs is one of
the nation's largest independent used automobile transport companies.  It offers
customers
                                                                             37|

pick  up  and  delivery  service  through  11  strategically  located
transportation hubs. Revenue is recognized when services are performed.

INVESTMENTS.  The Company's  securities  portfolio is intended to provide stable
earnings  and  liquidity,   and  is available  for  reinvestment  in  existing
businesses,  acquisitions  and other corporate  purposes.  The Company has a 21%
ownership in Capital Re, a financial guaranty  reinsurance  and  insurance
company,  accounted  for using the equity method.  The Company also has an 80%
ownership in Lehigh,  a Florida real estate business. Real estate revenue is
recognized on the accrual basis.

PLANT  DEPRECIATION.  Plant is recorded at original cost, and is reported on the
balance sheet net of accumulated  depreciation.  Expenditures  for additions and
significant  replacements  and  improvements  are  capitalized;  maintenance and
repair  costs are  expensed  as  incurred.  When  utility  plant is  retired  or
otherwise  disposed  of,  the cost less net  proceeds  is  normally  charged  to
accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. Contributions in aid
of  construction  relate to water utility  assets,  and are  amortized  over the
estimated life of the associated asset. This amortization  reduces  depreciation
expense.

Depreciation is computed using the estimated useful lives of the various classes
of  plant.  In 1997  average  depreciation  rates  for the  electric,  water and
automotive segments were 3.4%, 2.7% and 4.1%, respectively (3.2%, 2.6% and 3.5%,
respectively in 1996; 3.1%, 2.9% and 4.7%, respectively in 1995).

FUEL,  MATERIAL AND SUPPLIES.  Fuel, material and supplies are stated at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.

GOODWILL.  Goodwill  represents the excess of cost over net assets of businesses
acquired and is amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over a 40 year period.

DEFERRED  REGULATORY  CHARGES AND CREDITS.  The Company's utility operations are
subject to the  provisions  of SFAS 71,  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation."  The Company  capitalizes as deferred  regulatory  charges
incurred costs which are probable of recovery in future utility rates.  Deferred
regulatory  credits  represent  amounts  expected to be credited to customers in
rates. (See Note 4.)

UNAMORTIZED EXPENSE, DISCOUNT AND PREMIUM ON DEBT. Expense, discount and premium
on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  The Company considers all investments purchased with
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  Results of operations for Automotive  Services'
Canadian  subsidiaries  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars  using  the  average
exchange rates during the period.  Assets and  liabilities  are translated  into
U.S.  dollars  using the  exchange  rate on the balance  sheet date,  except for
intangibles and fixed assets, which are translated at historical rates.

wastewater assets to Orange County in Florida for $13.1 million.  The facilities
served  about  4,000  customers.  The  transaction  resulted  in a $4.7  million
after-tax gain which is included in the Company's 1997 earnings.

In March 1996 Heater of Seabrook,  Inc., a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of Heater,
sold all of its  water and  wastewater  utility  assets to the Town of  Seabrook
Island,   South  Carolina  for  $5.9  million.   This  sale  was  negotiated  in
anticipation of an eminent domain action by the Town of Seabrook  Island,  South
Carolina.  In December 1996 Heater sold its Columbia,  South Carolina area water
systems to South  Carolina  Water and Sewer,  L.L.C.  The  Seabrook and Columbia
systems served a total of 6,500  customers.  The  transactions  resulted in a $1
million after-tax gain which was included in the Company's 1996 earnings.

ACQUISITION  OF  LAGRANGE.  In 1997 the NCUC  approved  the transfer of LaGrange
Waterworks  Corporation,  a water utility near Fayetteville,  North Carolina, to
Heater. The Company exchanged 96,000 shares of common stock, with a market value
of  approximately  $3.4  million,  for the  outstanding  shares of LaGrange  and
accounted for the transaction as a pooling of interest.  The  acquisition  added
5,300 water  customers.  Financial  results  prior to the  acquisition  were not
restated due to immateriality.

ACQUISITION  OF PALM COAST.  In April 1996 Palm Coast  Holdings,  Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Lehigh Acquisition Corporation,  acquired real estate assets
(Palm Coast) from ITT Community  Development  Corp. and other  affiliates of ITT
Industries,  Inc.  (ITT)  for  $34  million.  These  assets  included  developed
residential lots, a real estate contract receivables portfolio and approximately
13,000 acres of  commercial  and other land.  Palm Coast is a planned  community
located between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, Florida.

ITT's  wholly owned  subsidiary,  Palm Coast  Utility  Corporation  (PCUC),  has
granted an option to the Company to acquire PCUC's water and wastewater  utility
assets in Palm Coast. PCUC provides  services to approximately  12,000 customers
in Flagler  County,  Florida.  The option  expires during 1998. If the option is
exercised,  closing of the  transaction  will be  subject to various  regulatory
approvals.

ACQUISITION  OF  ISI.  In  April  1996  MP  Water  Resources  acquired  all  the
outstanding  common  stock  of  Instrumentation  Services,  Inc.,  a  predictive
maintenance  service business,  in exchange for 96,526 shares of Minnesota Power
common  stock.  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for as a pooling of  interest.
Financial   results  prior  to  the   acquisition   were  not  restated  due  to
immateriality.

ACQUISITION  OF ORANGE  OSCEOLA.  In December  1995 Florida  Water  acquired the
operating assets of Orange Osceola Utilities for approximately $13 million.  The
acquisition added over 17,000 water customers.

ACQUISITION  OF  ADESA.  The  Company  acquired  80% of ADESA  on July 1,  1995,
increased  its  ownership  interest  to 83% in  January  1996 and  acquired  the
remaining  17%  interest  in  August  1996.  The total  purchase  price was $227
million.  The step  acquisitions  were  accounted  for by the  purchase  method.
Accordingly,  ADESA  earnings have been  included in the Company's  consolidated
financial  statements  based on the  ownership  interest  as of the date of each
acquisition.  Acquired  goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized
using the straight line method.  Pro forma  disclosures  for the acquisition are
not presented as the impact on consolidated  1996 and 1995 operating  results is
immaterial.

In September 1996 Minnesota Power  exchanged  473,006 shares of its common stock
for all the outstanding common stock of Alamo Auto Auction,  Inc. and Alamo Auto
Auction  Houston,  Inc.  These  acquisitions  were  accounted  for as pooling of
interests.  Financial results prior to the acquisitions were not restated due to
immateriality.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its interest in
the paper and pulp business to Consolidated  Papers, Inc. (CPI) for $118 million
in cash,  plus CPI's  assumption  of  certain  debt and lease  obligations.  The
financial  results  of the  paper  and  pulp  business,  including  the  loss on
disposition, were accounted for as discontinued operations.

REGULATORY MATTERS

The  Company  files  for  periodic  rate  revisions  with the  Minnesota  Public
Utilities  Commission (MPUC),  the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC),
the  Florida  Public  Service  Commission  (FPSC)  and other  state  and  county
regulatory authorities. The MPUC had regulatory authority over approximately 68%
in 1997 (69% in 1996;  73% in 1995) of the Company's  total  electric  operating
revenue.  Interim rates in Minnesota and Florida are placed into effect, subject
to refund with interest, pending a final decision by the appropriate commission.

WATER AND WASTEWATER  RATES.  1995 RATE CASE.  Florida Water  requested an $18.1
million  rate  increase in June 1995 for all water and  wastewater  customers of
Florida  Water  regulated by the FPSC. In October 1996 the FPSC issued its final
order approving an $11.1 million annual increase. In November 1996 Florida Water
filed with the Florida  First  District  Court of Appeals  (Court of Appeals) an
appeal of the final  order  seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating to the
amount of investment  in utility  facilities  recoverable  in rates from current
customers.  Other parties to the rate case also filed appeals.  In June 1997, as
part of the review process,  the FPSC allowed Florida Water to resume collecting
approximately $1 million,  on an annual basis, in new customer  connection fees.
The Company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the appeals process.

1991 RATE CASE REFUNDS.  In 1995 the Court of Appeals reversed a 1993 FPSC order
establishing  uniform  rates for most of Florida  Water's  service  areas.  With
"uniform  rates," all  customers  in a uniform  rate area pay the same rates for
water and wastewater  services.  In response to the Court of Appeals'  order, in
August 1996 the FPSC ordered  Florida Water to issue refunds to those  customers
who paid more since  October 1993 under  uniform rates than they would have paid
under  stand-alone  rates.  This order did not permit a balancing  surcharge  to
customers who paid less under uniform  rates.  Florida Water  appealed,  and the
Court of  Appeals  ruled in June  1997 that the FPSC  could  not  order  refunds
without balancing  surcharges.  In response to the Court of Appeals' ruling, the
FPSC issued an order on Jan. 26, 1998,  that would not require  Florida Water to
refund about $12.5 million,  which included interest, to customers who paid more
under uniform rates.

Also on Jan. 26, 1998,  the FPSC ordered  Florida  Water to refund $2.5 million,
the amount paid by  customers  in the Spring Hill service area from January 1996
through June 1997 under uniform rates which exceeded the amount these  customers
would  have paid under a  modified  stand-alone  rate  structure.  No  balancing
surcharge  was  permitted.  The FPSC  ordered  this refund  because  Spring Hill
customers  continued  to pay uniform  rates after other  customers  began paying
modified stand-alone rates effective January 1996 pursuant to the FPSC's interim
rate order in Florida  Water's 1995 Rate Case.  The FPSC did not include  Spring
Hill in this interim rate order because Hernando County had assumed jurisdiction
over Spring Hill's rates.  In June 1997 Florida Water reached an agreement  with
Hernando County to revert to stand-alone  rates for Spring Hill  customers.  The
Company intends to appeal the $2.5 million  refund.  No provision for refund has
been recorded.

DEFERRED  REGULATORY CHARGES AND CREDITS.  Based on current rate treatment,  the
Company believes all deferred regulatory charges are probable of recovery.

SQUARE BUTTE PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT

Under the terms of a 30-year  contract  with Square Butte that  extends  through
2007,   the  Company  is  purchasing  71%  of  the  output  from  a  mine-mouth,
lignite-fired  generating  plant  capable  of  generating  up to  455  MW.  This
generating  unit (Project) is located near Center,  North Dakota.  Reductions to
about 49% of the output are provided  for in the contract  and, at the option of
Square Butte,  could begin after a five-year  advance  notice to the Company and
continue for the  remaining  economic  life of the Project.  The Company has the
option but not the  obligation  to continue to purchase  49% of the output after
2007.

The Project is leased to Square Butte  through Dec. 31, 2007,  by certain  banks
and their  affiliates  which have  beneficial  ownership in the Project.  Square
Butte has  options  to renew the lease  after  2007 for  essentially  the entire
remaining economic life of the Project.

The  Company is  obligated  to pay  Square  Butte all  Square  Butte's  leasing,
operating  and debt service costs (less any amounts  collected  from the sale of
power or energy to others)  that  shall not have been paid by Square  Butte when
due.  These costs  include the price of lignite  coal  purchased by Square Butte
under a cost-plus contract with BNI Coal. The Company's cost of power and energy
purchased  from Square Butte  during 1997 was $56.9  million  ($58.2  million in
1996;  $57.6 million in 1995). The leasing costs of Square Butte included in the
cost of power  delivered  to the Company  totaled  $17.1  million in 1997 ($17.7
million in 1996; $19.3 million in 1995), which included approximately $9 million
($10.2  million in 1996;  $11 million in 1995) of interest  expense.  The annual
fixed lease  obligations  of the Company for Square Butte are $17.2 million from
1998 through 2002. At Dec. 31, 1997,  Square Butte had total debt outstanding of
$250 million. The Company's obligation is absolute and unconditional  whether or
not any power is actually delivered to the Company.

The  Company's  payments  to Square  Butte for power and energy are  approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.

One principal  reason the Company  entered into the agreement  with Square Butte
was to obtain a power supply for large  industrial  customers.  Present electric
service contracts with these customers require payment of minimum monthly demand
charges that cover a portion of the fixed costs  associated with having capacity
available  to serve  them.  These  contracts  minimize  the  negative  impact on
earnings that could result from significant  reductions in kilowatthour sales to
industrial  customers.  The initial  minimum  contract  term for the large power
customers  is 10  years,  with a  four-year  cancellation  notice  required  for
termination  of the  contract at or beyond the end of the tenth year.  Under the
terms of existing  contracts  as of Feb.  1, 1998,  the  Company  would  collect
approximately $92.1 million under current rate levels for firm power during 1998
($78.3 million in 1999;  $69.2 million in 2000; $66.5 million in 2001; and $47.3
million in 2002),  even if no power or energy were  supplied to these  customers
after Dec. 31, 1997. The minimum contract  provisions are expressed in megawatts
of demand,  and if rates change, the amounts the Company would collect under the
contracts will change in proportion to the change in the demand rate.

JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITY

The Company owns 80% of Boswell Energy Center Unit 4 (Boswell Unit 4). While the
Company operates the plant,  certain decisions with respect to the operations of
Boswell Unit 4 are subject to the  oversight of a committee on which the Company
and Wisconsin  Public Power,  Inc. SYSTEM (WPPI),  the owner of the other 20% of
Boswell Unit 4, have equal  representation  and voting  rights.  Each owner must
provide  its own  financing  and is  obligated  to pay its  ownership  share  of
operating  costs.  The Company's share of direct  operating  expenses of Boswell
Unit 4 is included in operating expense on the consolidated statement of income.
The Company's 80% share of the original cost included in electric  plant at Dec.
31, 1997 was $305 million  ($304 million at Dec. 31,  1996).  The  corresponding
provision for accumulated depreciation was $136 million ($129 million at Dec.
31, 1996).

                                                                             41|

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SECURITIES INVESTMENTS.  Securities investments,  managed internally and also by
external  fund  managers,  consist  primarily  of  equity  securities  of  other
utilities with investment  grade debt ratings.  Investments held principally for
near-term  sale are  classified  as trading  securities  and included in current
assets at fair  value.  Changes  in the fair  value of  trading  securities  are
recognized  currently in earnings.  Investments held for an indefinite period of
time are classified as  available-for-sale  securities and included in plant and
investments  at fair value.  Unrealized  gains and losses on  available-for-sale
securities are included in common stock equity, net of tax. Unrealized losses on
available-for-sale  securities  that are other than  temporary are recognized in
earnings.  Realized  gains and losses are computed on each  specific  investment
sold.

reflecting the Company's share of Capital Re's net unrealized holding gains. The
net unrealized holding gains included in earnings for trading securities in 1997
were $2 million ($0.9 million in 1996; $1.5 million in 1995).

FAIR VALUE OF  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS.  With the  exception  of the items listed
below,  the estimated fair values of all financial  instruments  approximate the
carrying amount. The fair values for the items below were based on quoted market
prices for the same or similar instruments.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. Financial  instruments that subject the Company to
concentrations  of credit risk  consist  primarily of accounts  receivable.  The
Company  sells  electricity  to  about  15  customers  in  northern  Minnesota's
taconite,  pipeline,  paper and wood  products  industries.  At Dec.  31,  1997,
receivables from these customers totaled approximately $9 million ($8 million in
1996).  The Company does not obtain  collateral to support utility  receivables,
but  monitors  the credit  standing  of major  customers.  The  Company  has not
incurred and does not expect to incur significant credit losses.

SALE OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES.  In 1997 AFC amended an agreement to allow sales up
to $225 million,  previously  $100 million,  of finance  receivables  to a third
party.  Pursuant to this agreement, AFC has sold $124 million of receivables as
of Dec. 31, 1997 ($50 million as of Dec. 31, 1996). The agreement expires at
the end of 2001.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  AND RISKS.  In  portfolio  strategies
designed to reduce market risks, the Company sells common stock securities short
and enters into short sales of treasury futures contracts.  Selling common stock
securities  short is  intended to reduce  market  price  risks  associated  with
holding common stock securities in the Company's trading  securities  portfolio.
Realized  and  unrealized  gains and  losses  from short  sales of common  stock
securities  are included in investment  income.  Treasury  futures are used as a
hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks  associated  with holding  fixed  dividend
preferred stocks included in the Company's available-for-sale portfolio. Changes
in market  values of treasury  futures are  recognized  as an  adjustment to the
carrying  amount of the  underlying  hedged  item.  Gains and losses on treasury
futures are deferred and recognized in investment income concurrently with gains
and losses arising from the under-

|42

<PAGE>

lying hedged item.  Generally,  treasury futures  contracts  entered into have a
maturity date of 90 days.

In 1997  Florida  Water  restructured  an interest  rate swap  agreement to take
advantage of more favorable terms.  Under the new five-year  agreement,  Florida
Water will make  quarterly  payments at a variable rate based upon an average of
various foreign LIBOR rates (3.7% at Dec. 31, 1997),  and receive payments based
on a fixed  rate of 4.8%.  This  agreement  is  subject  to  market  risk due to
interest rate fluctuation.

The notional amounts summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged and are
not a measure of the Company's  financial  exposure.  The amounts  exchanged are
calculated on the basis of these  notional  amounts and other terms which relate
to the change in interest rates or securities  prices.  The Company  continually
evaluates the credit standing of counterparties and market conditions,  and does
not expect any material  adverse  impact to its  financial  position  from these
financial instruments.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND COMPENSATING BALANCES

The Company has bank lines of credit,  which make short-term financing available
through  short-term bank loans and provide support for commercial paper. At Dec.
31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had bank lines of credit aggregating $84 million.
At the end of 1997 and 1996,  $84 million  was  available  for use. At Dec.  31,
1997, the Company had issued  commercial paper with a face value of $130 million
($155 million in 1996), with liquidity  provided by bank lines of credit and the
Company's securities portfolio.

Certain  lines of  credit  require  a  commitment  fee of 1/10 of 1% and/or a 5%
compensating  balance.  Interest rates on commercial  paper and borrowings under
the lines of credit  ranged from 6.1% to 8.5% at Dec.  31, 1997 (5.6% to 8.3% at
Dec. 31, 1996). The weighted  average interest rate on short-term  borrowings at
Dec.  31,  1997,  was  6.3%  (5.7%  at Dec.  31,  1996).  The  total  amount  of
compensating balances at Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996, was immaterial.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN. On July 24, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company
adopted a rights  plan  (Rights  Plan)  pursuant to which it declared a dividend
distribution of one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each  outstanding
share of common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on July
24,  1996,  (the  Record  Date) and  authorized  the  issuance of one Right with
respect  to each share of common  stock that  becomes  outstanding  between  the
Record Date and July 23, 2006, or such earlier time as the Rights are redeemed.

Each Right will be  exercisable  to  purchase  one  one-hundredth  of a share of
Junior Serial Preferred Stock A, without par value, at an exercise price of $90,
subject to adjustment,  following a distribution date which shall be the earlier
to occur of (i) 10 days following a public  announcement  that a person or group
(Acquiring  Person) has acquired,  or obtained the right to acquire,  beneficial
ownership  of 15% or more of the  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock  (Stock
Acquisition  Date)  or (ii) 15  business  days  (or  such  later  date as may be
determined by the Board of Directors  prior to the time that any person  becomes
an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or a public  announcement of
an intention to make, a tender or exchange offer if, upon consummation  thereof,
such person would meet the 15% threshold.

Subject to certain exempt  transactions,  in the event that the 15% threshold is
met,  each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring  Person) will  thereafter
have the right to receive,  upon exercise at the then current  exercise price of
the Right, common stock (or, in certain  circumstances,  cash, property or other
securities of the Company)  having a value equal to two times the exercise price
of the Right. If, at any time following the Stock  Acquisition Date, the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more
of the Company's  assets or earning power are sold,  each Right will entitle the
holder (other than the Acquiring  Person) to receive,  upon exercise at the then
current exercise price of the Right,  common stock of the acquiring or surviving
company  having a value  equal to two times  the  exercise  price of the  Right.
Certain stock acquisitions will also trigger a provision permitting the Board of
Directors to exchange each Right for one share of common stock.

The Rights are  nonvoting  and expire on July 23, 2006,  unless  redeemed by the
Company  at a price  of $.01 per  Right  at any time  prior to the time a person
becomes  an  Acquiring  Person.  The  Board  of  Directors  has  authorized  the
reservation  of one  million  shares  of  Junior  Serial  Preferred  Stock A for
issuance under the Rights Plan in the event of exercise of the Rights.

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY

MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned business trust of the
Company  for the  purpose of  issuing  common and  preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  In March  1996 the  Trust  publicly  issued  three  million  8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial  interests in the assets held by the Trust.  The proceeds of the sale
of the QUIPS, and of common securities of the Trust to the Company, were used by
the  Trust  to  purchase   from  the  Company  $77.5  million  of  8.05%  Junior
Subordinated Debentures, Series A, Due 2015 (Subordinated Debentures), resulting
in net  proceeds  to the  Company  of $72.3  million.  Holders  of the QUIPS are
entitled to receive  quarterly  distributions  at an annual rate of 8.05% of the
liquidation  preference value of $25 per security.  The Company has the right to
defer interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures which would result in the
similar deferral of distributions on the QUIPS during extension periods up to 20
consecutive  quarters.  The  Company  is the  owner  of  all  the  common  trust
securities,  which  constitute  approximately  3% of the  aggregate  liquidation
amount of all the Trust Securities.  The sole asset of the Trust is Subordinated
Debentures,  interest  on which is  deductible  by the  Company  for  income tax
purposes.  The Trust will use  interest  payments  received on the  Subordinated
Debentures it holds to make the quarterly cash distributions on the QUIPS.

The QUIPS are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated
Debentures at maturity or upon redemption.  The Company has the option to redeem
the  Subordinated  Debentures  upon the occurrence of certain events and, in any
event, may do so at any time on or after March 20, 2001.

The Company has  guaranteed,  on a  subordinated  basis,  payment of the Trust's
obligations.

TAX  BENEFITS.  The  Company,  through  Lehigh,  acquired  the  stock of  Lehigh
Corporation  in a bargain  purchase in 1991. The  carried-over  tax bases of the
underlying assets exceeded the book bases assigned in purchase  accounting.  The
Internal  Revenue  Code (IRC)  limits the use of tax losses  resulting  from the
higher tax basis.

SFAS 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes," was adopted on a  prospective  basis
effective Jan. 1, 1993. Upon adoption,  a valuation  reserve was established for
the entire amount of the tax benefits  attributable to the bases differences and
alternative minimum tax credits because, in management's

|46

<PAGE>

judgment,  realization  of the tax benefits was not "more likely than not." This
judgment was based on the  unlikelihood of realizing the tax benefits due to the
IRC restrictions  in light of management's existing five year property disposal
plan.

In 1995 based on a detailed analysis of projected cash flow, Lehigh  implemented
a business  strategy  which called for Lehigh to dispose of its  remaining  real
estate assets with a specific  view towards  maximizing  realization  of the tax
benefits.  Accordingly,  in 1995 the  valuation  reserve  was  reduced  by $18.4
million.  In 1996 the remaining $8.2 million valuation reserve was reversed as a
result of the projected  positive impact the 1996 Palm Coast  acquisition  would
have on Lehigh's taxable income.

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. No provision has been made for taxes on $19.1 million of
pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re, an investment accounted for under
the equity  method.  Those earnings have been and are expected to continue to be
reinvested.  The Company  estimates that $7.9 million of tax would be payable on
the pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re if the Company should sell its
investment.  The Company has recognized  the income tax impact on  undistributed
earnings of Capital Re earned since Jan. 1, 1993.

Undistributed  earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries were approximately
$6.6  million  at Dec.  31,  1997  ($4.2  million  at Dec.  31,  1996).  Foreign
undistributed  earnings  are  considered  to be  indefinitely  reinvested,  and,
accordingly,  no  provision  for U.S.  federal and state  income  taxes has been
provided  thereon.  Upon distribution of foreign  undistributed  earnings in the
form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income
tax (subject to an adjustment,  for foreign tax credits) and  withholding  taxes
payable to Canada.  Determination  of the amount of  unrecognized  deferred U.S.
income tax liability is not practical due to the  complexities  associated  with
its  hypothetical  calculations;   however,   unrecognized  foreign  tax  credit
carryforwards  would be available to reduce some portion of the U.S.  liability.
Withholding taxes of approximately $0.3 million would be payable upon remittance
of all previously unremitted earnings at Dec. 31, 1997 ($0.2 million at Dec. 31,
1996).

EMPLOYEE STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN. The Company  sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership
Plan (ESOP) with two leveraged accounts.

A 1989  leveraged  ESOP  account  covers all  eligible  nonunion  Minnesota  and
Wisconsin  utility and  corporate  employees.  The ESOP used the proceeds from a
$16.5  million  loan (15 year term at 9.125%),  guaranteed  by the  Company,  to
purchase 600,000 shares of Company common stock on the open market. These shares
fund an annual benefit of not less than 2% of participants' salaries.

A 1990  leveraged  ESOP  account  covers  Minnesota  and  Wisconsin  utility and
corporate  employees who  participated in the  non-leveraged  ESOP plan prior to
August 1989. In 1990  the ESOP issued a $75 million note (term not to exceed 25
years at 10.25%) to the Company as consideration for 2.8 million shares of newly
issued  common stock.  These shares are used to fund an annual  benefit at least
equal to the value of (a)  dividends on shares held in the 1990  leveraged  ESOP
which  are  used to make  loan  payments,  and (b) tax  benefits  obtained  from
deducting eligible dividends.

The loans will be repaid with  dividends  received by the ESOP and with employer
contributions.  ESOP shares  acquired with the loans were  initially  pledged as
collateral  for the loans.  The ESOP shares are  released  from  collateral  and
allocated to participants based on the portion of total debt service paid in the
year.  The ESOP  shares  that  collateralize  the loans are not  included in the
number of average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share.

EMPLOYEE  STOCK  PURCHASE  PLAN. The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
that permits eligible  employees to buy up to $23,750 per year of Company common
stock at 95% of the market  price.  At Dec.  31, 1997,  476,000  shares had been
issued  under the plan,  and  168,000  shares  were held in  reserve  for future
issuance.

STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS. The Company has an Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
Compensation  Plan and a Director  Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, both of which
became  effective in January 1996. The Executive Plan allows for the grant of up
to 2.1 million shares of common stock to key employees of the Company.  To date,
these grants have taken the form of stock options,  performance share awards and
restricted stock awards. The Director Plan allows for the grant of up to 150,000
shares of common stock to nonemployee directors of the Company. Each nonemployee
director  receives an annual grant of 725 stock options and a biennial  grant of
performance  shares  equal to  $10,000  in value of common  stock at the date of
grant.

Stock options are  exercisable  at the market price of common shares on the date
the options are granted,  and vest in equal annual  installments  over two years
with expiration ten years from the date of grant.  Performance shares are earned
over  multi-year  time periods and are contingent upon the attainment of certain
performance goals of the Company. Restricted stock vests once certain periods of
time have elapsed.

The Company has elected to account  for its  stock-based  compensation  plans in
accordance  with APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees,"
and accordingly,  compensation expense has not been recognized for stock options
granted.  Compensation  expense  is  recognized  over the  vesting  periods  for
performance  and  restricted  share  awards  based  on the  market  value of the
Company's stock, and was  approximately $4 million in 1997 ($1 million in 1996).
Pro forma net income and earnings per share under SFAS No. 123  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation"  have not been presented because such amounts are not
materially   different   from  actual   amounts   reported.   This  may  not  be
representative  of the pro forma effects for future years if  additional  awards
are granted.

In 1997 the Company  granted  approximately  244,000 stock  options  (127,000 in
1996),  26,000  performance  share awards (74,000 in 1996),  and 9,000 shares of
restricted stock (24,000 in 1996). The average fair value of options granted was
$6.54  ($6.76  in 1996).  The  average  remaining  contractual  life of  options
outstanding at the end of 1997 was 8.7 years (9 years in 1996).  In January 1998
the Company  granted stock options to purchase  approximately  185,000 shares of
common stock and granted approximately 87,000 performance share awards.

PENSION PLANS AND BENEFITS

The  Company's  Minnesota and Wisconsin  utility and corporate  operations  have
noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension plans  covering  eligible  employees.
Pension benefits are based on an employee's  years of service and earnings.  The
Company  makes   contributions   to  the  plans   consistent  with  the  funding
requirements of employee benefit and tax law. Plan assets are invested primarily
in  publicly  traded  equity and fixed  income  securities.  At Dec.  31,  1997,
approximately 8% of plan assets were invested in Company common stock.  Benefits
under the Company's  noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension plan for Florida
utility operations were frozen as of Dec. 31, 1996.

contribution  pension plans covering  eligible  employees.  The aggregate annual
pension  cost for these  plans was $2.1  million  ($0.9  million  in 1996 and in
1995).

POSTRETIREMENT  BENEFITS.  The  Company  provides  certain  health care and life
insurance   benefits  for  retired   employees.   Company   policy  is  to  fund
postretirement  benefit costs,  through Voluntary  Employee Benefit  Association
(VEBA)  trusts and an  irrevocable  grantor  trust  (IGT),  as the  amounts  are
collected in rates. Maximum tax deductible  contributions are made to the VEBA
trusts, with  remaining  funds  placed in the IGT until  such  time as they
become  tax deductible. Funds in the IGT do not qualify as plan assets and are
excluded from assets in the table below. Plan assets are invested primarily in
publicly traded equity  and  fixed  income   securities.  The  regulatory  asset
for deferred postretirement benefits is being  amortized in electric  rates over
a five year period which began in 1995.

The assumed health care cost trend rate used was 9.4%,  gradually  decreasing to

trend  rate  would  result  in  a  $4.6  million  increase  in  the  accumulated
postretirement  benefit  obligations (APBO) and a $0.8 million increase in total
service and interest costs.
