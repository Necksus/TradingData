Item 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSINESS</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Hershey Foods Corporation
and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) are engaged in the
manufacture, distribution and sale of confectionery and grocery products. The
Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24,
1927, as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In June 2002, the
Corporation completed the sale of a group of the Corporation&#146;s
non-chocolate confectionery candy brands to Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers Candy
Company, Inc. for $12.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment
initiatives. Included in the transaction were the <I>HEIDE</I>,
<I>JUJYFRUITS</I>, <I>WUNDERBEANS</I> and <I>AMAZIN&#146; FRUIT</I> trademarked
confectionery brands as well as the rights to sell <I>CHUCKLES</I> branded
products, under license. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
principal product groups include: confectionery products sold in the form of bar
goods, bagged items and boxed items; and grocery products in the form of baking
ingredients, chocolate drink mixes, peanut butter, dessert toppings and
beverages. The Corporation believes it is a leader in many of these product
groups in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Operating profit margins vary
considerably among individual products and brands. Generally, such margins on
confectionery products are greater than those on grocery products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation
manufactures confectionery products in a variety of packaged forms and markets
them under more than 50 brands. The different packaged forms include various
arrangements of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as
a variety of different sizes and weights of the same bar products, such as snack
size, standard, king size, large and giant bars. Among the principal
confectionery products in the United States are: <I>HERSHEY&#146;S COOKIES

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation also
manufactures and/or markets grocery products in the baking, beverage, peanut
butter and toppings categories. Principal products in the United States include
<I>HERSHEY&#146;S, REESE&#146;S</I> and<I> HEATH</I> baking pieces,
<I>HERSHEY&#146;S </I>chocolate milk mix, <I>HERSHEY&#146;S </I>cocoa,

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation has license
agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell products worldwide.
Among the more significant are agreements with affiliated companies of Cadbury
Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or market and distribute <I>YORK,</I>
<I>PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY </I>and <I>PETER PAUL MOUNDS </I>confectionery products

for <I>CADBURY </I>and <I>CARAMELLO </I>products is subject to a minimum sales
requirement that the Corporation exceeded in 2002. The Corporation also has an
agreement with Societe des Produits Nestle SA, which licenses the</FONT></P>

<hr size=2 noshade>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Corporation  to  manufacture   and   distribute   <I>KIT  KAT  </I>and   <I>ROLO
</I>confectionery  products in the United States. The Corporation&#146;s  rights
under   this   agreement   are   extendible   on  a   long-term   basis  at  the
Corporation&#146;s option, subject to certain conditions, including minimum unit
volume sales.  In 2002,  the minimum  volume  requirements  were  exceeded.  The
Corporation   has  an  agreement   with  an  affiliate  of   Huhtam&#228;ki   Oy
(&#147;Huhtamaki&#148;)  pursuant  to  which  it  licenses  the  use of  certain
trademarks,  including <I>GOOD &amp; PLENTY,  HEATH,  JOLLY RANCHER,  MILK DUDS,
PAYDAY  </I>and  <I>WHOPPERS</I>  for  confectionery  products  worldwide.   The
Corporation&#146;s  rights under this  agreement  are  extendible on a long-term
basis at the Corporation&#146;s option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain grocery stores, candy
distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies,
wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food distributors by
full-time sales representatives, food brokers and part-time retail sales
merchandisers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation
believes its products are sold in over 2 million retail outlets in North
America. In 2002, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to
approximately 21 percent of the Corporation&#146;s total net sales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation
manufactures, imports, markets, sells and distributes chocolate products in
Brazil under the HERSHEY&#146;S brand name. Additional products in Brazil
include <I>IO-IO</I> hazelnut cr&#232;me items and chocolate and confectionery
products sold under the <I>VISCONTI</I> brand name. In China, Japan, Korea and
the Philippines, the Corporation imports and/or markets selected confectionery
and grocery products. The Corporation also markets confectionery and grocery
products in over 90 countries worldwide. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior quality of its
products, mass distribution and the best possible consumer value in terms of
price and weight. In addition, the Corporation devotes considerable resources to
the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new
products. The Corporation utilizes a variety of promotional programs for
customers and advertising and promotional programs for consumers. The
Corporation employs promotional programs at various times during the year to
stimulate sales of certain products. Confectionery and grocery seasonal and
holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth
quarters of the year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation recognizes
that the mass distribution of its confectionery and grocery  products is an important element
in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers. The
Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning
optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement
of efficiencies in distribution. To achieve these objectives, the Corporation
has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants, distribution
centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the United States,
Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a combination of public and contract
carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers.
In conjunction with sales and marketing efforts, the distribution system has
been instrumental in the effective promotion of new, as well as established,
products on both national and regional scales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>From time to time, the
Corporation has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate
changes in manufacturing costs, the competitive environment and profit
objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. The Corporation
implemented an increase in the wholesale price of its domestic standard size,
king size, variety pack, 6-pack and 10-pack lines effective January 1, 2003. The
standard size increase was approximately 11 percent. The effect of all the
increases translates into an approximate 3 percent increase over the entire
domestic product line. The last standard candy bar price increase was
implemented by the Corporation in December 1995. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The most significant raw
material used in the production of the Corporation&#146;s chocolate products is
cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally from Far Eastern, West
African and South American equatorial regions. West Africa accounts for
approximately 70 percent of the world&#146;s crop. Cocoa beans are not uniform,
and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices
and natural conditions found in the many growing areas. The Corporation buys a
mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The table below sets forth
 annual  average  cocoa prices as well as the highest
and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices
are the monthly  average of the  quotations at noon of the three active  futures
trading contracts closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of
the Corporation&#146;s forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium
prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans, these average futures contract
prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporation&#146;s  average cost of
cocoa beans or cocoa products.</FONT></P>

Source:   International Cocoa Organization Quarterly Bulletin of Cocoa Statistics</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Cocoa market prices rose sharply
during 2002 and this increase accelerated following a rebellion in the
world&#146;s largest cocoa producing country, the Ivory Coast. Continued civil
unrest in the Ivory Coast could result in further cocoa price increases. The
Corporation&#146;s costs during 2003 and beyond will not necessarily reflect
market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices, premiums
and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times, and supply
and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. The
Corporation&#146;s costs for cocoa will increase substantially in 2004; however,
the Corporation expects to achieve its long-term goals for growth and
profitability by a combination of possible price increases and/or product weight
changes, improved sales mix, supply chain cost reductions and strict control of
other costs to offset potential cost increases and respond to changes in the
competitive environment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Farm Security and Rural
Investment Act of 2002, which is a six-year farm bill, impacts the prices of
sugar, corn, peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these
commodities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The price of sugar, the
Corporation&#146;s second most important commodity for its domestic chocolate
and confectionery products, is subject to price supports under the above
referenced farm legislation. Due to import quotas and duties imposed to support
the price of sugar established by that legislation, sugar prices paid by United
States users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar
market. The average wholesale list price of refined sugar, F.O.B. Northeast, has
remained in a range of 25 &#162; to 32 &#162; per pound for the past ten years.
U.S. peanut prices declined approximately 25 percent during the fourth quarter
of 2002 due to a decrease in price support levels. Almond prices remained near
normal levels throughout 2002. Milk prices decreased in 2002 as a result of
increasing milk production. The Corporation believes that the supply of raw
materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation attempts to
minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its
major raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future
manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With
regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy
products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts. At
the present time, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing
the Corporation&#146;s other major raw material requirements. Futures contracts
are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener,
natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage
of market fluctuations which provide more favorable pricing opportunities and
flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements. Fuel oil
futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the
Corporation&#146;s transportation costs. The Corporation&#146;s commodity
procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases,
but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price
decreases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The primary effect on
liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements
for futures contracts related to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas,
fuel oil and certain dairy products. Cash outflows and inflows result from
original margins which are &#147;good faith deposits&#148; established by
futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual
financial obligations. Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are
required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price
movements. The magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon
price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets. Cash flows related to
margin requirements were significant during 2002 as a result of unusual
volatility in market prices, but historically, have not been material to the
Corporation&#146;s total working capital requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation manages the
purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring
procurement strategies for each of its major commodities. These procurement
strategies, including the use of futures contracts to hedge the pricing of
cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, transportation costs and certain
dairy products, are directly linked to the overall planning and management of
the Corporation&#146;s business, since the cost of raw materials, energy and
transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales. Procurement
strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material
requirements, energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the
analysis of fundamentals, including weather and crop analysis, other imbalances
between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in
producing countries and speculative influences, and by discussions with market
analysts, </FONT></P>

<p align=center>3</p>
<hr size=2 noshade>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>brokers and dealers. Procurement strategies are determined,
implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management. Procurement
activities for all major commodities are also reported to the Board of Directors
on a regular basis.</FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Competition</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Many of the
Corporation&#146;s brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the
leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in highly
competitive markets and compete with many other multinational, national,
regional and local firms, some of which have resources in excess of those
available to the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Trademarks</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation owns
various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks, and has rights
under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to the
Corporation&#146;s business. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Backlog of
Orders</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation
manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods
inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such
backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales, nor are the changes
from time to time significant, aside from the third quarter of 1999 when a
significant backlog of orders resulted from customer service and order
fulfillment problems encountered during the start-up of new business systems and
processes. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Research and
Development</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation engages in
a variety of research activities. These principally involve development of new
products, improvement in the quality of existing products, improvement and
modernization of production processes, and the development and implementation of
new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed
product lines. Information concerning the Corporation&#146;s research and
development expense is contained in Note 1 of the Corporation&#146;s Annual
Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement, which
information is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Regulation</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and Drug Administration
and various other governmental agencies, and its products must comply with
regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and with various
comparable state statutes regulating the manufacturing and marketing of food
products. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Environmental
Considerations</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In the past the Corporation
has made investments based on compliance with environmental laws and
regulations. Such expenditures have not been material with respect to the
Corporation&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Employees</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As of December 31, 2002,
the Corporation had approximately 13,700 full-time and 1,700 part-time
employees, of whom approximately 5,600 were covered by collective bargaining
agreements. A reduction of approximately 500 full-time employees occurred during
2002 as a result of a voluntary work force reduction program. A collective
bargaining agreement covering approximately 3,000 employees at two of the
Corporation&#146;s principal plants in Hershey, Pennsylvania expired in November
2001. On February 27, 2002, the employees voted not to ratify a new contract
offer, despite recommendations by their union negotiating committee and
executive board to approve the new contract. On April 17, 2002, the employees
voted again not to ratify an amended contract offer following the rejection of
that offer by the union negotiating committee. The Corporation and union
representatives continued negotiations with the assistance of a federal
mediator, but no settlement was reached and the employees went on strike
beginning April 26, 2002. The strike ended on June 6, 2002, when the employees
voted to ratify a new contract, with employees returning to work beginning on
June 8, 2002. The work stoppage did not have a material impact on the
Corporation&#146;s results of operations for 2002. The Corporation considers its
employee relations to be good. </FONT></P>

implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The IRS disallowed the interest expense
deductions associated with the underlying life insurance policies. The total
deficiency of $61.2 million, including interest, was paid to the IRS in
September 2000 to eliminate further accruing of interest. Effective October 1,
2001, the Corporation negotiated a settlement with the IRS regarding the Notice.
The resulting Closing Agreement with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense
deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted in the surrender of all
insurance  </FONT></P>

100,336 shares remaining available for future issuance under the Directors&#146;
Compensation Plan. The Directors&#146; Compensation Plan is designed to attract
and retain qualified non-employee directors and to align the interests of
non-employee directors with those of the stockholders by paying a portion of
their compensation in units representing shares of Common Stock. Directors who
are employees of the Corporation receive no remuneration for their services as
directors. RSUs are granted quarterly to each director on the first day of
January, April, July, and October on the basis of the number of shares of Common
Stock, valued at the average closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of the
Common Stock on the last three trading days preceding the grant, equal to
$10,000. While the value of the annual RSU grant is targeted at $40,000, the
actual value of the grant may be higher or lower depending upon the performance
of the Common Stock following the grant dates. A director&#146;s RSUs will vest
and be distributed upon his or her retirement from the Board. Directors may
elect to receive all or a portion of their retainer in cash or Common Stock,
although committee chair fees are paid only in cash. A director may defer
receipt of the retainer and committee chair fees until his or her retirement
from the Board. </TD>

Hershey Foods Corporation:</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Under date of January 29, 2003,
we reported on the consolidated balance sheet of Hershey Foods Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows and stockholders&#146; equity for the year then ended, which
are included in Hershey Foods Corporation&#146;s Proxy Statement for its 2003
Annual Meeting of Stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. In
connection with our audit of the aforementioned consolidated financial
statements, we also audited the schedule listed on page 18 in Item 15(a)(2).
This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the
Corporation&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
this financial statement schedule based on our audit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In our opinion, such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>To Hershey Foods Corporation:

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We have audited, in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
consolidated financial statements included in Hershey Foods Corporation&#146;s
Proxy Statement for its 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders incorporated by
reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January
22, 2002. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed on page 15 in Item
14(a)(2) is the responsibility of the Corporation&#146;s management and is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole. </FONT></P>

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                          DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION PLAN

                  (Amended and Restated as of December 3, 2002)


                                        1

                                     PURPOSE

       The purposes of the Directors' Compensation Plan ("Plan") are to provide
Directors of Hershey Foods Corporation ("Corporation") with payment alternatives
for the retainer and fees payable for services as members of the Board of
Directors ("Board") of the Corporation or as a chair of any committee thereof
(together, "Director Fees"), to provide Directors the opportunity to elect to
receive all or a portion of the retainer in Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs"), each
representing an obligation of the Corporation to issue one share of Common Stock
of the Corporation, $1.00 par value per share ("Common Stock"), and to promote
the identification of interests between such Directors and the stockholders of
the Corporation by paying a portion of each Director's compensation in
Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), each RSU representing an obligation of the
Corporation to issue one share of Common Stock.


                                        2

                                   ELIGIBILITY

       Any Director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Except
as the context may otherwise require, references in this Plan to a "Director"
shall mean only those directors of the Company who are participants in the Plan.


                                        3

                                     PAYMENT

       (a) DIRECTOR FEES. A Director shall be entitled to Director Fees, in such
amounts as shall be determined by the Board, for services on the Board and as a
chair of any committee of the Board. Directors may elect to have all or any
portion of the cash retainer paid in shares of Common Stock. Fees payable for
services as a chair of any committee of the Board shall be payable currently
only in cash. Any shares of Common Stock payable under this Section 3(a) shall
be paid by the issuance to the Director of a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the cash amount of the retainer so payable divided by the Fair Market
Value of one share of the Common Stock, as defined in Section 12 hereof. Any
fractional share of Common Stock resulting from such payment shall be rounded to
the nearest whole share. The Corporation shall issue share certificates to the
Director for the shares of Common Stock acquired or, if requested


<PAGE>

in writing by the Director and permitted  under such plan,  the shares  acquired
shall be added to the  Director's  account  under  the  Corporation's  Automatic
Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan.  As of the date on which  the part or whole of the
retainer  is  payable  in  shares  of  Common  Stock,  the  Director  shall be a
stockholder of the  Corporation  with respect to such shares.  Unless  otherwise
elected in Section 4, any remaining Director Fees shall be payable in cash.

       (b) RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. A Director shall also be entitled to receive
RSUs, in such amounts as shall be determined by the Board, for services on the
Board. Beginning October 1, 2001 and thereafter, unless otherwise directed by
the Board, RSUs having a value of $10,000 (or such other amount as the Board
shall from time to time determine) shall be awarded to each Director on the
first day of October, January, April, and July. The number of full and
fractional RSUs so awarded shall be determined by dividing $10,000 (or such
other amount) by the average of the per share closing price of the Common Stock
on the New York Stock Exchange as published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (or such
other reliable publication as the Board or its delegates may determine) for the
last three trading days of the month preceding the date of the award. Directors
whose membership on the Board commences after October 1, 2001 on a day which is
not the first day of any January, April, July or October, shall be awarded a pro
rata number of RSU's with respect to the quarter during which the Director
joined the Board equal to the number of RSUs awarded to each Director who was a
member of the Board on the first day of the applicable quarter, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of days remaining in the
quarter after the first day on which such Director became a member of the Board,
and the denominator being the total number of days in the quarter. A Restricted
Stock Unit Account shall be established on the books of the Corporation in the
name of each Director. During the period of the Director's membership on the
Board, the Director's Restricted Stock Unit Account shall be subject to credits,
adjustment and substitution to reflect any dividend or other distribution on the
outstanding Common Stock or any split or consolidation or other change affecting
the Common Stock. Any such credit, adjustment or substitution shall be made in a
manner similar to that set forth in Section 6(a) and 6(b) with respect to
Deferred Stock Compensation Accounts. RSUs awarded pursuant to the Plan shall
vest upon termination of the Director's membership on the Board by reason of
retirement, death or disability, or such other circumstances as the Board, in
its sole discretion, shall at any time determine (provided that a termination of
a Director's membership on the Board following a Change in Control (as defined
in the Corporation's Executive Benefits Protection Plan (Group 3A), the "EBPP")
shall be considered a retirement for this purpose). RSUs not vested upon or in
connection with the Director's termination of membership on the Board, as
aforesaid, shall be forfeited as of the date of such termination. The balance of
the Director's Restricted Stock Unit Account which becomes vested shall be paid
in a lump sum in accordance with Section 7. If payment hereunder would result in
the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall
not be issued and cash in lieu of such fractional share shall be paid to the
Director based upon the average of the per share closing price of the Common
Stock in the New York Stock Exchange as published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (or
such other reliable publication as the Board or its delegates may determine) for
the three trading days immediately preceding the date of payment. The
Corporation shall issue share certificates to the Director, or the Director's
designated beneficiary, for the shares of Common Stock represented by the
Director's vested RSUs, or if requested in writing by the Director and permitted
under such plan, the shares to be distributed shall be added to the Director's
account under the Corporation's Automatic Dividend


                                       2

Reinvestment  Plan.  As of the date on which the Director is entitled to receive
payment of shares of Common  Stock,  a Director  shall be a  stockholder  of the
Corporation with respect to such shares.


                                        4

                                    ELECTIONS

       (a)     DIRECTOR FEE PAYMENT ALTERNATIVES.  A Director may elect any one
 of the following  alternatives with respect to payment of Director Fees:

               (1)   to receive currently full payment in cash and/or Common
       Stock, as set forth in Section 3(a) above, on the date or dates on which
       the Director Fees are payable;

               (2)   to defer payment of all or a portion  of the Director Fees
       for subsequent payment in cash (a "Cash  Deferral Election");

               (3)   to defer payment of all or a portion of the Director Fees
       for subsequent payment in shares of Common Stock (a "Stock Deferral
       Election"); or

               (4)   a combination of (2) and (3).

       (b) FILING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ELECTIONS. The election by a Director to
receive payment of Director Fees other than as set forth in Section 4(a)(1) on
the date on which the Director Fees are otherwise payable is made by filing with
the Secretary of the Corporation a Notice of Election in the form prescribed by
the Corporation (an "Election"). In order to be effective for any calendar year,
an Election must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation on or before
December 31 of the preceding calendar year, except that if a Director files a
Notice of Election on or before 30 days subsequent to the Director's initial
election to the office of Director, the Election shall be effective on the date
of filing with respect to Director Fees payable for any portion of the calendar
year which remains at the date of such filing. An Election may not be modified
or terminated after the beginning of a calendar year for which it is effective.
Unless modified or terminated by filing a new Notice of Election on or before
December 31 immediately preceding the calendar year for which such modification
or termination is effective, an Election shall be effective for and apply to
Director Fees payable for each subsequent calendar year. Director Fees earned at
any time for which an Election is not effective shall be paid as set forth in
Section 4(a)(1) on the date when the Director Fees are otherwise payable. Any
Election shall terminate on the date a Director ceases to be a member of the
Board.

       (c)     CASH  DEFERRAL  ELECTIONS.  Director Fees deferred  pursuant to a
Cash Deferral Election shall be deferred and paid as provided in Sections 5
and 7.

       (d)     STOCK DEFERRAL  ELECTIONS.  Director Fees deferred  pursuant to a
Stock Deferral  Election shall be deferred and paid as provided in Sections 6
and 7.

                       DEFERRED CASH COMPENSATION ACCOUNT

       (a) GENERAL. The amount of any Director Fees deferred in accordance with
a Cash Deferral Election shall be credited on the date on which such Director
Fees are otherwise payable to a deferred cash compensation account maintained by
the Corporation in the name of the Director (a "Deferred Cash Compensation
Account"). A separate Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall be maintained for
each calendar year for which a Director has elected a different number of
payment installments or as otherwise may be agreed between the Director and the
Corporation.

       (b) ADJUSTMENT FOR EARNINGS OR LOSSES. The amount in the Director's
Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall be adjusted to reflect net earnings,
gains or losses in accordance with the provisions of the Hershey Foods
Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan relating to Investment Credits and
Investment Options. The adjustment for earnings, gains or losses shall be equal
to the amount determined under (1) below as follows:

               (1) DEEMED INVESTMENT OPTIONS. The total amount determined by
       multiplying the rate earned (positive or negative) by each fund available
       (taking into account earnings distributed and share appreciation (gains)
       or depreciation (losses) on the value of shares of the fund) for the
       applicable period by the portion of the balance in the Director's
       Deferred Cash Compensation Account as of the end of each such period,
       respectively, which is deemed to be invested in such fund pursuant to
       paragraph (2) below. Subject to elimination, modification or addition by
       the Board, the funds available for the Director's election of deemed
       investments pursuant to paragraph (2) below shall be the funds available
       (excluding Common Stock) under the Investment Options of the Hershey
       Foods Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan.

               (2)   DEEMED INVESTMENT ELECTIONS.

                     (A) The Director shall designate, on a form prescribed by
               the Corporation, the percentage of the deferred Director Fees
               that are to be deemed to be invested in the available funds under
               paragraph (1) above. Said designation shall be effective on a
               date specified by the Board and remain in effect and apply to all
               subsequent deferred Director Fees until changed as provided
               below.

                     (B) A Director may elect to change, on a calendar year
               basis (or on such other basis as permitted from time to time by
               the Board), the deemed investment election under paragraph (A)
               above with respect to future deferred Director Fees among one or
               more of the options then available by written notice to the
               Secretary of the Corporation, on a form prescribed by the
               Corporation (or by voice or other form of notice permitted by the
               Corporation), at least 10 days before the first day of the
               calendar year for which the change is to be effective, with such
               change to be effective for Director Fees credited to the Deferred
               Cash Compensation Account on and after


                                       4
<PAGE>

               the effective date of the change.


                     (C) A Director may elect to reallocate the balance of his
               Deferred Cash Compensation Account, subject to limitations
               imposed by the Board, on a calendar year basis, among the deemed
               investment options then available. A Director may make such an
               election by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation,
               on a form prescribed by the Corporation (or by voice or other
               form of notice permitted by the Corporation), at least 10 days
               before the first day of the calendar year for which the transfer
               election is to be effective, with such transfer to be based on
               the value of the Deferred Cash Compensation Account on the last
               day of the calendar year preceding the effective date of the
               transfer election.

                     (D) The election of deemed investments among the options
               provided above shall be the sole responsibility of each Director.
               The Corporation and Board members are not authorized to make any
               recommendation to any Director with respect to such election.
               Each Director assumes all risk connected with any adjustment to
               the value of his Deferred Cash Compensation Account. Neither the
               Board nor the Corporation in any way guarantees against loss or
               depreciation.

                     (E) All payments from the Plan shall be made pro-rata from
               the portion of the Director's Deferred Cash Compensation Account
               which is deemed to be invested in such funds as may be available
               from time to time for deemed investment elections under the Plan.

                     (F) The Corporation shall not be required or obligated to
               invest any amounts in the funds provided as deemed investment
               options, and such funds shall be used solely to measure
               investment performance. Further, the Corporation shall not be
               precluded from providing for its liabilities hereunder by
               investing in such funds or in any other investments deemed to be
               appropriate by the Board.

       (c) MANNER OF PAYMENT. The balance of a Director's Deferred Cash
Compensation Account will be paid to the Director or, in the event of the
Director's death, to the Director's designated beneficiary, in accordance with
the Cash Deferral Election. A Director may elect at the time of filing the
Notice of Election for a Cash Deferral Election to receive payment of the
Director Fees in annual installments rather than a lump sum, provided that the
payment period for installment payments shall not exceed ten years following the
Payment Commencement Date, as described in Section 7 hereof. The amount of any
installment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the balance in the Director's
Deferred Cash Compensation Account on the date of such installment by (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the
number of remaining unpaid installments (including the installment payment then
being determined). The balance of the Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall
be appropriately reduced on the date of payment to the Director or the
Director's designated beneficiary to reflect the installment payment made
hereunder. Amounts held pending distribution pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall
continue to be credited with the earnings, gains or losses as described in
Section 5(b) hereof.

                       DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION ACCOUNT

       (a) GENERAL. The amount of any Director Fees deferred in accordance with
a Stock Deferral Election shall be credited to a deferred stock compensation
account maintained by the Corporation in the name of the Director (a "Deferred
Stock Compensation Account"). A separate Deferred Stock Compensation Account
shall be maintained for each calendar year for which a Director has elected a
different number of payment installments or as otherwise determined by the
Board. On each date on which Director Fees are otherwise payable and a Stock
Deferral Election is effective for a Director, the Director's Deferred Stock
Compensation Account for that calendar year shall be credited with a number of
full and fractional Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") equal to the cash amount of
the Director Fees payable divided by the Fair Market Value of one share of the
Common Stock, as defined in Section 12 hereof, on the date on which such
Director Fees are payable. If a dividend or distribution is paid on the Common
Stock in cash or property other than Common Stock, on the date of payment of the
dividend or distribution to holders of the Common Stock each Deferred Stock
Compensation Account shall be credited with a number of full and fractional DSUs
equal to the number of full and fractional DSUs credited to such Account on the
date fixed for determining the stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or
distribution times the amount of the dividend or distribution paid per share of
Common Stock divided by the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, as
defined in Section 12 hereof, on the date on which the dividend or distribution
is paid. If the dividend or distribution is paid in property, the amount of the
dividend or distribution shall equal the fair market value of the property on
the date on which the dividend or distribution is paid. The Deferred Stock
Compensation Account of a Director shall be charged on the date of distribution
with any distribution of shares of Common Stock made to the Director from such
Account pursuant to Section 6(c) hereof.

       (b) ADJUSTMENT AND SUBSTITUTION. The number of DSUs credited to each
Deferred Stock Compensation Account shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect
any dividend or other distribution on the outstanding Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock or any split or consolidation of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock. If the outstanding Common Stock shall, in whole or in part, be
changed into or exchangeable for a different class or classes of securities of
the Corporation or securities of another corporation or cash or property other
than Common Stock, whether through reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation or otherwise, the Board shall adopt such
amendments to the Plan as it deems necessary to carry out the purposes of the
Plan, including the continuing deferral of any amount of any Deferred Stock
Compensation Account.

       (c) MANNER OF PAYMENT. The balance of a Director's Deferred Stock
Compensation Account will be paid in shares of Common Stock to the Director or,
in the event of the Director's death, to the Director's designated beneficiary,
in accordance with the Stock Deferral Election. A Director may elect at the time
of filing of the Notice of Election for a Stock Deferral Election to receive
payment of the shares of Common Stock credited to the Director's Deferred Stock
Compensation Account in annual installments rather than a lump sum, provided
that the payment period for installment payments shall not exceed ten years
following the Payment Commencement


                                       6
<PAGE>


Date as  described  in Section 7 hereof.  The  number of shares of Common  Stock
distributed  in each  installment  shall be  determined by  multiplying  (i) the
number of DSUs credited to such Director's  Deferred Stock Compensation  Account
on the date of payment of such installment, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is one and the  denominator  of which is the  number of  remaining  unpaid
installments  (including the installment  payment then being  determined) and by
rounding such result down to the nearest whole number of shares.  The balance of
the number of DSUs  credited  to such  Director's  Deferred  Stock  Compensation
Account shall be  appropriately  reduced in accordance with this Section 6(c) to
reflect the installment  payments made  hereunder.  DSUs remaining in a Deferred
Stock  Compensation  Account  pending  distribution  of shares  of Common  Stock
pursuant to this  Section  6(c) shall  continue to be credited  with  respect to
dividends or  distributions  paid on the Common  Stock  pursuant to Section 6(a)
hereof and shall be subject to adjustment  pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof. If a
lump sum payment or the final installment  payment hereunder would result in the
issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock,  such fractional share shall not
be  issued  and  cash  in lieu of such  fractional  share  shall  be paid to the
Director  based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock,  as defined
in  Section  12  hereof,  on the  date  immediately  preceding  the date of such
payment. The Corporation shall issue share certificates to the Director,  or the
Director's  designated  beneficiary,  for the shares of Common Stock distributed
hereunder,  or if requested in writing by the Director and permitted  under such
plan,  the shares to be  distributed  shall be added to the  Director's  account
under the Corporation's  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan. As of the date on
which the Director is entitled to receive  payment of shares of Common Stock,  a
Director shall be a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to such shares.


                                        7

                            PAYMENT COMMENCEMENT DATE

       Payment of amounts in a Restricted Stock Unit Account (if vested),
Deferred Cash Compensation Account or a Deferred Stock Compensation Account
shall commence on the first business day next succeeding the 89th day following
the day on which the Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason,
including death or disability. Pursuant to procedures substantially similar to
those contemplated under section 2.1.3 of the EBPP as in effect on the date
hereof, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance of the Board may
provide for the accelerated payment of Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts and
Deferred Stock Compensation Accounts in one lump sum in connection with a Change
in Control notwithstanding any other payment options previously selected by a
Director under his or her Cash Deferral Elections and Stock Deferral Elections.


                                        8

                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

       A Director may designate, in the Beneficiary Designation form prescribed
by the Corporation, any person to whom payments of cash or shares of Common
Stock are to be made if


                                       7
<PAGE>


the  Director  dies before  receiving  payment of all amounts due  hereunder.  A
beneficiary  designation  will be  effective  only after the signed  beneficiary
designation  form is filed  with the  Secretary  of the  Corporation  while  the
Director is alive and will cancel all beneficiary  designations signed and filed
earlier. If the Director fails to designate a beneficiary,  or if all designated
beneficiaries of the Director die before the Director or before complete payment
of all amounts due hereunder,  any remaining unpaid amounts shall be paid in one
lump sum to the  estate  of the last to die of the  Director  or the  Director's
designated beneficiaries, if any.


                                        9

                          NON-ALIENABILITY OF BENEFITS

       Neither the Director nor any beneficiary designated by the Director shall
have the right to, directly or indirectly, alienate, assign, transfer, pledge,
anticipate or encumber (except by reason of death) any amount that is or may be
payable hereunder, nor shall any such amount be subject to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or
garnishment by creditors of the Director or the Director's designated
beneficiary or to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of
any Director or designated beneficiary, or transfer by operation of law in the
event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Director or any beneficiary, or any
legal process.

       Any Restricted Stock Unit Account, Deferred Cash Compensation Account or
Deferred Stock Compensation Account shall be established and maintained only on
the books and records of the Corporation, and no assets or funds of the
Corporation or the Plan or shares of Common Stock of the Corporation shall be
removed from the claims of the Corporation's general or judgment creditors or
otherwise made available until such amounts are actually payable to Directors or
their designated beneficiaries as provided herein. The Plan constitutes a mere
promise by the Corporation to make payments in the future. The Directors and
their designated beneficiaries shall have the status of, and their rights to
receive a payment of cash or shares of Common Stock under the Plan shall be no
greater than the rights of, general unsecured creditors of the Corporation. No
person shall be entitled to any voting rights with respect to shares credited to
any RSU or Deferred Stock Compensation Account which is not yet payable to a
Director or the Director's designated beneficiary. The Corporation shall not be
obligated under any circumstance to fund its financial obligations under the
Plan, and the Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for tax purposes.
However, the Corporation may, in its discretion, set aside funds in a trust or
other vehicle, subject to the claims of its creditors, in order to assist it in
meeting its obligations under the Plan, if such arrangement will not cause the
Plan to be considered a funded deferred compensation plan under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

                   ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN; HARDSHIP WITHDRAWAL

       Full power and authority to construe, interpret, and administer the Plan
shall be vested in the Board. Decisions of the Board shall be final, conclusive,
and binding upon all parties. Notwithstanding the terms of a Cash Deferral
Election or a Stock Deferral Election made by a Director hereunder, the Board
may, in its sole discretion, permit the withdrawal of amounts credited to a
Deferred Cash Compensation Account or shares credited to a Deferred Stock
Compensation Account with respect to Director Fees previously payable, or permit
the early vesting and payment of RSUs previously awarded, upon the request of a
Director or the Director's representative, or following the death of a Director
upon the request of a Director's beneficiary or such beneficiary's
representative, if the Board determines that the Director or the Director's
beneficiary, as the case may be, is confronted with an unforeseeable emergency.
For this purpose, an unforeseeable emergency is an unanticipated emergency
caused by an event that is beyond the control of the Director or the Director's
beneficiary and that would result in severe financial hardship to the Director
or the Director's beneficiary if an early hardship withdrawal were not
permitted. The Director or the Director's beneficiary shall provide to the Board
such evidence as the Board, in its discretion, may require to demonstrate that
such emergency exists and financial hardship would occur if the withdrawal were
not permitted. The withdrawal shall be limited to the amount or to the number of
shares, as the case may be, necessary to meet the emergency. For purposes of the
Plan, a hardship shall be considered to constitute an immediate and unforeseen
financial hardship if the Director has an unexpected need for cash to pay for
expenses incurred by the Director or a member of the Director's immediate family
(spouse and/or natural or adopted children) such as those arising from illness,
casualty loss, or death. Cash needs arising from foreseeable events, such as the
purchase or building of a house or education expenses, will not be considered to
be the result of an unforeseeable financial emergency. Payment shall be made as
soon as practicable after the Board approves the payment and determines the
amount of the payment or number of shares which shall be withdrawn. In the case
of a hardship withdrawal from the Deferred Cash Compensation Account or Deferred
Stock Compensation Account, payment shall be made in a single lump sum from the
portion of the Deferred Cash Compensation Account or Deferred Stock Compensation
Account, as applicable, with the largest number and in reverse order of
installment payments, in each case in accordance with Section 5(b)(2)(E) if the
distribution is from the Deferred Cash Compensation Account. No Director shall
participate in any decision of the Board regarding such Director's request for a
withdrawal under this Section 11.


                                       12

                                FAIR MARKET VALUE

       Fair Market Value of the Common Stock ("Fair Market Value") shall be the
average of the closing price for all trading dates for the applicable period
covered by a payment. The applicable period for a quarterly payment or credit
shall be the three calendar months immediately preceding


                                       9
<PAGE>


the calendar  month during which the day on which the payment or credit is being
made.  The  applicable  period for a payment  relating to a period  other than a
quarter shall be determined under similar  principles.  The closing price of the
Common Stock for each day within the applicable period shall be as quoted in THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL (or in such other  reliable  publication as the Board or its
delegate, in its discretion, may determine to rely upon).


                                       13

                       SECURITIES LAWS; ISSUANCE OF SHARES

       The obligation of the Corporation to issue RSUs or issue or credit shares
of Common Stock under the Plan shall be subject to (i) the effectiveness of a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with
respect to such shares, if deemed necessary or appropriate by counsel for the
Corporation, (ii) the condition that the shares shall have been listed (or
authorized for listing upon official notice of issuance) upon each stock
exchange, if any, on which the Common Stock shares may then be listed and (iii)
all other applicable laws, regulations, rules and orders which may then be in
effect. If, on the date on which any shares of Common Stock would be issued or
DSUs credited to a Deferred Stock Compensation Account, sufficient shares of
Common Stock are not available under the Plan or the Corporation is not
obligated to issue shares pursuant to this Section 13, then no shares of Common
Stock shall be issued or DSUs credited but rather, in the case of Common Stock
to be issued currently, cash shall be paid in payment of the Director Fees
payable, and in the case of a Deferred Stock Compensation Account, Director Fees
and dividends which would otherwise have been credited in DSUs shall be credited
in cash to a Deferred Cash Compensation Account in the name of the Director. The
Board shall adopt appropriate rules and regulations to carry out the intent of
the immediately preceding sentence if the need for such rules and regulations
arises.


                                       14

                                  GOVERNING LAW

       The provisions of this Plan shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.


                                       15

                    EFFECTIVE DATE; AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

         The Plan was adopted by the Board on December 4, 1996, and became
effective  as of January 1, 1997.  The Plan was amended and  restated  effective
October 2, 2001 and December 3, 2002.  The Board may amend or terminate the Plan
at any time,  provided that no such  amendment or  termination  shall  adversely
affect  rights with  respect to amounts or shares then  credited to any Deferred
Cash Compensation Account or Deferred Stock Compensation Account.

              4.3.1    Employee  shall not be eligible to accrue,  earn or

                       Date;

              4.3.2    Employee shall not be eligible to receive any

                       benefit protection program, including its Executive
                       Benefits Protection Plans, whether Group 2, 3 or 3A,
                       its Severance Benefits Plan and its Supplemental
                       Executive Retirement Plan);

              4.3.3    Upon the Effective Date, all Employee's coverage
                       under the Company's short-term and long-term
                       disability plans shall cease;

              4.3.4    Employee shall not be permitted to contribute to a

                       assistance account under the Company's flex benefits
                       plan for any period after December 31, 2002; and

              4.3.5    Employee shall not be eligible to make contributions
                       to, and the Company shall make no matching
                       contribution to, the Employee's ESSIOP account from
                       and after the commencement of the Unpaid Leave of
                       Absence Period.

     4.4      Employee shall not participate in any part of the Long -Term
              Incentive Program ("LTIP") of the KEIP during 2003 or any
              subsequent year and any outstanding contingent target grants
              of Performance Stock Units granted to Employee prior to
              December 31, 2002 are hereby cancelled.

     4.5      Except as provided in the immediately following sentence,
              presentation of a draft of this Agreement to Employee on
              December 11, 2002 for his consideration constitutes notice of
              termination of employment for purposes of Section 8(a) of the
              KEIP. If Employee executes this Agreement on or before
              December 20, 2002, presentation on December 11, 2002 of a
              draft of this Agreement to Employee for his consideration
              shall not constitute a notice of termination of employment for
              purposes of Section 8(a) of the KEIP. Whether Employee has
              received a notice of termination of employment for purposes of
              Section 8(a) the KEIP can be determined only upon the
              occurrence or non-occurrence of certain events following the
              presentation of this Agreement to Employee for his
              consideration. Employee, therefore, shall not be permitted to
              exercise any currently outstanding Options granted to him
              previously under the KEIP unless and until this Agreement


                                       3
<PAGE>


              becomes effective and enforceable. If this Agreement becomes
              effective and enforceable, then from and after the Effective
              Date and through and including his Separation Date, Employee
              shall be considered to be an active employee for purposes of
              any Options granted to him previously under KEIP during any
              years prior to 2003 and may exercise any such Options in
              accordance with the provisions of KEIP (and the terms and
              conditions applicable to any such Options established at the
              time such Options were granted or subsequently) at any time
              prior to his Separation Date.

     4.6      Provided that a notice of termination under the KEIP is not in
              effect pursuant to Section 4.5 above, Employee's rights with
              respect to restricted stock units ("RSUs") granted to Employee
              prior to 2003 shall continue to vest in accordance with the
              KEIP and the terms and conditions applicable to such grants.
              Any RSUs that have not vested on or before the Separation Date
              shall terminate.

     4.7      Employee shall be eligible to receive an award, if any, of his
              contingent target grant for 2002 under the AIP of KEIP subject
              to the terms and conditions of the KEIP and the contingent
              target grant. Employee shall not be entitled to participate in
              or receive any benefits under the AIP of KEIP for 2003 or any
              subsequent year. Payment of award, if any, will be made on or
              before March 15, 2003.

     4.8      During the Leave of Absence  Period,  Employee  shall have no
              assigned  duties and shall  perform no services for the Company.


     4.9      Except as provided  for in Section 6 below,  employee  shall be
              free to seek and accept other employment after the Effective Date.


     4.10     In the event Employee commences other employment during the
              Leave of Absence Period, Employee shall immediately notify the
              Company in writing at 100 Crystal A Drive, Hershey, PA, Attn:
              Vice President, Total Compensation, of his new employment and
              his benefit coverage shall terminate as of the effective date
              of the new employment.

     4.11     Employee shall not be subject to the minimum stockholding
              requirements for Company executives or KEIP participants.

     4.12     The Company will provide for the continuation of comparable
              financial advisory services by Regent Atlantic Capital through
              December 31, 2002, tax preparation services for the tax year
              ending December 31, 2002 and outplacement services pursuant to
              a Company-approved executive outplacement program through
              Drake Beam Morin, Inc. for twelve (12) months beginning
              January 1, 2003.

5.   SEPARATION AND COBRA RIGHTS. Effective as of the earlier of the Separation
Date or benefit coverage  cessation,  as required by the  continuation  coverage
provisions  of Section  4980B of the U. S.  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as
amended  ("THE  CODE"),  Employee  shall be  offered  the  opportunity  to elect
continuation  coverage  under  the group  medical  plan of the  Company  ("COBRA
COVERAGE").  The Company  shall  provide  Employee  with the  appropriate  COBRA


                                       4
<PAGE>


coverage  notice and election form for this purpose.  Employee  shall notify the
Company within two weeks of any change in his  circumstances  that would warrant
discontinuation of his COBRA coverage and benefits (including but not limited to
Employee's  receipt  of  group  medical  and  dental  benefits  from  any  other
employer).  The  existence  and duration of  Employee's  rights and/or the COBRA
rights  of  any  of  Employee's  eligible  dependents  shall  be  determined  in
accordance with Section 4980B of the Code.

6.   CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND PRIVILEGED INFORMATION; NON-COMPETITION. The
parties  agree the terms and  conditions  of that  certain  Long-Term  Incentive
Program Participation  Agreement and Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims by and
between  the  Company  and  Employee   executed  by  Employee  August  21,  2001
("Participation and Arbitration Agreement"), a copy of which is attached hereto,
are  incorporated  herein by  reference  and made a part  hereof as if fully set
forth   herein.   Notwithstanding   any   provisions  to  the  contrary  in  the
Participation and Arbitration Agreement,  the terms and conditions thereof shall
remain in effect for three years after Employee's  Separation Date regardless of
whether Employee is eligible or not to receive benefits under the SERP.

7.   GENERAL RELEASE AND WAIVER BY EMPLOYEE.

     7.1      Employee, for and on behalf of himself and each of his heirs,
              executors, administrators, personal representatives,
              successors and assigns, hereby acknowledges full and complete
              satisfaction of and fully and forever releases, acquits and
              discharges the Company, together with its subsidiaries and

              administrators, personal representatives, successors and

              concealed or hidden, vested or contingent, in law or equity,
              existing by statute, common law, contract or otherwise, which
              have existed, may exist or do exist, through and including the
              execution and delivery by Employee of this Agreement (but not
              including the Parties' performance under this Agreement),
              including, without limitation, any of the foregoing arising
              out of or in any way related to or based upon:

              7.1.1    Employee's application for and employment with the
                       Company, his being an employee of the Company,  or the
                       Separation;

              7.1.2    any and all claims in tort or contract, and any and
                       all claims alleging breach of an express or implied,
                       or oral or written, contract, policy manual or
                       employee handbook;

              7.1.3    any alleged misrepresentation, coercion, duress,
                       defamation, interference with contract, intentional
                       or negligent infliction of emotional distress, sexual
                       harassment, negligence or wrongful discharge; or


                                       5
<PAGE>


              7.1.4    any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or
                       regulation, including but not limited to the Fair
                       Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act, Title VII of
                       the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans With
                       Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act,
                       and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act.

     7.2      Employee acknowledges and agrees that other than to seek the
              Company's performance under this Agreement he is waiving all
              rights to sue or obtain equitable, remedial or punitive relief
              from any or all Releasees of any kind whatsoever, including,
              without limitation, reinstatement, back pay, front pay,
              attorneys' fees and any form of injunctive relief. Employee
              acknowledges and agrees that this waiver and release is an
              essential and material term of this Agreement. Employee
              further acknowledges and agrees that he will not assert any
              breach of any agreement, plan, or right referred to herein
              based on any action or inaction of the Releasees prior to the
              date hereof.

     7.3      Employee understands and intends that this SECTION 7
              constitutes a general release, and that no reference therein
              to a specific form of claim, statute or type of relief is
              intended to limit the scope of such general release and
              waiver; provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision
              of this Section 7, the provisions of this Section 7 shall not
              apply to any rights Employee may have under the Age
              Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended.

     7.4      Employee expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute
              which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown
              claims. Employee understands the significance of his release
              of unknown claims and his waiver of statutory protection
              against a release of unknown claims.

     7.5      Employee agrees that he will not be entitled to or accept any
              benefit from any claim or proceeding within the scope of this
              SECTION 7 general release that is filed or instigated by him
              or on his behalf with any agency, court or other government
              entity.

8.   EMPLOYEE'S REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS REGARDING ACTIONS. Employee
represents, warrants and covenants to each of the Releasees that at no time
prior to or contemporaneous with his execution of this Agreement has he filed or
caused or knowingly permitted the filing or maintenance, in any state, federal
or foreign court, or before any local, state, federal or foreign administrative
agency or other tribunal, any charge, claim or action of any kind, nature and
character whatsoever ("CLAIM"), known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
which he may now have or has ever had against the Releasees which is based in
whole or in part on any matter referred to in SECTION 7.1. above, and, to the
maximum extent permitted by law Employee is prohibited from filing or
maintaining, or causing or knowingly permitting the filing or maintaining, of
any such Claim in any such forum. Employee hereby grants the Company his
perpetual and irrevocable limited power of attorney with full right, power and
authority to take all actions necessary to dismiss or discharge any such Claim.
Employee further covenants and agrees that he will not encourage any person or
entity, including but not limited to any current or former employee, officer,
director or stockholder of the Company, to institute any Claim against the


                                       6
<PAGE>


Releasees or any of them, and that except as expressly permitted by law or
administrative policy or as required by legally enforceable order he will not
aid or assist any such person or entity in prosecuting such Claim.

9.   NO DISPARAGING REMARKS. Employee hereby covenants to each of the Releasees
and agrees that he shall not, directly or indirectly, within or without the
Company, make or solicit or encourage others to make or solicit any disparaging
or negative remarks concerning the Releasees (as defined in SECTION 7 of this
Agreement), or any of their products, services, businesses or activities.
Employee understands that, in addition to the consequences such breach may have
under other provisions of this Agreement, his breach of this SECTION 9 and the
Company's delivery to him of notice of such breach shall result in his
Separation; shall eliminate his entitlement to any subsequent payment or
benefits under this Agreement including, without limitation, to further exercise
any Options under the KEIP; and shall subject him to liability for any damages
arising from such remarks. The Company hereby represents that, as of the date of
its execution of this Agreement as set forth on the signature page hereof,
neither Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, nor
Burton H. Snyder, General Counsel, Secretary and Senior Vice President,
International, had actual knowledge of any violation by Employee of this Section
9.

10.  NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Employee hereby covenants and agrees that he shall
not, directly or indirectly, incur any obligation or commitment, or enter into
any contract, agreement or understanding, whether express or implied, and
whether written or oral, which would be in conflict with his obligations,
covenants or agreements hereunder or which could cause any of his
representations or warranties made herein to be untrue or inaccurate.

11.  CONFIDENTIALITY. The Company and Employee agree that the terms and
conditions of this Agreement are to be strictly confidential, except that
Employee may disclose the terms and conditions to his family, attorneys,
accountants, tax consultants, state and federal tax authorities or as may
otherwise be required by law. The Company may disclose the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the circumstances of Employee's separation as the Company
deems necessary or appropriate to its or its affiliates' or representatives'
officers, employees, board of directors, insurers, attorneys, accountants, state
and federal tax authorities, or as otherwise allowed or required by law.
Employee represents that except as expressly authorized by this SECTION 11 he
has not discussed, and agrees that except as expressly authorized by this
SECTION 11 or by the Company he will not discuss, this Agreement or the
circumstances of his Separation, and that he will take affirmative steps to
avoid or absent himself from any such discussion even if he is not an active
participant therein. EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THE SIGNIFICANCE AND MATERIALITY OF
THIS PROVISION TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND HIS UNDERSTANDING THEREOF.

12. RETURN OF CORPORATE PROPERTY; CONVEYANCE OF INFORMATION. Employee hereby
covenants and agrees to immediately return all documents, keys, ID cards, credit
cards (without further use thereof), laptop computer, and all other items which
are the property of the Company and/or which contain confidential information;
and, in the case of documents, to return any and all materials of any kind and
in whatever medium evidenced, including, without limitation, all hard disk drive
data, diskettes, microfiche, photographs, negatives, blueprints, printed
materials, tape recordings and videotapes.

13.  REMEDIES. In the event that Employee has breached any of his covenants,
agreements or obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall notify
Employee in writing at his home address as shown in the Company's records of the
reason for such determination. The notice shall be sent via hand delivery or
overnight courier. Employee hereby acknowledges and affirms that in the event of
any breach by Employee of any of his covenants, agreements and obligations
hereunder, Employee's Separation shall be effective as of the day the Company
provides notice thereof. Employee further hereby acknowledges and affirms that
in the event of such breach monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate
the Releasees or any of them. Accordingly, in addition to other remedies which
may be available to the Releasees hereunder or otherwise at law or in equity,
any Releasee shall be entitled to specifically enforce such covenants,
obligations and restrictions through injunctive and/or equitable relief, in each
case without the posting of any bond or other security with respect thereto.
Should any provision hereof be adjudged to any extent invalid by any court or
tribunal of competent jurisdiction, each provision shall be deemed modified to
the minimum extent necessary to render it enforceable.

14.  ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. Employee hereby acknowledges and
affirms that he is entering into this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily,
without coercion or duress of any sort, in order to receive the payments and
other consideration from the Company as set forth herein. Employee acknowledges
and affirms that he has been given adequate opportunity to review and consider

being understood and agreed that this Agreement and those agreements, including
the mutual covenants, agreements, acknowledgments and affirmations contained
herein and therein, are intended to constitute a complete settlement and
resolution of all matters set forth in SECTION 7 hereof.

16.  NO STRICT  CONSTRUCTION.  The  language  used in this  Agreement  shall be
deemed to be the language mutually chosen by the Parties to reflect their mutual
intent,  and no doctrine  of strict  construction  shall be applied  against any
Party.

17.  THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The Releasees are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement, and this Agreement may be enforced by each of
them in accordance with the terms hereof in respect of the rights granted to
such Releasees hereunder. Except and to the extent set forth in the preceding
sentence, this Agreement is not intended for the benefit of any person other
than the Parties, and no such other person shall be deemed to be a third party
beneficiary hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is not
the intention of the Company to establish any policy, procedure, course of
dealing or plan of general application for the benefit of or otherwise in
respect of any other employee, officer, director or stockholder, irrespective of
any similarity between any contract, agreement, commitment or understanding
between the Company and such other employee, officer, director or stockholder,
on the one hand, and any contract, agreement, commitment or understanding
between the Company and Employee, on the other hand, and irrespective of any
similarity in facts or circumstances involving such other employee,

validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or
provisions (whether of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application hereto of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the internal law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall control
the interpretation and construction of this Agreement, even though under any
other jurisdiction's choice of law or conflict of law analysis the substantive
law of some other jurisdiction may ordinarily apply.

20.  SEVERABILITY.  The  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of any  provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other
provision  of this  Agreement,  which shall  otherwise  remain in full force and
effect.

21.  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement may be executed in separate  counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken  together

all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that
relate to the subject matter of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims, and all other common law
and statutory claims. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

               Long-Term Incentive Program Participation Agreement


         The undersigned is an executive employee of Hershey Foods Corporation
or one of its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Hershey").
I understand that I have been selected to participate in the Key Employee
Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), including the Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP")
under the Plan. I understand, acknowledge and agree that the purpose of this
Agreement is to provide for enhanced confidentiality requirements, an agreement
not to compete with Hershey once I become eligible for supplemental retirement
benefits, and an arbitration program to be the sole and exclusive method for
resolving disputes. I understand and acknowledge that by this Agreement, both I
and Hershey, in order to avoid delay and expense, are mutually waiving the right
of access to a judicial forum for resolving disputes covered by the arbitration
program. I hereby accept the opportunity to participate in the Plan, including
the LTIP, and in consideration of my selection by Hershey to be a participant in
the Plan and being eligible to receive benefits under the Plan, I agree to the
following:


1.       PARTICIPATION.

         I understand and agree that participating in the LTIP at any time is no
guarantee I will be selected to participate in the LTIP or any other aspect of
the Plan in any future years. I understand and agree that participation in the
Plan and the LTIP is voluntary; specifically, I understand that I am under no
obligation to participate in the LTIP or any other aspect of the Plan, and that
I may retain my job if I decline to so participate. I understand and agree that
if I elect to participate in the Plan and the LTIP, then, depending on my job
performance, the financial performance of Hershey and the achievement of certain
goals and objectives, I will be eligible to receive Annual Incentive Program
Awards, Performance Stock Unit Awards and Stock Options, in accordance with the
terms of the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.


2.       CONFIDENTIALITY.

         I acknowledge that due to the nature of my employment and the position
of trust that I hold with Hershey, I will have special access to, learn, be
provided with, and in some cases will prepare and create for Hershey, trade
secrets and other confidential and proprietary information relating to Hershey's
business, including, but not limited to, information about Hershey's
manufacturing processes; manuals, recipes and ingredient percentages;
engineering drawings; product and process research and development; new product
information; cost information; supplier data; strategic business information;
marketing, financial and business development information, plans, forecasts,
reports and budgets; customer information; new product strategies, plans and
project activities; and acquisition and divestiture strategies, plans and
project activities. I acknowledge and agree that such information, whether or
not in written form, is the exclusive property of Hershey, that it has been and
will continue to be of critical importance to the business of Hershey, and that
the disclosure of it to, or use by, competitors or others will cause Hershey
substantial and irreparable harm. Accordingly, I will not, either during my
employment or at


                                       1
<PAGE>


any  time  after  the  termination  (whether  voluntary  or  involuntary)  of my
employment with Hershey,  use,  reproduce or disclose any trade secrets or other
confidential  information  relating  to the  business  of  Hershey  which is not
generally  available to the public,  except as may be specially  authorized  and
necessary  in  discharging  my assigned  duties as an  employee  of  Hershey.  I
understand  and agree  that my  obligations  under  this  Agreement  shall be in
addition to,  rather than in lieu of, any  obligations  I may already have under
any  Confidentiality  Agreement  or other  agreement  with  Hershey  relating to
confidential information or under any applicable statute or at common law.


3.       UNFAIR COMPETITION.

         I understand and acknowledge that Hershey is engaged in the business of
developing, producing, marketing, selling and distributing confectionery
products and chocolate-related grocery products. I acknowledge that the scope of
Hershey's business and operations is world-wide. I acknowledge that due to the
nature of my employment with Hershey, I have special access to, contact with,
and information about, Hershey's business activities as described above and to
its customers, suppliers, agents, licensees and licensors. I acknowledge that
Hershey has incurred considerable expense and invested considerable time and
resources in developing relationships with customers, suppliers, agents,
licensees and licensors, and that those relationships are critical to the
success of Hershey's business.

         Accordingly, both (a) during the term of my employment with Hershey,
and (b) for a period of three (3) years following the termination of my
employment for any reason, provided at the time of such termination I am
eligible to receive benefits under Hershey's Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan, I shall not, without the prior written consent of Hershey, directly or
indirectly serve or act as an officer, director, employee, consultant, adviser,
agent or representative for the domestic or worldwide confectionery or
chocolate-related grocery businesses of any entity or individual that is in
competition with Hershey's confectionery or chocolate-related grocery
businesses.


4.       SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS.

         Both I and Hershey understand and agree that our respective rights and
obligations under, and the terms and conditions of, this Agreement (and the
Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims appended hereto) shall apply and continue
during, and survive the termination (for any reason) of, my employment with
Hershey.


5.       ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION.

         Both I and Hershey promise to arbitrate any claim covered by the Mutual
Agreement to Arbitrate Claims which is attached hereto and incorporated in full
herein by reference.

         Both I and Hershey further agree, before seeking arbitration of any
claim, to engage in good faith efforts to resolve the dispute through nonbinding
mediation. Mediation shall be


                                       2
<PAGE>


conducted by, and in accordance with procedures for the mediation of employment
disputes of, one of the American Arbitration Association, the Judicial
Arbitration + Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS/Endispute) or the Center for Public
Resources (CPR) as Hershey and I may agree (and if such agreement is not
possible, then the mediation procedures of CPR shall apply), together with any
other procedures as may be agreed upon by me and Hershey.


6.       SAVINGS CLAUSE AND SEVERABILITY.

         a. All provisions of this Agreement (and of the Mutual Agreement to
Arbitrate Claims appended hereto) are severable, and if any of them is
determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining
provisions and portions shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full
force to the fullest extent permitted by law.

         b. Without limiting the foregoing, I specifically agree that each of
the covenants set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement is severable; that if
any of them is held invalid or unenforceable by reason of length of time, area
covered or activity covered, or any combination thereof, or for any other
reason, the court or arbitrator shall adjust, reduce or otherwise reform any
such covenant to the extent necessary to cure any invalidity and to protect the
interests of Hershey to the fullest extent of the law; that the area, time
period and scope of activity restricted shall be the maximum area, time period
and scope of activity the court or arbitrator deems valid and enforceable; and
that, as reformed, such covenant shall then be enforced.

         c. Without limiting the foregoing, I also specifically agree that if
any part of the Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims is determined to be invalid
or unenforceable for any reason, then the invalid or unenforceable portion shall
be severed and the agreement to submit any claim to binding arbitration shall be
interpreted and enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable portion did not
appear.


7.       MISCELLANEOUS.

         a. Any notice to Hershey shall be in writing and shall be sent by
certified mail to Hershey Foods Corporation, 100 Crystal A Drive, Hershey, PA
17033-0810, Attention: Vice President, Human Resources. Any notice to me shall
be in writing and shall be sent to me by certified mail at the latest address

Hershey in writing that notice shall be delivered to me at a different address.
Notice shall be deemed delivered when personally delivered or a properly
addressed notice is deposited with the U.S. Postal Service for delivery by
certified mail.

         b. I understand and agree that neither this Agreement nor the Mutual
Agreement to Arbitrate Claims shall be construed in any way as an agreement or
guarantee of employment for any period of time and that I remain an
employee-at-will for all purposes.

         c.       The rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement  and the
Mutual  Agreement to Arbitrate  Claims shall inure to the benefit of, shall be

Hershey Foods Corporation, and their successors and assigns.

         d. Any waiver by either Hershey or me of any breach, or the failure to
enforce any of the terms or conditions, of this Agreement or the Mutual
Agreement to Arbitrate Claims, shall not in any way affect, limit, or waive any
rights thereafter to enforce, and compel strict compliance with, every term and
condition of this Agreement and the Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims.

         e. This Agreement and the Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims

amended only by an instrument in writing executed by me and an authorized
officer of Hershey.

         f. The substantive law governing this Agreement shall be the law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The law of arbitrability shall be that set forth
in the Federal Arbitration Act. If for any reason the Federal Arbitration Act is
inapplicable, then the law of arbitrability shall be that of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

               Long-Term Incentive Program Participation Agreement

                      Mutual Agreement To Arbitrate Claims


         I recognize that differences may arise between Hershey Foods
Corporation (the "Company") and me during or following my employment with the
Company, and that those differences may or may not be related to my employment.
I understand and agree that by entering into this Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate
Claims ("Arbitration Agreement"), I anticipate gaining the benefits of a speedy,
impartial dispute-resolution procedure.

         I understand that any reference in this Arbitration Agreement to the
Company will be a reference also to all subsidiary and affiliated entities, all
benefit plans, the benefit plans' sponsors, fiduciaries, administrators,
affiliates and agents, and all successors and assigns of any of them.


A.       CLAIMS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

         The Company and I mutually consent to the resolution by arbitration of
all claims or controversies ("claims"), past, present, or future, whether or not
arising out of my employment (or its termination), that the Company may have
against me or that I may have against the Company or against its officers,
directors, employees or agents in their capacity as such. The only claims that
are arbitrable are those that, in the absence of this Arbitration Agreement,
would have been justiciable under applicable state or federal law. The claims
covered by this Arbitration Agreement include, but are not limited to, claims
arising out of, connected with or relating to the Long-Term Incentive Program
Participation Agreement and this Arbitration Agreement; claims for wages or
other compensation due; claims for breach of any contract or covenant (express
or implied); tort claims; claims for discrimination (including, but not limited
to, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, age, marital
status, or medical condition, handicap or disability); claims for benefits
(except claims under an employee benefit or pension plan that either specifies
that its claims procedure shall culminate in an arbitration procedure different
from this one or is underwritten by a commercial insurer which decides claims);
and claims for violation of any federal, state, or other governmental law,
statute, regulation, or ordinance, except as otherwise provided in this
Arbitration Agreement.


B.       CLAIMS NOT COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

         Claims I may have for workers' compensation or unemployment
compensation benefits are not covered by this Agreement.

         Also not covered are claims by the Company for injunctive and/or other
equitable relief, including but not limited to those for unfair competition
and/or the use and/or unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential
information, as to which I understand and agree that the Company may seek and
obtain relief from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such an


                                       5
<PAGE>


injunctive/equitable proceeding, I understand and agree that the court is
entitled to and will award to the prevailing party costs and actual attorneys'
fees incurred.


C.       REQUIRED NOTICE OF ALL CLAIMS.

         The Company and I agree that the aggrieved party must give written
notice of any claim to the other party. Written notice to the Company, or its
officers, directors, employees or agents, shall be sent pursuant to the notice
provision of the Agreement to which this Arbitration Agreement is appended.

The written notice shall identify and describe the nature of all claims asserted
and the facts upon which such claims are based.


D.       REPRESENTATION.

         Any party may be represented by an attorney or other representative
selected by the party.


E.       DISCOVERY.

         Each party shall have the right to take the deposition of one
individual and any expert witness designated by another party. Each party also
shall have the right to make requests for production of documents to any party.
The subpoena right specified below shall be applicable to discovery pursuant to
this paragraph. Additional discovery may be had only where the arbitrator
selected pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement so orders, upon a showing of
substantial need.


F.       DESIGNATION OF WITNESSES.

         At least 30 days before the arbitration, the parties must exchange
lists of witnesses, including any expert, and copies of all exhibits intended to
be used at the arbitration.


G.       SUBPOENAS.

         Each party shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and documents for
the arbitration.


H.       ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.

         The arbitration will be held under the auspices of one of the American
Arbitration Association, Judicial Arbitration + Mediation Services, Inc. or
Center for Public Resources, with the designation of such sponsoring
organization to be made by the party that did not initiate the claim.


                                       6
<PAGE>


         The arbitration shall be confidential and closed to the public. Any
evidence proffered in the arbitration shall be held in strict confidence and not
disclosed to any third party.

         The Company and I agree that, except as provided in this Agreement, the
arbitration shall be in accordance with the then-current dispute arbitration
procedures of the sponsoring organization for the type of claim involved. The
arbitration shall take place in or near the location in which I am or was last
employed by the Company.

         The Arbitrator shall be selected as follows. The sponsoring
organization shall give each party a list of 7 arbitrators. Each party may
strike all names on the list it deems unacceptable. If only one common name
remains on the lists of all parties, that individual shall be designated as the
Arbitrator. If more than one common name remains on the lists of all parties,
the parties shall strike names alternately from the list of common names until
only one remains. The party who did not initiate the claim shall strike first.
If no common name exists on the lists of all parties, the sponsoring
organization shall furnish an additional list and the process shall be repeated.
If no arbitrator has been selected after two lists have been distributed, then
the parties shall strike alternately from a third list, with the party
initiating the claim striking first, until only one name remains. That person
shall be designated as the Arbitrator.

         The Arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of
remedies, if applicable) of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or federal law, or
both, as applicable to the claim(s) asserted. The Arbitrator is without
jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law, or law of remedies. The
Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply. The Arbitrator, and not any federal,
state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including but not limited to any claim
that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties, except as provided in
this Arbitration Agreement.

         The Arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to hear and rule on pre-hearing
disputes and is authorized to hold pre-hearing conferences by telephone or in
person, as the Arbitrator deems necessary. The Arbitrator shall have the
authority to entertain a motion to dismiss and/or a motion for summary judgment
by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

         Either party, at its expense, may arrange for and pay the cost of a
court reporter to provide a stenographic record of proceedings.

         Either party, upon request at the close of hearing, shall be given
leave to file a post-hearing brief. The time for filing such a brief shall be
set by the Arbitrator.

         The Arbitrator shall render a proposed award and opinion in the form
typically rendered in labor arbitrations.

         Either party shall have the right, within 20 days of issuance of the
Arbitrator's proposed award and opinion, to file with the Arbitrator a motion to
reconsider (accompanied by a


                                       7
<PAGE>


supporting brief), and the other party shall have 20 days from the date of the
motion to respond. The Arbitrator thereupon shall reconsider the issues raised
by the motion and, promptly, either confirm or change the decision, which
(except as provided by this Arbitration Agreement) shall then be final and
conclusive upon the parties. The costs of such a motion for reconsideration and
written opinion of the Arbitrator shall be borne by the party prevailing on the
motion, unless the Arbitrator orders otherwise.


I.       ARBITRATION FEES AND COSTS.

         The Company and I shall equally share the fees and costs of the
Arbitrator; provided, however, that my maximum contribution will be no more than
20% of the amount at issue. Each party will deposit funds or post other
appropriate security for its share of the Arbitrator's fee, in an amount and
manner determined by the Arbitrator, 10 days before the first day of hearing.
Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys' fees, if any. However, if
any party prevails on a statutory claim which affords the prevailing party
attorneys' fees, or if there is a written agreement providing for fees, the
Arbitrator may award fees to the prevailing party as provided by statute or
agreement.


J.       EXCLUSIVITY, WAIVER AND BINDING EFFECT.

         The procedure set out in this Arbitration Agreement is the exclusive
procedure for resolving claims covered hereunder. The resolution of any claim
covered by this Arbitration Agreement pursuant to the procedure set out herein
shall be final and binding on the parties to the fullest extent permitted by
law. Both I and the Company expressly waive any right to resolve any claim
covered by this Arbitration Agreement through any other means, including by
filing a lawsuit in court for trial by the court or before a jury. Both I and
the Company are precluded from bringing or raising in court or before another
forum any claim which could have been brought or raised hereunder, unless the
right to pursue a statutory claim or remedy is expressly preserved by law.
Neither I nor the Company shall seek to enjoin any proceeding hereunder on the
basis that any award resulting therefrom would not be enforceable.


K.       INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

         I understand and agree that the Company is engaged in transactions
involving interstate commerce.


L.       CONSIDERATION.

         The promises by the Company and by me to arbitrate differences, rather
than litigate them before courts or other bodies, provide consideration for each
other. In addition, my participation in this Long-Term Incentive Program
provides further consideration for this Arbitration Agreement.

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                          Broad Based Stock Option Plan

                  (Amended and Restated as of August 19, 2002)

         1.  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

         The purpose of the Broad Based Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to
provide to participating employees of Hershey Foods Corporation (the
"Corporation") and its subsidiaries (as defined below), upon whose efforts the
Corporation is dependent for the successful conduct of its business, an
incentive to continue and increase their efforts as employees and to remain in
the employ of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. To accomplish this purpose,
the Corporation's Board of Directors ("Board") has authorized the Compensation
and Executive Organization Committee of the Board (the "Committee") to grant,
from time to time in its sole discretion and in accordance with the Plan,
options ("Options") to purchase shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $1.00
par value (the "Common Stock").

         2.  STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

         The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock for which Options may be
granted pursuant to this Plan is two million (2,000,000), subject to adjustment
in accordance with Paragraph 11 below. The shares of Common Stock issued upon
exercise of Options granted under this Plan may be either authorized but
unissued shares, treasury shares held by the Corporation or any direct or
indirect subsidiary thereof, or shares acquired by the Corporation through open
market purchases (whether made before or after the exercise of the Options) or
otherwise. In addition to the shares of Common Stock actually issued or
distributed upon exercise of Options granted under the Plan, there shall be
deemed to have been issued a number of shares equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock in respect of which optionees utilize the manner of exercise of,
and payment for, Options as provided in Paragraph 5(e)(iii) of the Plan. If, for
any reason, any Option granted under the Plan expires or terminates or is
forfeited or surrendered, the number of shares of Common Stock for which such
Option was granted shall be disregarded in determining whether the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock for which Options may be granted has been
reached.

         3.  ADMINISTRATION

         The Plan shall be administered by the Committee or any successor
committee appointed by the Board. The Committee may adopt such rules and
regulations as it deems useful in governing its affairs. Any action of the
Committee with respect to the administration of the Plan shall be taken by
majority vote at a Committee meeting or written consent of all Committee
members.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee shall
have authority: (i) to construe and interpret Plan provisions; (ii) to define
the terms used in the Plan; (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan; (iv) to determine the terms,



<PAGE>


conditions,  form and amount of grants, including conditions upon and provisions
for vesting,  exercise and acceleration of any grants; and (v) to make all other
determinations  necessary or advisable for the  administration  and operation of
the  Plan.  The  Committee  shall  have the right to  impose  varying  terms and
conditions  with  respect  to  each  grant  or  award.  All  determinations  and
interpretations  made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive on
all Participants and on their legal representatives and beneficiaries.

         Any dispute or disagreement which shall arise under, as a result of, or
in any way relate to the interpretation, construction or administration of the
Plan or the Options granted hereunder shall be determined in all cases by the
procedures established by the Plan, as amended or supplemented by the Committee.
All disputes or disagreements shall be initially submitted to the Vice President
of Human Resources of the Corporation for resolution. The Participant or his
legal representative or beneficiary will submit to the Vice President of Human
Resources a summary of the dispute and all materials supporting his or her
position on the matter. The Corporation will also submit materials to support
its position on the matter. The Vice President of Human Resources shall render a
decision in writing within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the submissions by
both parties. Participant or the Corporation may appeal the decision of the Vice
President of Human Resources to the Committee, but such appeal must be submitted
to the Committee within fifteen (15) calendar days of the decision by the Vice
President of Human Resources. The Committee will review the material submitted
by the parties to the Vice President of Human Resources and any additional
material the parties may wish to submit to support their position. The Committee
will render its decision in writing by the later of forty-five (45) calendar
days of its receipt of the submissions by both parties or the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Committee following the receipt of the submissions. The
decision by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes.

         4.  ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

         With regard to the initial grant of Options under the Plan to be made
by the Committee at its January 7, 1997 meeting (the "Initial Grant"), the
following employees are eligible to participate in the Plan: (i) employees of
the Corporation; (ii) employees of any U.S., Canadian, or Mexican wholly-owned
subsidiary, and employees of Hershey Japan Company, Ltd, a subsidiary of Hershey
International Ltd., Hershey Corporation ZAO, a subsidiary of Hershey Holding
Corporation, and employees of the Corporation's representative offices in Russia
and China (each called a "Subsidiary Corporation" and collectively called the
"Subsidiary Corporations"), provided they were full-time employees of the
Corporation or a Subsidiary Corporation on December 3, 1996. Full-time employees
who were on paid or unpaid leave of absence, layoff, or disability on December
3, 1996 are eligible to participate in the Initial Grant provided they performed
at least one hour of work for the Corporation during 1996. In addition to the
employees described in the first two sentences of this Paragraph 4, an employee
of the Corporation on December 3, 1996 shall be eligible for participation in
the Initial Grant if such individual performed at least one hour of work for the
Corporation, or any Subsidiary Corporation, as an employee in 1996 and in five
(5) of the six (6) years 1990 through 1995. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Paragraph 4, no individual who (i) as of December 3, 1996 was a
temporary employee (as defined in the Corporation's Human Resources Policy
Manual) of the Corporation; (ii) as of December 3, 1996 was a leased employee
(as hereinafter defined); or (iii) on January 7, 1997 is eligible to receive a
stock option grant under


                                       2
<PAGE>


the  Corporation's  Key Employee  Incentive  Plan ("KEIP") shall be eligible for
participation in the Initial Grant. For purposes of the Initial Grant, a "leased
employee"  shall  be  defined  as  an  employee  of an  entity  other  than  the
Corporation,  or any  Subsidiary  Corporation,  who  performs  services  for the
Corporation,  or any Subsidiary Corporation,  on a short- or long-term basis and
who,  in the  performance  of such  services,  may (but  need  not) be under the
primary direction or control of the Corporation,  or any Subsidiary Corporation.
Persons who would  otherwise be classified as "leased  employees"  under Section
414(n) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any successor provision,  shall,
without limitation of the immediately preceding sentence and for purposes of the
Initial Grant, be deemed "leased employees."

         In the event that the Committee elects, in its sole discretion, to
grant Options at any time following the Initial Grant, it shall prescribe
eligibility criteria for each such grant at the time of the grant, provided
however, that in each such case, temporary employees, leased employees, and
employees who on the date of the grant are eligible to receive stock options
under the Corporation's KEIP shall not be eligible to participate in the grant.

         Any employee meeting the eligibility criteria established pursuant to
this Paragraph 4 for the Initial Grant or any subsequent grant, or the estate of
such employee if deceased, shall, for the purposes of such grant, be hereinafter
referred to as a "Participant."

         5.  TERMS OF GRANT

         The Initial Grant and any other option grants which may be made by the
Committee shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, as well as
such additional consistent terms and conditions as the Committee may establish
at the time of such grant:

             (a) The exercise  price per share with respect to each Option shall
be  determined by the  Committee in its sole  discretion,  but shall not be less
than 100% of the Fair  Market  Value of the  Common  Stock as of the date of the
grant  of the  Option.  As  used in the  Plan  (unless  a  different  method  of
calculation is required by applicable law, and except as otherwise  specifically
provided in any Plan provision),  "Fair Market Value" on or as of any date shall
mean (i) the closing price of the Common Stock as reported in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite  Transactions Report (or any other consolidated  transactions
reporting  system which  subsequently  may replace such  Composite  Transactions
Report) for the New York Stock Exchange  trading day immediately  preceding such
date, or if there are no sales on such date, on the next  preceding day on which
there were sales, or (ii) in the event that the Common Stock is no longer listed
for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,  an amount  determined in accordance
with  standards  adopted by the  Committee.

             (b) Options  granted under the Plan shall be  exercisable for such
periods as shall be provided by the Committee at the time of granting, but in no
event shall any Option  granted  extend for a period in excess of ten (10) years
from the date of grant.

             (c) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no Option granted
hereunder  may be  exercised  during the first five (5) years  after the date of
grant by the Committee.


                                      3
<PAGE>


             (d) Exercise of an Option shall be accomplished in the form
and manner established by the Committee.

             (e) The purchase price upon exercise of any Option shall be paid in
full by the Participant to the Corporation by making payment either (i) in cash,
or (ii) in a simultaneous  exercise of the Option and sale of the shares thereby
acquired  pursuant  to a  brokerage  arrangement  approved  in  advance  by  the
Committee to assure its conformity with the terms and conditions of the Plan, or
(iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii).

         6.  VESTING

             (a) All Options granted under this Plan shall have a five (5) year
vesting  requirement  and  shall be  subject  to such  other  vesting  terms and
conditions as the  Committee  shall  prescribe in the grant.  With regard to the
Initial Grant a  Participant  must (i) perform at least one hour of work for the
Corporation  or a Subsidiary  Corporation  during each of the years 1997 through
2001 and (ii) be a  full-time  or  part-time  employee of the  Corporation  or a
Subsidiary  Corporation or a Chocolate  World Flex Force Employee (as defined in
the Human  Resources  Policy Manual) on January 6, 2002 in order to satisfy this
vesting  requirement.  Participants  who retire under a  retirement  plan of the
Corporation  or  terminate  employment  after  attaining  age  55  ("retire"  or
"retirement"),  die or become  disabled on or after December 4, 1996, but before
the close of business on January 6, 2002,  shall not forfeit their Options under
the Initial  Grant,  but shall maintain such rights in the Options to the extent
set forth in Paragraph 7(b) below.

             (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or of the terms
and  conditions  of any grant of Options  hereunder,  upon the  occurrence  of a
Change in Control,  each  outstanding and unexpired Option held by a Participant
who is an employee  of the  Corporation  or any  Subsidiary  Corporation  or who
retired,  died or became  disabled  while  employed  by the  Corporation  or any
Subsidiary Corporation shall become fully vested and exercisable notwithstanding
any vesting schedule or installment  schedule relating to the  exercisability of
such Option established at the time of the grant of the Option.

             (c) For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" means:

                (1)  Individuals  who, on December 3, 1996, constitute the Board
          (the  "Incumbent  Directors")  cease for any reason to  constitute  at
          least a majority  of the Board,  provided  that any person  becoming a
          director  subsequent to December 3, 1996, whose election or nomination
          for  election  was  approved by a vote of at least  two-thirds  of the
          Incumbent  Directors  then on the Board (either by specific vote or by
          approval  of the proxy  statement  of the  Corporation  in which  such
          person is named as nominee for director,  without written objection to
          such nomination) shall be an Incumbent  Director;  provided,  however,
          that no individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the
          Corporation  as a result of an actual or threatened  election  contest
          (as  described  in Rule  14a-11  under the  Exchange  Act)  ("Election
          Contest") or other  actual or  threatened  solicitation  of proxies or
          consents  by or on behalf of any  person  (as such term is  defined in
          Section  3(a)(9) of the Exchange  Act and as used in Section  13(d)(3)
          and  14(d)(2) of the  Exchange  Act)  ("Person")  other than the Board
          ("Proxy Contest"), including by


                                       4
<PAGE>


          reason  of any  agreement  intended  to avoid or settle  any  Election
          Contest or Proxy Contest,  shall be deemed an Incumbent Director;  and
          provided  further,  however,  that a director who has been approved by
          the  Hershey  Trust  while it  beneficially  owns more than 50% of the
          combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the
          Corporation  entitled to vote  generally  in the election of directors
          (the "Outstanding  Corporation Voting Power") shall be deemed to be an
          Incumbent Director; or

                (2)  The acquisition or holding by any Person of beneficial
          ownership  (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act
          and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of shares of the
          Common  Stock  and/or  the  Class B Common  Stock  of the  Corporation
          representing  25% or  more of  either  (i) the  total  number  of then
          outstanding  shares of both Common  Stock and Class B Common  Stock of
          the  Corporation  (the  "Outstanding  Corporation  Stock") or (ii) the
          Outstanding  Corporation  Voting Power;  provided that, at the time of
          such  acquisition  or  holding  of  beneficial  ownership  of any such
          shares,  the Hershey Trust does not  beneficially own more than 50% of
          the Outstanding Corporation Voting Power; and provided,  further, that
          any such  acquisition or holding of beneficial  ownership of shares of
          either Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the  Corporation by any
          of the following entities shall not by itself constitute such a Change
          in  Control   hereunder:   (i)  the  Hershey  Trust;  (ii)  any  trust
          established by the  Corporation or by any Subsidiary  Corporation  for
          the  benefit of the  Corporation  and/or its  employees  or those of a
          Subsidiary  Corporation  or by  any  Subsidiary  Corporation  for  the
          benefit  of  the  Corporation  and/or  its  employees  or  those  of a
          Subsidiary  Corporation;  (iii) any employee  benefit plan (or related
          trust)  sponsored or maintained by the  Corporation  or any Subsidiary
          Corporation;  (iv) the Corporation or any Subsidiary  Corporation;  or
          (v) any  underwriter  temporarily  holding  securities  pursuant to an
          offering of such securities; or

                (3)  The approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of any
          merger, reorganization,  recapitalization, consolidation or other form
          of business  combination  (a  "Business  Combination")  if,  following
          consummation of such Business Combination,  the Hershey Trust does not
          beneficially  own  more  than  50% of the  total  voting  power of all
          outstanding  voting securities of (x) the surviving entity or entities
          (the  "Surviving  Corporation")  or (y) if  applicable,  the  ultimate
          parent   corporation   that  directly  or  indirectly  has  beneficial
          ownership  of more than 50% of the  combined  voting power of the then
          outstanding  voting  securities  eligible  to elect  directors  of the
          Surviving Corporation; or

                (4)  The approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of (i)
          any  sale or  other  disposition  of all or  substantially  all of the
          assets of the Corporation, other than to a corporation (the "Acquiring
          Corporation")  if,  following  consummation  of  such  sale  or  other
          disposition,  the Hershey Trust beneficially owns more than 50% of the
          total voting power of all outstanding  voting  securities  eligible to
          elect directors (x) of the Acquiring Corporation or (y) if applicable,
          the  ultimate  parent  corporation  that  directly or  indirectly  has
          beneficial  ownership of more than 50% of the combined voting power of
          the then outstanding voting securities  eligible to elect directors of
          the Acquiring Corporation, or (ii) a liquidation or dissolution of the
          Company.

         For purposes of this Plan, "Hershey Trust" means either or both of (a)
the Hershey Trust Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, as Trustee for the Milton
Hershey School, or any successor to the Hershey Trust Company as such trustee,
and (b) the Milton Hershey School, a Pennsylvania not-for-profit corporation.

             (d) For purposes of this Plan, a "Potential Change in Control"
means:

                (1)  The Hershey Trust by action of any of the Board of
          Directors of Hershey  Trust  Company;  the Board of Managers of Milton
          Hershey School; the Investment  Committee of the Hershey Trust; and/or
          any of the officers of Hershey Trust Company or Milton  Hershey School
          (acting with  authority)  undertakes  consideration  of any action the
          taking of which  would lead to a Change in Control as defined  herein,
          including,  but not limited to  consideration  of (i) an offer made to
          the  Hershey  Trust  to  purchase  any  number  of its  shares  in the
          Corporation  such that if the Hershey  Trust  accepted  such offer and
          sold such number of shares in the  Corporation the Hershey Trust would
          no longer  have more than 50% of the  Outstanding  Corporation  Voting
          Power,  (ii) an  offering  by the  Hershey  Trust of any number of its
          shares  in the  Corporation  for  sale  such  that if such  sale  were
          consummated  the  Hershey  Trust would no longer have more than 50% of
          the Outstanding  Corporation  Voting Power, or (iii) entering into any
          agreement or understanding  with a person or entity that would lead to
          a Change in Control; or

                (2)  The Board  approves a transaction  described in subsection
          (2), (3) or (4) of the definition of a Change in Control  contained in
          subparagraph (c) of Paragraph 6 hereof.

             (e) In the event that a transaction which would constitute a Change
in Control if approved by the stockholders of the Corporation is to be submitted
to such stockholders for their approval, each Participant who is an employee and
who holds an Option  granted under the Plan at the time scheduled for the taking
of such vote, whether or not then exercisable, shall have the right to receive a
notice at least ten (10)  business  days prior to the date on which such vote is
to be  taken.  Such  notice  shall  set  forth  the date on which  such  vote of
stockholders is to be taken, a description of the transaction  being proposed to
stockholders for such approval,  a description of the provisions of subparagraph
(b) of Paragraph 6 of the Plan and a description  of the impact  thereof on such
Participant in the event that such stockholder approval is obtained. Such notice
shall  also set forth the  manner in which and price at which all  Options  then
held by each such  Participant  could be  exercised  upon the  obtaining of such
stockholder approval.

         7.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

         Upon termination of the employment with the Corporation of any
Participant, such Participant's rights with respect to any Options granted under
this Plan shall be as follows:

             (a) In the  event that the  participant is terminated or discharged
by the  Corporation  for  any  reason,  except  as to and  the  extent  provided
otherwise  by the  Committee  in writing and except as provided  below after the
occurrence of a Change in Control,  the


                                       6
<PAGE>


participant's  rights and interests under the Plan shall  immediately  terminate
upon notice of termination of employment.

         Upon the occurrence of a Potential Change in Control and for a period
of one (1) year thereafter, the following special provision and notice
requirement shall be applicable in the event of the termination of the
employment of any participant holding an Option under the Plan: (i) in no event
may a notice of termination of employment be issued to such a participant unless
at least ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of such termination,
the participant is provided with a written notice of intent to terminate the
participant's employment which sets forth in reasonable detail the reason for
such intent to terminate, the date on which such termination is to be effective,
and a description of the participant's rights under this Plan and under the
agreements granting such Option or Options, including the fact that no such
Option may be exercised after such termination has become effective and the
manner, extent and price at which all Options then held by such participant may
be exercised; and (ii) such notice of intent to terminate a participant's
employment shall not be considered a "notice of termination of employment" for
purposes of the first sentence of this Paragraph 7(a). This Paragraph 7(a) is
intended only to provide for a requirement of notice to terminate upon the
occurrence of the events set forth herein and shall not be construed to create
an obligation of continued employment or a contract of employment in any manner
or to otherwise affect or limit the Corporation's ability to terminate the
employment of any participant holding an Option under the Plan.

         Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control and for a period of two (2)
years thereafter, in the event of the termination of a participant's employment
by the Corporation for any reason other than for Cause (as defined below) or by
the participant for Good Reason (as defined below), such participant shall have
one (1) year from the date of termination of employment to exercise such Option
or until the date of expiration of the Option, if earlier. In addition, all
restrictions and limitations on the exercise of such Option or the sale of
shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to exercise of an Option relating to
minimum stockholding requirements shall immediately terminate upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control.

         For purposes of this Plan, "Cause" means, with respect to a participant
who is covered under the Hershey Foods Corporation Employee Benefits Protection
Plan (Group 2), the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits Protection Plan
(Group 3), or the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits Protection Plan
(Group 3A), "cause" as defined in the plan applicable to such participant, and
with respect to all other participants, means (a) the willful and continued
failure of an employee to substantially perform the employee's duties with the
Corporation (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to
physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance
is delivered to the employee by the employee's supervisor which specifically
identifies the manner in which the employee's supervisor believes that the
employee has not substantially performed the employee's duties; or (b) the
willful engaging by the employee in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is
materially and demonstrably injurious to the Corporation. For purposes of the
preceding clauses (a) and (b), no act or failure to act, on the part of the
employee, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be
done, by the employee in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the
employee's action or omission was in the best interests of the Corporation. Any
act, or failure to act, based upon the instructions or with the approval of a
senior officer of the Corporation or the employee's superior or based upon the
advice


                                       7
<PAGE>


of counsel for the  Corporation  shall be  conclusively  presumed to be done, or
omitted to be done,  by the employee in good faith and in the best  interests of
the Corporation.

         For purposes of this Plan, "Good Reason" means, with respect to a
participant who is covered under the Hershey Foods Corporation Employee Benefits
Protection Plan (Group 2), the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits
Protection Plan (Group 3), or the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits
Protection Plan (Group 3A), "good reason" as defined therein, and with respect
to all other participants, means "good reason" as defined in the Hershey Foods
Corporation Amended and Restated Severance Benefits Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Change in Control.

             (b) If a Participant's employment with the Corporation terminates
as a result of his or her becoming  disabled (in which event termination will be
deemed to occur on the date of such determination), or as a result of retirement
or death, Participant or his or her estate shall continue to be a Participant in
the  Plan  and  may,  for a  period  of up to five  (5)  years  from the date of
disability, death or retirement,  exercise such Options pursuant to the terms of
this Plan. With regard to the Initial Grant,  any Participant  whose  employment
with the  Corporation  terminates in a manner  described in this  Paragraph 7(b)
during the period  beginning  December  4,  1996,  and ending  with the close of
business on January 31,  1997,  shall have the right to exercise  Options  which
have  vested  under the Plan  until the close of  trading  on the New York Stock
Exchange  on January 31,  2002.  Any  provision  of this  Paragraph  7(b) to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  no Option  granted  pursuant  to this Plan  shall be
capable of being  exercised  prior to its  becoming  vested,  or  following  its
expiration date.

             (c) In the event that a Participant resigns from employment with
the  Corporation,  the  Participant's  rights and interests under the Plan shall
immediately  terminate  upon  such  resignation;  provided,  however,  that  the
Committee  shall  have  the  absolute  discretion  to  review  the  reasons  and
circumstances of the resignation and to determine whether, alternatively, and to
what  extent,  if any,  the  Participant  may  continue  to hold any  rights  or
interests under the Plan.

             (d) A transfer of a Participant's employment without an intervening
period from the  Corporation to a Subsidiary  Corporation or vice versa, or from
one  Subsidiary  Corporation  to another,  shall not be deemed a termination  of
employment.   A  Participant's   transfer  to  a  non-participating   Subsidiary
Corporation shall also not be deemed a termination of employment for purposes of
this  section.  The  sale of a  participating  or  non-participating  Subsidiary
Corporation  shall,  unless  the  Committee  determines  otherwise,  be deemed a
termination  of the  Participant's  employment  under  paragraph  7(c) above and
employees of such  subsidiary  shall no longer be deemed eligible to participate
in the Plan and must  exercise  their  Options  (if  vested)  prior to the sale.
Options  which  are not  vested  at the  time of sale  will be  terminated.  Any
provision of this Paragraph 7(d) to the contrary  notwithstanding,  with respect
to the  Initial  Grant,  any  Participant  who,  on the  date  of the  sale of a
participating or non-participating  Subsidiary Corporation, has attained the age
of 55,  died or become  disabled  while  employed by the  Corporation,  shall be
deemed to have terminated their employment pursuant to Paragraph 7(b), and shall
continue to be Participants under the Plan in accordance with that paragraph.


                                       8
<PAGE>



             (e) The Committee shall be authorized to make all determinations
and  calculations  required by this  Paragraph 7,  including any  determinations
necessary to establish the reason for terminations of employment for purposes of
the Plan, which  determinations and calculations shall be conclusive and binding
on any affected Participants and estates.

         8.  Additional Requirements

         No Options granted pursuant to the Plan shall be exercisable or
realized in whole or in part, and the Corporation shall not be obligated to
sell, distribute or issue any shares subject to any such Option, if such
exercise and/or sale would, in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation,
violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or other federal or state
statutes, or foreign statutes having similar requirements), or exceed daily
volume limitations imposed by the Corporation from time to time on sales of
Common Stock. Each Option shall be subject to the further requirement that, if
at any time the Committee shall determine in its discretion that the listing or
qualification of the shares relating or subject to such Option under any
securities exchange requirements or under any applicable law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a
condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Option or the
distribution or the issue of shares thereunder, such Option may not be exercised
in whole or in part unless such listing, qualification, consent or approval
shall have been effected or obtained free of any condition not acceptable to the
Board.

         A Participant's interest in Options granted under this Plan may be
subject to restrictions or other special rules as to grant, exercise, resale or
other disposition and to such other provisions as may be appropriate to comply
with federal, state and/or foreign securities and other applicable laws and
stock exchange requirements, and the grant or exercise of any Option or
entitlement to payment thereunder may be contingent upon receipt from the
Participant (or any other person permitted by this Plan to exercise any Option
or receive any distribution hereunder) of a representation that at the time of
such exercise it is his or her then present intention to acquire the shares
being distributed for investment and not for resale.

         9.  NONTRANSFERABILITY

         Options granted under this Plan to a Participant shall be nonassignable
and shall not be transferable by him or her otherwise than by will or the laws
of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during the employee's
lifetime, only by the employee or the employee's guardian or legal
representative.

         10. DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

         No provision in the Plan or any Options granted pursuant to the Plan
shall be construed to confer upon the Participant any right to be employed by
the Corporation or by any Subsidiary Corporation, or to interfere in any way
with the right and authority of the Corporation or any Subsidiary Corporation
either to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant at any time,
or to terminate any relationship of employment between the Participant and the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiary Corporations.


                                       9
<PAGE>



         Participants under the Plan shall have none of the rights of a
stockholder of the Corporation with respect to shares subject to Options, unless
and until such shares have been issued to him or her.

         11. STOCK ADJUSTMENTS

         In the event that the shares of Common Stock, as presently constituted,
shall be changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of
stock or other securities of the Corporation or of another corporation (whether
by reason of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
split, combination of shares or otherwise), or if the number of such shares of
Common Stock shall be increased through the payment of a stock dividend, or a
dividend on the shares of Common Stock of rights or warrants to purchase
securities of the Corporation shall be made, then there shall be substituted for
or added to each share available under and subject to the Plan as provided in
Paragraph 2 hereof, and each share theretofore appropriated or thereafter
subject or which may become subject to Options, under the Plan, the number and
kind of shares of stock or other securities into which each outstanding share of
Common Stock shall be so changed or for which each such share shall be exchanged
or to which each such share shall be entitled, as the case may be. Outstanding
options also shall be appropriately amended as to price and other terms as may
be necessary to reflect the foregoing events. In the event there shall be any
other change in the number or kind of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or
of any stock or other securities into which the Common Stock shall have been
changed or for which it shall have been exchanged, then if the Board shall, in
its sole discretion, determine that such change equitably requires an adjustment
in the shares available under and subject to the Plan, or in any Options granted
under the Plan, such adjustments shall be made in accordance with such
determination.

         No fractional shares of Common Stock or units of other securities shall
be issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from any
such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding downward to the
nearest whole share or unit.

         12. TAXES

         The Corporation shall be entitled to withhold the amount of any tax
attributable to any amounts payable or shares of Common Stock deliverable under
the Plan. The person entitled to any such delivery upon the exercise of an
Option may, by notice to the Corporation, elect to have such withholding
satisfied by a reduction of the number of shares otherwise so deliverable, or by
delivery of shares of stock already owned by the Participant, with the amount of
shares subject to such reduction or delivery to be calculated based on the Fair
Market Value of such shares on the date of such taxable event.

         13. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

         The Plan shall become effective upon adoption by the Board. The Board
at any time may terminate the Plan, but such termination shall not alter or
impair any of the rights or obligations under any grant of Options theretofore
made under the Plan unless the affected Participant shall so consent.


                                       10
<PAGE>


         14. APPLICATION OF FUNDS

         The proceeds received by the Corporation from the sale of capital stock
pursuant to Options will be used for general corporate purposes.

         15. NO OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE OPTION

         The granting of an Option shall impose no obligation upon the
Participant to exercise such Option.

         16. AMENDMENT

         The Board, by majority vote at any time and from time to time, may
amend the Plan in such respects as it shall deem advisable, to conform to any
change in any applicable law or in any other respect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Broad Based Stock
Option Plan to be amended and restated as of the 19th day of August, 2002.

        FOODS CORPORATION<br>
        MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Hershey Foods Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) are engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of confectionery and grocery products. The Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927, as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2"><B>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2"><B>Net Sales</B></FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Net sales decreased
        $16.9 million from 2001 to 2002, primarily as a result of increased promotion
        costs and returns, discounts, and allowances, the divestiture of the <i>Heide</i>
        brands in 2002 and the <i>Luden&#146;s</i> throat drop business in 2001,
        and the timing of sales related to the gum and mint business acquired
        from Nabisco Inc. (&#147;Nabisco&#148;), which resulted in incremental
        sales in 2001 compared with 2002. A sluggish retail environment, characterized
        by the bankruptcies and store closings of certain customers, also contributed
        to the lower sales. Sales were also lower in several international markets,
        particularly Canada and Brazil. These sales decreases were partially offset
        by volume increases of key confectionery brands, including new products
        and line extensions, and selected confectionery selling price increases,
        as well as incremental sales from the Visagis acquisition, the Brazilian
        chocolate and confectionery business acquired in July, 2001.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In December 2002, the Corporation announced an increase of 11% in the price of standard-size candy bars effective January 1, 2003, representing an average increase of approximately 3% over the entire domestic product line. A buy-in prior to the January 1, 2003 price increase resulted in an approximate 1% to 2% increase in fourth quarter, 2002 sales.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Net sales rose $316.8 million, or 8%, from 2000 to 2001. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to incremental sales from the mint and gum business acquired from Nabisco in December 2000 and increases in sales of base confectionery and grocery products, primarily resulting from the introduction of new confectionery products, selected confectionery selling price increases in the United States, and increased international exports. These increases were partially offset by lower sales resulting from higher promotional allowances, the divestiture of the <i>Luden&#146;s</i> throat drops business and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2"><B>Cost of Sales</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Cost of sales decreased $107.5 million, or 4%, from 2001 to 2002. Cost of sales in 2002 included $6.4 million of costs primarily related to the relocation of equipment associated with the Corporation&#146;s business realignment initiatives. Cost of sales in 2001 included $50.1 million associated with business realignment initiatives recorded in the fourth quarter of that year. Excluding costs related to the business realignment initiatives in both years, cost of sales decreased $63.8 million from 2001 to 2002, primarily as a result of lower costs for certain major raw materials, primarily cocoa, milk and packaging materials and reduced supply chain costs, particularly related to shipping and distribution.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Gross margin increased from 35.5% in 2001 to 37.8% in 2002. Gross margin in 2001 was negatively impacted 1.2 percentage points from the inclusion in cost of sales of a charge of $50.1 million associated with business realignment initiatives recorded during the fourth quarter of that year. Gross margin in 2002 was reduced by .2 percentage points from business realignment charges of $6.4 million recorded in cost of sales during the year. Excluding the impact of the business realignment initiatives in both years, the increase in gross margin from 36.7% in 2001 to 38.0% in 2002 primarily reflected decreased costs for certain major raw materials, higher profitability resulting from the mix of confectionery items sold in 2002 compared with sales in 2001 and the impact of supply chain efficiencies. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by higher promotion</FONT></P></td></tr>

Gross margin was also unfavorably impacted in 2002 by poor profitability in the Corporation&#146;s Canadian and Brazilian businesses.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Cost of sales increased $197.4 million, or 8%, from 2000 to 2001. Cost of sales in 2001 included a charge of $50.1 million associated with business realignment initiatives recorded during the fourth quarter. The $50.1 million charge to cost of sales resulted from the reduction of raw material inventories, principally cocoa beans and cocoa butter, no longer required to support operations as a result of outsourcing the manufacturing of certain ingredients. Excluding the impact of the business realignment initiatives, cost of sales increased $147.3 million, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with increased sales volume, partially offset by lower costs for freight, distribution and warehousing, as well as improved supply chain efficiencies including decreased costs for the disposal of aged finished goods inventory and obsolete packaging.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Gross margin increased from 35.3% in 2000 to 35.5% in 2001.

Excluding the impact of the business realignment initiatives, the increase in gross margin to 36.7% in 2001 resulted from lower costs for freight, distribution and warehousing, as well as improved supply chain efficiencies, including decreased costs for the disposal of aged finished goods inventory and obsolete packaging. Selected confectionery selling price increases and the profitability of the mint and gum business acquired from Nabisco also contributed to the higher gross margin in 2001. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to higher labor rates and employee benefits costs, as well as start-up costs
associated

 with the installation of new manufacturing equipment.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2"><B>Selling, Marketing and Administrative</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $13.6 million, or 1.6% in 2002, primarily as a result of savings from the business realignment initiatives and the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002, offset by $17.2 million of expenses incurred to explore the possible sale of the Corporation, as discussed below. Excluding incremental expenses incurred to explore the Corporation&#146;s sale in 2002 and the impact of the amortization of intangibles in 2001, selling, marketing, and administrative expenses decreased $16.0 million, or 2%, from 2001 to 2002. The decrease in 2002 primarily reflected lower advertising, depreciation and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher expenses associated with increased consumer marketing programs and selling activities.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">On July 25, 2002, the Corporation confirmed that the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the Benefit of Milton Hershey School (the &#147;Milton Hershey School Trust&#148;) which controls 77.6% of the combined voting power of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, had informed the Corporation that it had decided to diversify its holdings and in this regard wanted Hershey Foods to explore a sale of the entire Corporation. On September 17, 2002, the Milton Hershey School Trust informed the Corporation that it had elected not to sell its controlling interest and requested that the process to explore a sale be terminated.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $120.4 million, or 17%, from 2000 to 2001, primarily reflecting selling, marketing and administrative expenditures for the newly acquired mint and gum business, increased administrative expenses primarily resulting from higher staffing levels to support sales activity in North America and international businesses, increased marketing expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. Selling, marketing and administrative costs in 2000 included a one-time gain of $7.3 million arising from the sale of certain corporate aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In late October 2001, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors approved a plan to improve the efficiency and profitability of the Corporation&#146;s operations. The plan included asset management improvements,</FONT></P></td></tr>

Total costs for the business realignment initiatives were $312.4 million compared to the $310.0 million announced in January 2002. The increased costs related primarily to higher pension settlement costs associated with the voluntary work force reduction program (&#147;VWRP&#148;) which were recorded as incurred, and more than offset the impact of the greater than expected proceeds from the sale of certain assets.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">During 2002, charges to cost of sales and business realignment and asset impairments were recorded totaling $34.0 million before tax. The total included a charge to cost of sales of $6.4 million associated with the relocation of manufacturing equipment and a net business realignment and asset impairments charge of $27.6 million. Components of the net $27.6 million pre-tax charge included a $28.8 million charge for pension settlement losses resulting from the VWRP, a $3.0 million charge for pension curtailment losses and special termination benefits resulting from manufacturing plant closures, a $.1 million charge relating to involuntary termination benefits and a $.1 million charge relating to the realignment of the domestic sales organization, partially offset by a $4.4 million favorable adjustment reflecting higher than estimated proceeds from the sale of certain assets.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">During the fourth quarter of 2001, charges to cost of sales and business realignment and asset impairments were recorded totaling $278.4 million before tax. The total included a charge to cost of sales of $50.1 million associated with raw material inventory reductions and a business realignment and asset impairments charge of $228.3 million. Components of the $228.3 million pre-tax charge included $175.2 million for business realignment charges and $53.1 million for asset impairment charges. The $175.2 million for business realignment charges included $139.8 million for enhanced pension and other post-retirement benefits associated with the VWRP and $35.4 million for other costs associated with the business realignment initiatives. The $53.1 million for asset impairment charges included $45.3 million for fixed asset impairments and $7.8 million for goodwill impairment.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">These initiatives are expected to generate $75 million to $80 million of annual savings when fully implemented and contributed savings of approximately $38.0 million in 2002. As of December 31, 2002, there have been no significant changes to the estimated savings for the business realignment initiatives. The major components of these initiatives were completed as of December 31, 2002. Remaining transactions primarily pertain to the sale of certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities, as discussed below, and possible pension settlement costs related to employee retirement decisions.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Asset management improvements included the decision to outsource the manufacture of certain ingredients and the related removal and disposal of machinery and equipment related to the manufacture of these ingredients. As a result of this outsourcing, the Corporation was able to significantly reduce raw material inventories, primarily cocoa beans and cocoa butter, in the fourth quarter of 2001. The remaining portion of the project was substantially completed during the first quarter of 2002.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Product line
        rationalization plans included the sale or exit of certain businesses,
        the discontinuance of certain non-chocolate confectionery products and
        the realignment of the Corporation&#146;s sales organizations. Costs associated
        with the realignment of the sales organizations related primarily to sales
        office closings and terminating the use of certain sales brokers. During
        2002, sales offices were closed as planned and the use of certain sales
        brokers was discontinued which resulted in an additional charge of $.1
        million. During the second quarter, the sale of a group of the Corporation&#146;s
        non-chocolate confectionery candy brands to Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers
        Candy Company, Inc. (the &#147;sale of certain confectionery brands to
        Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers&#148;) was completed. Included in the transaction
        were the <i>Heide, Jujyfruits, Wunderbeans</i> and <i>Amazin&#146; Fruit</i>
        trademarked confectionery brands, as well as the rights to sell <i>Chuckles</i>
        branded products, under license. Proceeds of $12.0 million associated
        with the sale of certain confectionery brands to Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers
        exceeded the 2001 estimates which resulted in a $4.4 million favorable
        adjustment. Also during the second quarter, the Corporation discontinued
        and subsequently licensed the sale of its aseptically packaged drink products
        in the United States. Net sales for these brands were $11.6 million, $34.2
        million and $38.3 million in 2002,</FONT></P></td></tr>

The sale of certain confectionery brands to Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers resulted in the closure of a manufacturing facility in New Brunswick, New Jersey which was being held for sale as of December 31, 2002. An additional charge of $.7 million relating to pension curtailment losses and special termination benefits associated with the closure of the facility was recorded in 2002.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">To improve supply
        chain efficiency and profitability, three manufacturing facilities, a
        distribution center and certain other facilities were planned to be closed.
        These included manufacturing facilities in Denver, Colorado; Pennsburg,
        Pennsylvania; and Palmyra, Pennsylvania and a distribution center and
        certain minor facilities located in Oakdale, California. During the first
        quarter of 2002, the manufacturing facility in Palmyra, Pennsylvania was
        closed and additional costs of $.1 million were recorded, as incurred,
        relating to retention payments. During the second quarter, operations
        utilizing the distribution center in Oakdale, California ceased. The manufacturing
        facilities in Denver, Colorado and Pennsburg, Pennsylvania were closed
        in the fourth quarter of 2002. An additional charge of $2.3 million relating
        to pension curtailment losses and special termination benefits associated
        with the facility closures was recorded in 2002. The Denver, Colorado
        facility was being held for sale and the Pennsburg, Pennsylvania facility
        was idle and being held for possible future use as of December 31, 2002.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In October 2001, the Corporation offered the VWRP to certain eligible employees in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico in order to reduce staffing levels and improve profitability. The VWRP consisted of an early retirement program which provided enhanced pension, post-retirement and certain supplemental benefits and an enhanced mutual separation program which provided increased severance and temporary medical benefits. A reduction of approximately 500 employees occurred during 2002 as a result of the VWRP. Additional pension settlement costs of $28.8 million were recorded in 2002, principally associated with lump sum payments of pension benefits.</FONT></P>

The decrease in the effective income tax rate of .6 percentage points in 2002 primarily reflected the impact of the elimination of the amortization of intangibles effective January 1, 2002. The decrease of 1.5 percentage points from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to the lower tax rate on the mint and gum business acquired in December 2000.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Current assets increased by $96.1 million, or 8%, principally reflecting increased cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other current assets, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes. The increase in cash and cash equivalents reflected strong cash flows from operations during the year, offset by contributions of $308.1 million to the Corporation&#146;s pension plans. Prepaid expenses and other current assets reflected higher prepaid pension expense associated with the funding of pension plans during the year and increased original margin balances for commodity futures. The elimination of current deferred income taxes resulted primarily from the significant liability related to the tax effect on other comprehensive income associated with the gains on commodity futures contracts during the year.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Property, plant and equipment was lower than the prior year primarily due to depreciation expense of $155.4 million and the retirement of property, plant and equipment of $19.0 million, partially offset by capital additions of $132.7 million.

Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors, with the Common Stock having one vote per share and the Class B Stock having ten votes per share. However, the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is entitled to elect one-sixth of the Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, the Common Stock is entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In December 2000, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement (&#147;Rights Agreement&#148;). The Rights Agreement was supported by the Corporation&#146;s largest stockholder, the Milton Hershey School Trust. This action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the Corporation. Under the Rights Agreement, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right (&#147;Right&#148;) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock is traded. The Rights Agreement is discussed further in Note 15 to
the
Consolidated Financial Statements.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Historically, the Corporation&#146;s major source of financing has been cash generated from operations. The Corporation&#146;s income and, consequently, cash provided from operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales patterns, the timing of new product introductions, business acquisitions and divestitures, and price changes. Sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year, representing seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, seasonal working capital needs peak during the summer months and have been met by issuing commercial paper.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Over the past three years, cash provided from operating activities exceeded cash requirements for dividend payments, capital expenditures and capitalized software additions, share repurchases, incentive plan transactions and business acquisitions by $177.1 million. Also during the period, the Corporation made contributions to its pension plans of $490.7 million. Total debt decreased during the period by $209.9 million, reflecting reduced short-term borrowings and the repayment of long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $179.7 million during the period.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation anticipates that capital expenditures and capitalized software additions will be in the range of $150 million to $200 million per annum during the next several years as a result of continued efficiency improvements in existing facilities and capacity expansion to support sales growth and new products, along with continued improvement and enhancements of computer software. As of December 31, 2002, the Corporation&#146;s principal capital commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion to support sales growth and new products, modernization and efficiency improvements and selected enhancements of computer software.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Contributions totaling $308.1 million were made to the pension plans during 2002 primarily to improve the funded status as a result of negative returns on pension plan assets during the year. In order to improve the funded status of the Corporation&#146;s domestic pension plans, a contribution of $75.0 million was made in February 2001. An additional contribution of $95.0 million was made in December 2001 to fund payments related to the early retirement program implemented in the fourth quarter of that year.</FONT></P>

        of December 31, 2001, $250 million of debt securities remained available

        any offering of the $250 million of debt securities available under the

The Corporation may increase the credit facilities to $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the banks. In November 2002, the short-term credit facility agreement was renewed with a credit limit of $200 million expiring in November 2003. The long-term committed credit facility agreement with a $200 million credit limit will expire in November 2006. The credit facilities may be used to fund general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions. The Corporation also had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks of $21.0 million and $21.7 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,

Over this period, cash used by or provided from accounts receivable and inventories has tended to fluctuate as a result of sales during December and inventory management practices. Cash provided from inventories was principally associated with a reduction of raw material inventories in December 2001 as part of the Corporation&#146;s business realignment initiatives. The change in cash required for or provided from other assets and liabilities between the years was primarily related to hedging transactions, the timing of payments for accrued liabilities, including income taxes, and variations in the funded status of pension plans.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation

        Purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase
        of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers to minimize the
        effect of future price fluctuations. Total obligations for each year are
        comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and
        unpriced contracts which have been valued using market prices as of December
        31, 2002. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts
        is variable as market prices change over future periods. However, the
        variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the Corporation&#146;s
        futures price cover for those periods. Accordingly, increases or decreases
        in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures
        contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of December
        31, 2002 and in future periods. These obligations are satisfied by taking
        delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished
        goods. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002,
        such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making
        payment for the specific commodities.</FONT></P></td></tr>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation
        has entered into three off-balance sheet arrangements for the leasing
        of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. These off-balance sheet
        arrangements enabled the Corporation to lease these facilities under more
        favorable terms than other leasing alternatives. The operating lease arrangements
        are with special purpose trusts (&#147;SPTs&#148;) whereby the Corporation
        leases warehouse and distribution facilities in Redlands, California;
        Atlanta, Georgia; and Hershey, Pennsylvania, as discussed below. The SPTs
        were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the
        facilities to the Corporation. The SPTs financed the acquisition of the
        facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent third-party
        financial institutions. The independent third-party financial institution
        which holds the equity certificates is the owner of the SPTs. The owner
        of the SPTs has made substantive residual equity capital investments in
        excess of 3% which will be at risk during the entire term of each lease.
        Accordingly, the Corporation is not permitted to consolidate the SPTs
        because all of the conditions for consolidation have not been met. Aside
        from the residual guarantees and instrument guarantees associated with
        the individual leasing arrangements, as discussed below, the Corporation
        has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of these entities.
        The obligations in connection with these leases have not been collateralized
        by the Corporation. The Corporation has no obligations with respect to
        refinancing of the lessor&#146;s debt, would incur no significant penalties
        which would result in the reasonable assurance of continuation of the
        leases and has no significant guarantees in addition to the residual and
        instrument guarantees discussed below. There are no other material commitments
        or contingent liabilities associated with the leasing arrangements. The

Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Interpretation No. 46, <i>&#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of

which the usual condition for consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, <i>&#147;Consolidated
Financial Statements,&#148;</i> does not apply because the SPEs have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Interpretation is effective for calendar year companies beginning in the third quarter of 2003 and it is reasonably possible that the Interpretation will require the consolidation of the Corporation&#146;s three off-balance sheet arrangements with SPTs for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities as described in Note 4, Commitments. The consolidation of these entities will result in an increase to property, plant and equipment of approximately $120.0 million, with a corresponding increase to long-term debt and minority interest. The consolidation of these entities will also result in an increase to depreciation expense of approximately $5.0 million on an annual basis.</FONT></P>

SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that changes in the derivative&#146;s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting
criteria are
 met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative&#146;s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement, to the extent effective, and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.</FONT></P>

The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. All derivative instruments currently utilized by the Corporation, including interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and commodities futures contracts, are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Prior to January 1, 2001, accounting for commodities futures contracts was in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 80, <i>&#147;Accounting for Futures Contracts.</i>&#148; Futures contracts met the hedge criteria and were accounted for as hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses were deferred and recognized in cost of sales as part of the product cost.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts (unrealized gains and losses) are made on a daily basis and prior to January 1, 2001, were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 1, 2001, the Corporation accounted for commodities futures contracts under SFAS No. 133, as amended, and accordingly, cash transfers are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs in the future. Futures being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases.</FONT></P>

        as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic

        Changes to the assumed rates of participant termination, disability and

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">For 2002, the Corporation used a discount rate assumption of 7.0% in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for all plans, except for a domestic plan which used 6.5% after August 31, 2002 due to the calculation of a settlement loss on that date. The settlement also required plan assets and obligations to be valued with updated assumptions as of that date for the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for the period from August 31, 2002 through December 31, 2002. For 2001 and 2000, a discount rate assumption of 7.5% was used in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2002 net periodic pension benefits cost by $6.9 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have
decreased 2002

 net periodic pension benefits cost by $4.4 million. The Corporation&#146;s discount rate represents the estimated rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. In order to estimate this rate, the Corporation considers the yields of several high-quality fixed income investments including 30 year AA and A Corporate bonds as well as the yield of the Merrill Lynch index for 10+ year high quality Corporate bonds.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation reduced its discount rate assumption to 6.3% for valuing obligations as of December 31, 2002 from 7.0% as of December 31, 2001, due to the declining interest rate environment. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2002 pension benefits obligations by $89.6 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2002 pension benefits obligations by $75.4 million.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">For 2002, 2001 and 2000, an asset return assumption of 9.5% was used in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefits cost was based on the fair market value of pension plan assets. The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost. A one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2002 net periodic pension benefits cost by $6.2 million and a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2002 net periodic pension benefits cost by $6.2 million.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation&#146;s
        pension asset investment policies specify ranges of pension asset allocation
        percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension
        plans were as follows: large-capitalization domestic equities, 40%&#150;55%;
        small/mid-capitalization domestic equities, 10%&#150;20%; international
        equities, 5%&#150;15%; fixed income investments, 15%&#150;35%; and cash,
        0%&#150;5%. As of December 31, 2002, the actual allocations were within
        the ranges, except for fixed income investments which were slightly below
        the minimum point of the range and cash which was approximately 18% of
        plan assets. During December 2002, $150 million was contributed to the
        domestic pension plans which was not yet invested into one of the asset
        classes as of December 31, 2002. The level of volatility in pension plan
        asset returns is expected to be in line with the overall volatility of
        the markets and weightings within the asset classes disclosed.</FONT></P></td></tr>

The geometric average asset return assumptions for the asset classes were as follows: large-capitalization domestic equities, 8.9%; small/mid-capitalization domestic equities, 9.9%; international equities, 9.4%; and fixed income investments, 6.5%. The historical geometric average return over the 15 years prior to December 31, 2002 was approximately 8.9%.

        January 1, 2002. Through December 31, 2001, goodwill resulting from business
        acquisitions was amortized over 40 years. The reassessment of the useful
        lives of intangible assets acquired on or before June 30, 2001 was completed
        during the first quarter of 2002. Amortization of goodwill resulting from
        business acquisitions of $388.7 million was discontinued as of January

        1, 2002 primarily consisted of trademarks and patents obtained through

        to be indefinite and, therefore, amortization of these assets was discontinued

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Corporation enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. Prior to January 1, 2001, accounting for commodities futures contracts was in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 80, &#147;<i>Accounting for Futures Contracts.&#148;</i> Futures contracts met the hedge criteria and were accounted for as hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses were deferred and recognized in cost of sales as part of the product cost.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, <i>&#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;</i> (&#147;SFAS No. 133&#148;). Subsequently, the FASB issued Statement No. 137, <i>&#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#151;Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133&#148;</i> and Statement No. 138, <i>&#147;Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.&#148;</i> SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that changes in the derivative&#146;s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting
criteria are
 met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative&#146;s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement, to the extent effective, and requires that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Going forward, the Corporation has set balanced long-term goals, including: three to four percent revenue growth; continued gross margin expansion; nine to eleven percent growth in earnings per share; improvement in returns on invested capital and continued market share gains. In December 2002, the Corporation announced an increase of approximately 11% in the price of standard-size candy bars effective January 1, 2003, representing an average increase of 3% over the entire domestic product line. Sales volume growth in 2003 is expected to be somewhat lower than the Corporation&#146;s long-term goal as a result of the price increase and sales growth in the first quarter of 2003 will be lower as a result of the buy-in in the fourth quarter of 2002.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation intends to make further gains in market share and to increase spending on brand building and selling capabilities in 2003. Results in 2003 will also benefit from cost savings generated from the business realignment initiatives and continued control of administrative costs.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation expects to expand margins in 2003, as the Corporation continues to increase sales in more profitable product lines and improve operating efficiencies throughout the supply chain. In addition, commodity costs are anticipated to be relatively stable in 2003 as a result of the Corporation&#146;s forward purchasing and hedging practices. The Corporation plans to achieve earnings per share growth of nine to eleven percent in 2003 from its operating performance and execution of its share repurchase program, as discussed below.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Profitability in future periods is affected by various factors, including sales volume, selling prices, raw material and logistics costs, manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period. Cocoa market prices rose sharply during 2002 and this increase accelerated following a rebellion in the world&#146;s largest cocoa producing country, the Ivory Coast. Continued civil unrest in the Ivory Coast could result in further cocoa price increases. The Corporation&#146;s costs during 2003 and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices, premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times, and supply</FONT></P></td></tr>

The Corporation&#146;s costs for cocoa will increase substantially in 2004; however, the Corporation expects to achieve its long-term goals for growth and profitability by a combination of price increases and/or product weight changes, improved sales mix, supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset potential cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation expects strong cash flows from operating activities in 2003. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. The Corporation will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate. The Corporation announced on December 12, 2002, that it is authorized to acquire up to $500 million of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock in open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This authorization is expected to be completed within approximately 12 months, subject to trading liquidity, and will be funded by cash provided from operations and short-term borrowings.</FONT></P>

        Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Certain reclassifications
        have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the 2002 presentation.
        During 2000 and 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s
        Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) addressed various issues
        related to the income statement classification of certain promotional
        payments, including consideration from a vendor to a reseller or another
        party that purchases the vendor&#146;s products. EITF No. 01-9, <i>&#147;Accounting
        for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or Reseller of the Vendor&#146;s
        Products,&#148;</i> was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier pronouncements.
        In accordance with EITF No. 01-9, certain consumer and trade promotion
        expenses, such as consumer coupon redemption expense, off-invoice allowances
        and various marketing performance funds previously reported in selling,
        marketing and administrative expense were reclassified as a reduction
        of net sales. Reclassifications for 2001 and 2000 were $423.0 million
        and $400.6 million, respectively. In addition, certain freight billings
        totaling $3.0 million for 2001, previously reported in cost of sales,
        were reclassified as an increase to net sales.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The consolidated financial statements include the impact of the Corporation&#146;s business realignment initiatives as described in Note 3. Cost of sales included charges resulting from the business realignment initiatives of $6.4 million and $50.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Additionally, selling, marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002, included expenses of $17.2 million associated with the exploration of the potential sale of the Corporation.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2"><B>Principles of Consolidation</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2"><B>Use of Estimates</B></FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The preparation
        of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
        accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
        assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
        at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during
        the period. Critical accounting estimates involved in applying the Corporation&#146;s
        accounting policies are those that require management to make assumptions
        about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate
        was made and those for which different estimates reasonably could have
        been used for the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate
        that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, and would have
        a material impact on the presentation of the Corporation&#146;s financial
        condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The
        Corporation&#146;s most critical accounting estimates pertain to accounting
        policies for accounts receivable&#151;trade, accrued liabilities and pension
        and other post-retirement benefit plans.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation records sales when all of the following criteria have been met: a valid customer order with a fixed price has been received; a delivery appointment with the customer has been made; the product has been shipped in accordance with the delivery appointment within the required lead time; there is no further significant obligation to assist in the resale of the product; and collectibility is reasonably assured.</FONT></P></td></tr>

        Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;</i> (&#147;SFAS No. 133&#148;).
        Subsequently, the FASB issued Statement No. 137, <i>&#147;Accounting for
        Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#151;Deferral of the Effective
        Date of FASB Statement No. 133, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133&#148;</i>
        and Statement No. 138, <i>&#147;Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments
        and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.&#148;</i>
        SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards
        requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance
        sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS
        No. 133, as amended, requires that changes in the derivative&#146;s fair
        value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting
        criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative&#146;s
        gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income
        statement, to the extent effective, and requires that a company must formally
        document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that
        receive hedge accounting.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. All derivative instruments currently utilized by the Corporation, including commodities futures contracts, are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.</FONT></P>

Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities and production lines are capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized over the assets&#146; estimated useful lives.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, <i>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#148;</i> If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.</FONT></P></td></tr>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation
        adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, <i>&#147;Business
        Combinations&#148;</i> (&#147;SFAS No. 141&#148;) as of July 1, 2001,
        and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, <i>&#147;Goodwill
        and Other Intangible Assets&#148;</i> (&#147;SFAS No. 142&#148;) as of
        January 1, 2002. Through December 31, 2001, goodwill resulting from business
        acquisitions was amortized over 40 years. The reassessment of the useful
        lives of intangible assets acquired on or before June 30, 2001 was completed
        during the first quarter of 2002. Amortization of goodwill resulting from
        business acquisitions of $388.7 million was discontinued as of January
        1, 2002. Other intangible assets totaling $40.4 million as of January
        1, 2002 primarily consisted of trademarks and patents obtained through
        business acquisitions. The useful lives of trademarks were determined
        to be indefinite and, therefore, amortization of these assets was discontinued
        as of January 1, 2002. Patents valued at a total of $9.0 million are being
        amortized over their remaining legal lives of approximately eighteen years.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The impairment
        evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually using a two-step process.
        In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with
        the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated
        fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis
        of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting
        unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second
        step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill
        impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair
        value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill is determined by allocating
        the reporting unit&#146;s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities
        other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets) in
        a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied
        fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second
        step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment
        charge is recorded for the difference.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The evaluation of the carrying amount of other intangible assets with indefinite lives is made annually by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the other intangible assets with indefinite lives, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and other intangible assets and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Goodwill was assigned to reporting units and transitional impairment tests were performed for goodwill and other intangible assets during the first quarter of 2002 and the annual impairment tests were performed in the fourth quarter of 2002.

The consolidation of these entities will result in an increase to property, plant and equipment of approximately $120.0 million, with a corresponding increase to long-term debt and minority interest.

The major components of the plan were completed during 2002.

Components of the net $27.6 million pre-tax charge included a $28.8 million charge for pension settlement losses resulting from the voluntary work force reduction program (&#147;VWRP&#148;), a $3.0 million charge for pension curtailment losses and special termination benefits resulting from manufacturing plant closures, a $.1 million charge relating to involuntary termination benefits and a $.1 million charge relating to the realignment of the domestic sales organization, partially offset by a $4.4 million favorable adjustment reflecting higher than estimated proceeds from the sale of certain assets.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">These initiatives are expected to generate $75 million to $80 million of annual savings when fully implemented and contributed savings of approximately $38.0 million in 2002.

Total costs associated with the business realignment initiatives were $312.4 million compared to the $310.0 million announced in January 2002.

During 2002, cash payments totaling $2.7 million for equipment removal relating to outsourcing the manufacture of certain ingredients were recorded against the liability for business realignment initiatives. The 2001 charge to cost of sales of $50.1 million was a result of decisions to outsource the manufacture of certain ingredients and to significantly reduce the inventory levels of certain raw materials, primarily cocoa beans and cocoa butter. Also included in the charge was the impact of a decision to reduce raw material inventory levels for almonds and peanuts. The Corporation sold raw material inventories and delayed raw material deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2001 pre-tax charge of $5.3 million, which was a component of the business realignment and asset impairments charge,

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">During 2002,

        a pre-tax charge of $.7 million relating to pension curtailment losses
        and special termination benefits resulting from the closure of a manufacturing
        plant, as described below, was credited to pension benefit liabilities.
        Also during 2002, cash payments totaling $6.4 million, primarily for maintenance
        of properties prior to sale, severance and broker termination fees associated
        with exiting certain businesses were recorded against the liability for
        business realignment initiatives. Employee terminations were primarily
        related to the sale of certain confectionery brands to Farley&#146;s &amp;
        Sathers that resulted in the closure of a manufacturing facility in New
        Brunswick, New Jersey which was being held for sale as of December 31,
        2002. During 2002, 142 employees were terminated and involuntary employee

        non-cash write-offs of $8.5 million associated with exiting the Corporation&#146;s
        aseptically packaged drink business and $.7 million for inventory were
        also recorded against the liability for business realignment initiatives.
        Proceeds of $12.0 million for the sale of certain confectionery brands
        to Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers exceeded the 2001 estimates which resulted
        in a $4.4 million favorable adjustment to the 2001 asset impairments charge
        for goodwill. Net sales associated with businesses sold or exited as part
        of the business realignment initiatives were approximately $11.6 million,

Utilization recorded against the liability in 2002 reflected cash payments totaling $25.7 million and non-cash write-offs of $9.9 million associated primarily with exiting certain businesses. The cash payments related primarily to severance payments associated with the enhanced mutual separation program and plant closures, outsourcing the manufacture of certain ingredients, VWRP administrative expenses, the realignment of the Corporation&#146;s sales organizations and other expenses associated with exiting certain businesses and maintaining properties prior to sale.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation
        has entered into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials.
        Purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase
        of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers to minimize the
        effect of future price fluctuations. Total obligations for each year are
        comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and
        unpriced contracts which have been valued using market prices as of December
        31, 2002. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts
        is variable as market prices change over future periods. However, the
        variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the Corporation&#146;s
        futures price cover for those periods. Accordingly, increases or decreases
        in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures
        contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of December
        31, 2002 and in future periods. These obligations are satisfied by taking
        delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished
        goods. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002,
        such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making
        payment for the specific commodities.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation
        has entered into three off-balance sheet arrangements for the leasing
        of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. These off-balance sheet
        arrangements enabled the Corporation to lease these facilities under more
        favorable terms than other leasing alternatives. The operating lease arrangements
        are with special purpose trusts (&#147;SPTs&#148;) whereby the Corporation
        leases warehouse and distribution facilities in Redlands, California;
        Atlanta, Georgia; and Hershey, Pennsylvania, as discussed below. The SPTs
        were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the
        facilities to the Corporation. The SPTs financed the acquisition of the
        facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent third-party
        financial institutions. The independent third-party financial institution
        which holds the equity certificates is the owner of the SPTs. The owner
        of the SPTs has made substantive residual equity capital investments in
        excess of 3% which will be at risk during the entire term of each lease.
        Accordingly, the Corporation is not permitted to consolidate the SPTs
        because all of the conditions for consolidation have not been met. Aside
        from the residual guarantees and instrument guarantees associated with
        the individual leasing arrangements, as discussed below, the Corporation
        has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of these entities.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In December 2000, the Corporation entered into an operating lease agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement contained an option for the Corporation to purchase the facility. In January 2002, the Corporation assigned its right to purchase the facility to an SPT that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the Corporation under a new operating lease agreement. The lease term is five years, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1 million.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In October 2000, the Corporation entered into an operating lease agreement with an SPT for the leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility near Atlanta, Georgia.

The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $18.2 million.</FONT></P>

Under the agreement, the lessor paid construction costs totaling $61.7 million. The lease term is six years, including the one-year construction period, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">There are no penalties or other disincentives under the lease agreements if the Corporation decides not to renew any of the three leases.

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">If the Corporation
        were to exercise its options to purchase the three facilities at original
        cost at the end of the respective initial lease terms, the Corporation
        could purchase the facilities for a total of approximately $120.0 million,
        $79.9 million for the Pennsylvania and Georgia facilities in 2005, and
        $40.1 million for the California facility in 2007. If the Corporation
        chooses not to renew the leases or purchase the assets at the end of the
        lease terms, the Corporation is obligated under the residual guarantees
        for approximately $103.2 million in total for the three leases. Additionally,
        the Corporation is obligated to re-market each property on the lessor&#146;s
        behalf and, upon sale, distribute a portion of the proceeds to the note
        holders and certificate holders up to an amount equal to the remaining
        debt and equity certificates and to pay closing costs. If the Corporation
        chooses not to renew or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms,
        the Corporation does not anticipate a material disruption to operations,
        since such facilities are not unique, facilities with similar racking
        and storage capabilities are available in each of the areas where the
        facilities are located, there are no significant leasehold improvements
        that would be impaired, there would be no adverse tax consequences, the

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation
        utilizes certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including
        interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and commodities
        futures contracts, to manage variability in cash flows associated with
        interest rate, currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk
        exposures. The interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are
        entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures
        and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. Commodities
        futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are intended
        to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with
        anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation
        costs. If it is probable that hedged forecasted transactions will not
        occur either by the end of the originally specified time period or within
        an additional two-month period of time, derivative gains and losses reported
        in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance
        Sheets are immediately reclassified into earnings. Gains and losses on
        terminated derivatives designated as hedges are accounted for as part
        of the originally hedged transaction. Gains and losses on derivatives
        designated as hedges of items that mature or are sold or terminated, are
        recognized in income in the same period as the originally hedged transaction
        was anticipated to affect earnings. The Corporation utilizes derivative
        instruments as cash flow hedges and does not hold or issue derivative
        instruments for trading purposes. In entering into these contracts, the
        Corporation has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability
        of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Corporation
        does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In order
        to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure,
        the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.
        In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements
        that effectively converted variable-interest-rate rental payments on certain
        operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate. Rental payments on operating
        leases associated with the financing of construction of a warehouse and
        distribution facility near Hershey, Pennsylvania for $61.7 million and
        the financing of the purchase of a warehouse and distribution facility
        near Atlanta, Georgia for $18.2 million are variable based on the London
        Interbank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;). Such variable operating lease
        rental payments are forecasted transactions as defined by SFAS No. 133,
        as amended. The interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the
        variable-interest-rate rental payments on the operating leases from LIBOR
        to a fixed rate of 6.1%. Future changes in LIBOR are offset by changes
        in the value of the interest rate swap agreements, resulting in expense
        recognized in cost of sales at the fixed rate of 6.1%. The interest rate
        swap agreements qualify as cash flow hedges and the notional amounts,
        interest rates and terms of the swap agreements are consistent with the
        underlying operating lease agreements they are intended to hedge and,
        therefore, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Gains and losses on the
        interest rate swap agreements are included in other comprehensive income
        and are recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged rental
        payments affect earnings.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of $7.1 million and $2.7 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and was determined based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swap agreements was included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other long-term liabilities, with the offset reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Cash flows from interest rate swap agreements are classified as net cash provided from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Corporation&#146;s risk related to the interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing market rates.</FONT></P></td></tr>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase equipment, certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies, and to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-domestic subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. Foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months.</FONT></P>

        forward contracts are intended to be and are effective as hedges of firm,
        identifiable, foreign currency commitments. Since there is a direct relationship
        between the foreign currency derivatives and the foreign currency denomination
        of the transactions, foreign currency derivatives are highly effective
        in hedging cash flows related to transactions denominated in the corresponding
        foreign currencies. These contracts meet the criteria for cash flow hedge
        accounting treatment and, accordingly, gains and losses are included in
        other comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales or selling,
        marketing and administrative expense in the same period that the hedged
        items affect earnings. In entering into these contracts the Corporation
        has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of
        counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Corporation does
        not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was estimated by obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was an asset of $3.1 million and a liability of $.3 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other current assets and accrued liabilities, respectively, with the offsets reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Cash flows from foreign exchange forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency price risks associated with the purchase of equipment are classified as net cash flows (used by) provided from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash flows from other foreign exchange forward contracts are classified as net cash provided from operating activities.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Corporation enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. Commodity price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. Commodities futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income and are recognized ratably in cost of sales in the same period that the hedged raw material manufacturing requirements are recorded in cost of sales.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In order to qualify as a hedge of commodity price risk, it must be demonstrated that the changes in fair value of the commodities futures contracts are highly effective in hedging price risks associated with commodity purchases for manufacturing requirements and with transportation costs. The assessment of hedge effectiveness for commodities futures is performed on a quarterly basis by calculating the change in switch values relative to open commodities futures contracts being held and the number of futures contracts needed to price raw material purchases for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs. Effectiveness is also monitored by tracking changes in basis differentials as discussed below. The prices of commodities futures contracts reflect delivery to the same locations where the Corporation takes delivery of the physical commodities and, therefore, there is no ineffectiveness resulting from
differences in

location between the derivative and the hedged item. Commodities futures contracts have been deemed to be highly effective in hedging price risks associated with corresponding raw material purchases for manufacturing requirements and transportation costs.</FONT></P>

        futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase
        contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts
        (unrealized gains and losses) are made on a daily basis and are included
        in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes,
        on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such cash transfers will be offset
        by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of
        raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs in the future.
        Cash flows from commodities futures contracts are classified as net cash
        provided from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash
        Flows. Futures contracts being held in excess of the amount required to
        fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as
        hedges of anticipated manufacturing requirements for each commodity. Physical
        commodity forward purchase contracts meet the SFAS No. 133 definition

        gains on cash flow hedging derivatives reflected in comprehensive income
        were $106.7 million for 2002. Net after-tax losses on cash flow hedging
        derivatives reflected in comprehensive income were $7.8 million for 2001.
        Net gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were primarily associated
        with commodities futures contracts. Reclassification adjustments from
        accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to income, for gains or
        losses on cash flow hedging derivatives, were reflected in cost of sales.
        Reclassification of gains of $17.9 million for 2002 and losses of $19.3
        million for 2001 were associated with commodities futures contracts. Gains
        on commodities futures contracts recognized in cost of sales as a result
        of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately $1.5 million and $1.7 million
        before tax for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
        No gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified
        from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income as a result
        of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged
        forecasted transaction would not occur. There were no components of gains
        or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income
        because such components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
        The amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign
        exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and commodities
        futures contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next
        twelve months was approximately $54.5 million and $6.2 million after tax

The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $868.8 million as of December 31, 2002, compared to a fair value of $1,005.9 million based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $877.9 million as of December 31, 2001, compared to a fair value of $957.8 million.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">As of December 31, 2002, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward contracts maturing in 2003 and 2004 to purchase $45.1 million in foreign currency, primarily British sterling and euros, and to sell $17.2 million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. As of December 31, 2002, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was an asset of $3.1 million. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was a liability of $.3 million. The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted variable-interest-rate rental payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%. The fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a liability of $7.1 million and $2.7 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</FONT></P></td></tr>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Generally, the Corporation&#146;s short-term borrowings are in the form of commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or less. As of December 31, 2002, the Corporation maintained short-term and long-term committed credit facilities with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $400 million which could be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper. The Corporation may increase the credit facilities to $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the banks. In November 2002, the short-term credit facility agreement was renewed with a credit limit of $200 million expiring in November 2003. The long-term committed credit facility agreement with a credit limit of $200 million will expire in November 2006. The credit facilities may be used to fund general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation also maintains lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various currencies up to approximately $21.0 million and $21.7 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, at the lending banks&#146; prime commercial interest rates or lower.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation had short-term foreign bank loans against its credit facilities and lines of credit of $11.1 million and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The amount of the Corporation&#146;s short-term borrowings peaked in December 2002 at $11.1 million. The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, were 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The credit facilities and lines of credit were supported by commitment fee arrangements. The average fee during 2002 was less than .2% per annum of the commitment. The Corporation&#146;s credit facility agreements contain a financial covenant which requires that a specified income to interest ratio be maintained. These agreements are also subject to other representations and covenants which do not materially restrict the Corporation&#146;s activities. The Corporation is in compliance with all covenants included in the credit facility agreements. There were no significant compensating balance agreements which legally restricted these funds.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">As a result of maintaining a consolidated cash management system, the Corporation maintains overdraft positions in certain accounts at several banks. The Corporation has the contractual right of offset for the accounts with overdrafts. Such overdrafts, which were reflected as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents, were $24.8 million and $26.5 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</FONT></P></td></tr>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In conjunction with the business realignment initiatives announced on October 24, 2001, the Corporation offered an early retirement program to approximately 10% of its work force in the fourth quarter of 2001. The early retirement program gave eligible salaried employees an opportunity to retire with enhanced benefits related to the Corporation&#146;s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. In general, eligible employees were born before January 1, 1954, and were hired before January 1, 1999. Pension benefits were enhanced by adding five additional years of age and service to eligible employees&#146; retirement accounts, along with certain supplemental benefits. Retiree medical benefits were enhanced by adding five additional years to age and service formulas used to determine retiree contributions.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In 2002, pension settlement and curtailment losses and special termination benefits totaled $33.0 million. This amount related primarily to the non-cash costs for pension settlements associated with departing employees electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefit under the early retirement program and for pension curtailments and special termination benefits associated with the closure of three manufacturing facilities as part of the business realignment initiatives.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The total pre-tax charge for the VWRP recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 was $148.7 million and was accrued based on actual employee acceptances. Improved pension benefits under the early retirement program of $109.1 million will be funded through payments from one of the Corporation&#146;s defined benefit pension plans. Enhanced retiree medical benefits of $30.8 million will be funded from operating cash flows. Additional costs for outplacement services and enhanced severance benefits under a voluntary mutual separation program of $8.8 million were funded from operating cash flows.</FONT></P>

The ESOP was funded by a 15-year, 7.75% loan of $47.9 million from the Corporation. During 2002 and 2001, the ESOP received a combination of dividends on unallocated shares and contributions from the Corporation equal to the amount required to meet its principal and interest payments under the loan. Simultaneously, the ESOP allocated to participants 159,176 shares of Common Stock each year. As of December 31, 2002, the ESOP held 1,060,575 allocated shares and 636,696 unallocated shares. All ESOP shares are considered outstanding for income per share computations.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation recognized net compensation expense equal to the shares allocated multiplied by the original cost of $20.06 per share less dividends received by the ESOP on unallocated shares. Compensation expense related to the ESOP for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $.9 million, $1.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $.9 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Dividends paid on all ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The unearned ESOP compensation balance in stockholders&#146; equity represented deferred compensation expense to be recognized by the Corporation in future years as additional shares are allocated to participants.</FONT></P></td></tr>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Class B Stock can be converted into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, a total of 11,500 shares, 8,050 shares and 2,050 shares, respectively, of Class B Stock were converted into Common Stock.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In December 2000, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement (&#147;Rights Agreement&#148;) and declared a dividend of one right (&#147;Right&#148;) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock is traded.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Rights become exercisable only upon (i) resolution of the Board of Directors after any person has commenced a tender offer that would result in such person becoming the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Common Stock, (ii) the Corporation&#146;s announcement that a person or group has acquired 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than 35% of the voting power of all of the outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock. When exercisable, each Right entitles its registered holder to purchase from the Corporation, at a pre-determined exercise price, one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (which would be convertible by holders of Class B Stock into Series B Participating Preferred Stock on the basis of one one-thousandths of a share of Series B Participating Preferred Stock for every share of
Class B Common Stock held at that time). Each one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock would have economic and voting terms similar to those of one share of Common Stock. Similarly, each one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Participating Preferred Stock would have economic and voting terms similar to those of one share of Class B Stock.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Upon the earlier of (a) a public announcement by the Corporation that a person or group has acquired 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or (b) such person or group acquiring more than 35% of the voting power of the Common Stock and Class B Stock, each Right (except those owned by the acquiring person or group) will automatically become a right to buy, at the pre-determined exercise price, that number of one one-thousandths of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. In addition, if the Corporation is acquired in a merger or other business combination, each Right will entitle a holder to purchase from the acquiring company, for the pre-determined exercise price, preferred stock of the acquiring company having an aggregate market value equal to twice the exercise price.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">Further, at any time after a person or group acquires 15% or more (but less than 50%) of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock or more than 35% of the voting power of all outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors may, at its option, exchange all (but not less than all) of the outstanding Preferred Stock (other than Rights held by the acquiring person or group)</FONT></P></td></tr>

The Incentive Plan also provides for the deferral of performance stock unit and restricted stock unit awards by participants.

Each option has a maximum term of ten years. Options granted under the Incentive Plan prior to December 31, 1999, vest at the end of the second year after grant. In 2000, the terms and conditions of the grant were changed to provide for pro-rated vesting over four years for options granted subsequent to December 31, 1999.

        the long-term portion of the Incentive Plan, each January the Corporation
        grants selected executives and other key employees performance stock units
        whose vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance
        objectives. If at the end of the applicable three-year performance cycle
        targets for financial measures are met, the full number of shares are
        awarded to the participants. The performance scores can range from 0%
        to 275% of the targeted amounts. Restricted stock units were awarded in
        2001 and 2002 under the long-term portion of the Incentive Plan to certain
        executive officers and were also awarded quarterly to non-employee directors
        of the Corporation as part of the Directors&#146; Compensation Plan. The
        compensation amount charged against income for performance and restricted
        stock units was $6.4 million, $6.6 million and $1.8 million for 2002,
        2001 and 2000, respectively. The compensation cost associated with the
        performance stock units is recognized ratably over the three-year term
        based on the year-end market value of the stock. The compensation cost
        associated with employee restricted stock units is recognized over a specified
        restriction period based on the year-end market value of the stock. The
        compensation cost associated with non-employee director restricted stock

The Corporation&#146;s four operating segments are comprised of geographic areas including the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the combination of the Corporation&#146;s other international operations. For purposes of segment reporting, the Corporation&#146;s North American operations, the United States, Canada and Mexico, have been aggregated in accordance with the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, <i>&#147;Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.&#148;</i> The North American operations were aggregated on the basis of their similar economic characteristics and the similarity of their products and services, production processes, types or classes of customers for their products and services, methods used to distribute products,
and the nature of the regulatory environments. The Corporation&#146;s other international operations were aggregated with its North American operations to form one reportable segment, since the other international operations combined share most of the aggregation criteria and represent less than 10% of consolidated revenues, operating profits and assets. Consolidated net sales represented primarily sales of confectionery products.</FONT></P>

The Corporation believes that the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States appropriate under the circumstances to reflect in all material respects the substance of applicable events and transactions. In preparing the financial statements, it is necessary that management make informed estimates and judgments. The other financial information in this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable for purposes of preparing financial statements and that assets are properly accounted for and safeguarded. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost of the system must be related to the benefits to be derived. The Corporation believes its system provides an appropriate balance in this regard. The Corporation maintains an Internal Audit Department which reviews the adequacy and tests the application of internal accounting controls.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The 2002 financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent auditors, whose appointment was approved by the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors on May 10, 2002, following dismissal on April 30, 2002 of Arthur Andersen LLP, the Corporation&#146;s former independent auditors. KPMG LLP&#146;s report expresses an opinion that the Corporation&#146;s 2002 financial statements are fairly stated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and their report states that their audit was performed in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States which are designed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, consisting solely of non-management directors, meets regularly with the independent auditors, internal auditors and management to discuss, among other things, the audit scopes and results.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hershey Foods Corporation and subsidiaries (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) as of December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders&#146; equity for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hershey Foods Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders&#146; equity for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, before the revisions described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their
report dated January 22, 2002.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hershey Foods Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">As discussed above, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hershey Foods Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders&#146; equity for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Notes 1 and 5, these financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, <i>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</i>, which was adopted by the Corporation as of January 1, 2002. As described in Note 1, these financial statements have been revised to reflect reclassifications of certain consumer and trade promotional expenses as required by Emerging Issues Task Force No. 01-9, <i>Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or Reseller of the Vendor&#146;s Products.</i> In our opinion, the
disclosures and reclassifications for 2001 and 2000 as described in Notes 1 and 5 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the Hershey Foods Corporation other than with respect to such disclosures and reclassifications and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.</FONT></P>

        OF PREDECESSOR AUDITOR (ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP)</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">The following report is a copy of a report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP and has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP. As discussed in Note 1, in 2002, the Corporation adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-9, <i>&#147;Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer&#148;</i> which requires reclassification of certain consumer and trade promotional expenses in the 2001 and 2000 consolidated income statements. Also, in 2002, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, <i>&#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148;</i> (SFAS No. 142). Included in Notes 1 and 5 are transitional disclosures for 2001 and 2000 that are required by SFAS No. 142. The Arthur Andersen LLP report does not extend to these changes in the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements. The adjustments to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements were reported on by
KPMG LLP as stated in their report appearing herein.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hershey Foods Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders&#146; equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, appearing on pages A-16 through A-43. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE="2">In our opinion,
        the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
        respects, the financial position of Hershey Foods Corporation and subsidiaries
        as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
        and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
        31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
        the United States.</FONT></P>
