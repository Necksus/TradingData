<DESCRIPTION>KEY EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN
<TEXT>



                                                                   Exhibit 10.1


                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                           KEY EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN



1.   ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

     Hershey Foods Corporation (the  "Corporation")  hereby  establishes the Key
     Employee Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to provide
     to selected  key  employees of the  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  (as
     defined  below),  upon whose efforts the  Corporation  is dependent for the
     successful  conduct of its  business,  further  incentive  to continue  and
     increase  their  efforts  as  employees  and to remain in the employ of the
     Corporation and its subsidiaries.

     The Plan  continues  the Annual  Incentive  Program  ("AIP"),  with certain
     modifications,  as in effect under the Corporation's  Management  Incentive
     Plan ("MIP")  established  in 1975 and as amended  thereafter,  pursuant to
     which participants are entitled to receive cash awards based on achievement
     of  performance  goals  during  annual  performance  cycles.  The Plan also
     continues the Long-Term  Incentive Program ("LTIP") portion of the MIP with
     certain modifications. In addition to performance stock units ("Performance
     Stock  Units"),  the LTIP  portion  now also  includes  nonqualified  stock
     options for the purchase of Common Stock  ("Options");  stock  appreciation
     rights ("SARs"); and restricted stock units ("Restricted Stock Units").

     As used  herein,  (i) the  term  "Subsidiary  Corporation"  shall  mean any
     present  or  future   corporation  which  is  or  would  be  a  "subsidiary
     corporation"  of the  Corporation as defined in Section 424 of the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and (ii) the term "Corporation"  defined
     above  shall  refer  collectively  to  Hershey  Foods  Corporation  and its
     Subsidiary Corporations unless the context indicates otherwise.

2.   STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

     The aggregate number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $1.00 Par
     Value (the  "Common  Stock"),  which may be covered  by  Performance  Stock
     Units,  Options,  SARs and Restricted  Stock Units granted  pursuant to the
     LTIP portion of the Plan will be  established by the Board of Directors and
     will be subject to  adjustment  in  accordance  with Section 12 below.  The
     shares issued under this Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares,
     treasury  shares  held  by  the  Corporation  or  any  direct  or  indirect
     subsidiary  thereof or shares  acquired  by the  Corporation  through  open
     market  purchases  (whether made before or after any exercise of Options(s)
     or the granting of stock compensation  hereunder) or otherwise. In addition
     to shares of Common Stock actually  issued or  distributed  under the Plan,
     there shall be deemed to have been  issued a number of shares  equal to (i)
     the number of shares of Common Stock in respect of which optionees  utilize
     the manner of  exercise  of,  and  payment  for,  Options  as  provided  in
     Paragraph  7II(g)  of this  Plan,  and

                                       1
<PAGE>


     (ii) the  number of shares of Common
     Stock which is  equivalent  in value to any cash amounts  distributed  upon
     payment of Performance  Stock Units,  SARs or Restricted  Stock Units.  For
     purposes of  determining  the charge to be made  pursuant  to subpart  (ii)
     against  the shares of Common  Stock  subject  to the Plan,  the value of a
     share of  Common  Stock  shall  be its Fair  Market  Value  as  defined  in
     Paragraph 4 when awards are made with respect to  Performance  Stock Units,
     upon exercise of SARs, and upon  expiration of the  applicable  restriction
     period of  Restricted  Stock Units.  Any shares  subject  under the Plan to
     Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units which, for
     any reason, expire or terminate or are forfeited or surrendered shall again
     be available for issuance under the Plan.

3.   ADMINISTRATION

     The  Plan  shall  be  administered  by  the   Compensation   and  Executive
     Organization  Committee  (the  "Committee"),  or any  successor  committee,
     appointed  by and  consisting  solely of members of the Board of  Directors
     (the  "Board")  of the  Corporation,  each  of  whom  qualifies  as  both a
     "nonemployee  director"  within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 or its  successor
     under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 (the  "Exchange  Act") and an
     "outside  director"  within  the  meaning  of  Section  162(m) of the Code.
     Committee  members shall not be eligible to  participate  in the Plan.  The
     Board may from time to time remove and appoint  members of the Committee in
     substitution for, or in addition to, members  previously  appointed and may
     fill vacancies,  however caused, in the Committee.  The Committee may adopt
     such rules and regulations as it deems useful in governing its affairs. Any
     action of the  Committee  with  respect to the  administration  of the Plan
     shall be taken by majority vote at a Committee  meeting or written  consent
     of all Committee members.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,  the Committee  shall have
     authority:  (i) to construe and interpret Plan  provisions;  (ii) to define
     the terms used in the Plan; (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
     regulations  relating to the Plan; (iv) to select  particular  employees to
     participate in the Plan, (v) to determine the terms,  conditions,  form and
     amount of  grants,  distributions  or  payments  made to each  participant,
     including  conditions  upon  and  provisions  for  vesting,   exercise  and
     acceleration  of any  grants,  distributions  or  payments;  (vi)  upon the
     request of a participant in the Plan, to approve and determine the duration
     of leaves  of  absence  which may be  granted  to the  participant  without
     constituting  a termination  of his or her  employment  for purposes of the
     Plan; and (vii) to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for
     the  administration and operation of the Plan. The Committee shall have the
     right to impose varying terms and conditions  with respect to each grant or
     award. All determinations and  interpretations  made by the Committee shall
     be final,  binding and  conclusive on all  participants  and on their legal
     representatives and beneficiaries.

4.   FAIR MARKET VALUE

     As used in the Plan (unless a different  method of  calculation is required
     by  applicable  law, and except as otherwise  specifically  provided in any
     Plan  provision),  "Fair Market  Value" on or as of any date shall mean (i)
     the  closing  price of the Common  Stock as  reported in the New

                                       2
<PAGE>


     York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Report (or any other
     consolidated transactions reporting system which subsequently may replace
     such Composite Transactions Report) for the New York Stock Exchange trading
     day immediately preceding such date, or if there are no sales on such date,
     on the next preceding day on which there were sales, or (ii) in the event
     that the Common Stock is no longer listed for trading on the New York Stock
     Exchange, an amount determined in accordance with standards adopted by the
     Committee.

5.   ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

     Key employees of the Corporation or of any of its Subsidiary  Corporations,
     including  officers and directors who are regular employees but not members
     of the Committee,  who in the opinion of the Committee are in a position to
     contribute   significantly  to  the  success  of  the  Corporation  or  any
     Subsidiary  Corporation,  division  or  operating  unit  thereof,  shall be
     eligible for selection to participate in the Plan. In making this selection
     and in  determining  the form  and  amount  of  grants,  distributions  and
     payments under the Plan,  the Committee  shall take into account the duties
     of the respective employees,  their present and potential  contributions to
     the success of the Corporation or any Subsidiary  Corporation,  division or
     operating  unit  thereof,  and such other factors as the Committee may deem
     relevant in  connection  with  accomplishing  the purposes of the Plan.  An
     employee  who  has  been  selected  to  participate  may,  if he or  she is
     otherwise eligible,  receive more than one grant from time to time, and may
     be granted any  combination  of  contingent  target grants under the AIP or
     under the LTIP components of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine.

6.   ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM

     The Committee may from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the Plan
     and such  other  terms  and  conditions  as the  Committee  may  determine,
     establish  contingent target grants for those eligible employees it selects
     to participate in the AIP. Each such contingent  grant may be, but need not
     be, evidenced by a written instrument,  and shall be determined in relation
     to the  participant's  level of  responsibility  in the Corporation and the
     competitive  compensation  practices  of other major  businesses,  and such
     other factors as are deemed appropriate by the Committee.

     (a) Awards actually earned by and paid to AIP  participants  ("AIP Awards")
         will be based  primarily upon  achievement of performance  goals over a
         one-year performance cycle as approved by the Committee.

     (b) The Committee, within the limits of the Plan, shall have full authority
         and  discretion  to  determine  the  time  or  times  of   establishing
         contingent  target  grants;  to select  from among those  eligible  the
         employees to receive  awards;  to review and certify the achievement of
         performance  goals;  to  designate  levels  of  awards  to be earned in
         relation to levels of achievement of performance  goals;  to adopt such
         financial  and  nonfinancial  performance  or  other  criteria  for the
         payment  of  awards  as it may  determine  from  time to time;  to make
         awards;  and to  establish  such other  measures as may be necessary to
         achieve the  objectives  of the Plan.  The  financial or  non-financial
         performance goals established by the Committee may be based upon one or
         more of the following: earnings per share, return on net assets, market

                                       3
<PAGE>




         share,  control of costs, net sales,  cash flow,  economic  value-added
         measures, sales growth, earnings growth, stock price, return on equity,
         improvements in financial ratings,  regulatory compliance,  achievement
         of balance sheet or income statement objectives, or any other objective
         goals established by the Committee (the "Performance Factors").

     (c) Aggregate  annual AIP Awards  shall not exceed six (6%)  percent of the
         excess of Before-Tax  Income  (defined for these purposes as Net Income
         plus  provision for Federal,  state and local income taxes and interest
         expense on long-term debt, but after  consideration  of the cost of the
         Plan) over sixteen (16%) percent of Total Invested Capital (defined for
         these  purposes  as  Stockholders'  Equity  plus  Long-Term  Debt  plus
         Deferred Income Taxes) determined as the average of such Total Invested
         Capital  at the  beginning  of the  year  and the end of each  calendar
         quarter of such year. The maximum amount any participant can receive as
         an AIP Award for any calendar year shall not exceed $2,100,000.

     (d) AIP Awards as earned  under the terms of the Plan shall be paid in cash
         and may exceed or be less than the contingent  target grants,  provided
         that  payments  do not exceed  the  maximum  permitted  cost of the AIP
         calculated  pursuant to subparagraph (c) above.  Payment shall normally
         be made as soon as  possible  following  the  close  of the  year,  but
         payment of all or any portion may be deferred by participants  with the
         approval of the Committee.

7.   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM

     The LTIP consists of the following four components:

     I.  PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS

         The Committee may, subject to the provisions of the Plan and such other
         terms and conditions as the Committee may determine,  grant Performance
         Stock  Units  to  reflect  the  value  of   contingent   target  grants
         established for each eligible employee selected for participation. Each
         grant of Performance  Stock Units may be, but need not be, evidenced by
         a written instrument. Such contingent target grants shall be determined
         in  relation  to  the  employee's  level  of   responsibility   in  the
         Corporation or any Subsidiary  Corporation,  division or operating unit
         thereof,  and the  competitive  compensation  practices  of other major
         businesses.

         (a)  Awards actually earned by and paid to holders of Performance Stock
              Units ("PSU Awards") will be based upon achievement of performance
              goals over performance  cycles as approved by the Committee.  Such
              performance  cycles  each  shall  cover such  period of time,  not
              exceeding  five years,  as the  Committee  from time to time shall
              determine.

         (b)  The  Committee,  within  the  limits of the Plan,  shall have full
              authority  and  discretion  to  determine  the  time or  times  of
              establishing   contingent   target  grants  and  the  granting  of

                                       4

              Performance  Stock Units;  to select from among those eligible the
              employees  to  receive  PSU  Awards;  to review  and  certify  the
              achievement of performance goals; to designate levels of awards to
              be earned in  relation  to levels of  achievement  of  performance
              goals;  to adopt such  financial and  nonfinancial  performance or
              other  criteria for the payment of PSU Awards as it may  determine
              from time to time;  to make awards;  and to  establish  such other
              measures as may be necessary to the  objectives  of the Plan.  The
              performance goals established by the Committee may be based on one
              or more of the Performance Factors.

         (c)  Payments of PSU Awards  shall be made in shares of Common Stock or
              partly  in cash as the  Committee  in its  sole  discretion  shall
              determine and shall be charged against the shares  available under
              the LTIP portion of the Plan as provided in Paragraph 2; provided,
              however,  that no  fractional  shares shall be issued and any such
              fraction will be  eliminated  by rounding  downward to the nearest
              whole share. In any case in which actual payment of a PSU Award is
              deferred as  provided  below,  a charge  will be made  against the
              available shares for the number of shares equivalent to the dollar
              amount of the deferred PSU Award.

         (d)  PSU Awards as earned  under the terms of the Plan may exceed or be
              less than the contingent target grants.  Payment shall normally be
              made as soon as  possible  following  the close of the  year,  but
              payment of all or any portion may be deferred by participants with
              the approval of the Committee.

         (e) The maximum amount a participant  can receive as a PSU Award in any
             calendar year is $2,430,000.

     II. STOCK OPTIONS

         The Committee may, from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the
         Plan and such other terms and  conditions  as it may  determine,  grant
         nonqualified  Options  to  purchase  shares  of  Common  Stock  of  the
         Corporation  to employees  eligible to  participate  in the Plan.  Each
         grant of an Option shall be on such terms and conditions and be in such
         form as the  Committee  may from time to time  approve,  subject to the
         following:

         (a)  The exercise  price per share with respect to each Option shall be
              determined by the Committee in its sole discretion,  but shall not
              be less than 100% of the Fair Market  Value of the Common Stock as
              of the date of the grant of the Option.

         (b)  Options  granted  under  the Plan  shall be  exercisable,  in such
              installments  and for such  periods,  as shall be  provided by the
              Committee  at the  time of  granting,  but in no event  shall  any
              Option granted extend for a period in excess of ten years from the
              date of grant.

         (c)  The maximum  number of shares of Common  Stock  covered by Options
              granted to a  participant  for any calendar  year shall not exceed
              250,000.

              deemed  appropriate,  are  those  relating  to (i) the  period  or
              periods and the conditions of exercisability  of any Option;  (ii)
              the minimum  periods  during  which  grantees  of Options  must be
              employed, or must hold Options before they may be exercised; (iii)
              the minimum  periods  during which shares  acquired  upon exercise
              must be held  before  sale or transfer  shall be  permitted;  (iv)
              conditions  under  which such  Options or shares may be subject to
              forfeiture;  and (v) the  frequency  of exercise or the minimum or
              maximum number of shares that may be acquired at any one time.

         (e)  Exercise  of an Option  shall be by  written  notice  stating  the
              election  to  exercise  in the form and manner  determined  by the
              Committee.

         (f)  The  purchase  price upon  exercise of any Option shall be paid in
              full by making  payment  (i) in cash;  (ii) in whole or in part by
              the delivery of a certificate or  certificates of shares of Common
              Stock of the Corporation, valued at its then Fair Market Value; or
              (iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii).

         (g)  Notwithstanding  subparagraph  (e) above,  any  optionee  may make
              payment of the Option price through a simultaneous exercise of his
              or her Option and sale of the shares thereby acquired  pursuant to
              a brokerage  arrangement  approved in advance by the  Committee to
              assure its conformity with the terms and conditions of the Plan.

         (h)  The Committee may require the surrender of outstanding Options as
              a condition to the grant of new Options.

         (i)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of the Plan or of any Option
              agreement  between  the  Corporation  and an  employee,  upon  the
              occurrence of a Change in Control, each outstanding Option held by
              a  participant  who  is an  employee  of  the  Corporation  or any
              Subsidiary  Corporation  or  who  retired  while  employed  by the
              Corporation  or any  Subsidiary  Corporation  shall  become  fully
              vested and  exercisable  notwithstanding  any vesting  schedule or
              installment schedule relating to the exercisability of such Option
              contained  in  the  applicable   Option   agreement  or  otherwise
              established at the time of grant of the Option.

         (j)  For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" means:

              (1) Individuals  who, on June 8, 1999,  constitute  the Board (the

                  least a  majority  of the  Board,  provided  that  any  person
                  becoming a director subsequent to June 8, 1999, whose election
                  or nomination  for election was approved by a vote of at least
                  two-thirds  of the  Incumbent  Directors  then  on  the  Board
                  (either by specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement
                  of the  Corporation  in which such  person is named as nominee

                  solicitation  of  proxies or  consents  by or on behalf of any
                  person  (as such term is  defined  in  Section  3(a)(9) of the
                  Exchange  Act and as used in Section  13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of

                  Contest"),  including by reason of any  agreement  intended to
                  avoid or settle any Election  Contest or Proxy Contest,  shall

                  Corporation  entitled  to vote  generally  in the  election of
                  directors (the "Outstanding  Corporation  Voting Power") shall
                  be deemed to be an Incumbent Director; or

              (2) The  acquisition  or  holding  by  any  Person  of  beneficial
                  ownership  (within  the  meaning  of Section  13(d)  under the
                  Exchange  Act  and  the  rules  and  regulations   promulgated
                  thereunder)  of shares of the Common  Stock and/or the Class B
                  Common Stock of the  Corporation  representing  25% or more of
                  either (i) the total number of then outstanding shares of both

                  Stock  of the  Corporation  by any of the  following  entities
                  shall  not by  itself  constitute  such a  Change  in  Control

              approval.

     III.STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

         The Committee may, from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the
         Plan  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Committee  may
         determine, grant SARs to employees eligible to participate in the Plan.
         SARs may, but need not be  evidenced  by an  agreement  executed by the
         Corporation  and the  holder,  and shall be  subject  to such terms and
         conditions  consistent with the Plan as the Committee shall impose from
         time to time, including the following:

         (a)  SARs may, but need not,  relate to Options granted under the Plan,
              as the Committee  shall  determine  from time to time. In no event
              shall any SARs granted  extend for a period in excess of ten years
              from the date of grant.

         (b)  A holder shall  exercise his or her SARs by giving  written notice
              of  such  exercise  in  the  form  and  manner  determined  by the
              Committee, and the date upon which such written notice is received
              by the Corporation shall be the exercise date for the SARs.

         (c)  A holder of SARs shall be entitled to receive  upon  exercise  the
              excess of the Fair Market  Value of a share of Common Stock at the
              time of exercise over the Fair Market Value of a share at the time
              the SARs were  granted,  multiplied  by the number of shares  with
              respect to which the SARs relate.

         (d)  In the sole discretion of the Committee, the amount payable to the
              holder upon exercise of SARs may be paid either in Common Stock or
              in cash or in a combination  thereof. To the extent paid in Common
              Stock,  the value of the Common  Stock  that shall be  distributed
              shall be the Fair  Market  Value of a share of Common  Stock  upon
              exercise  of the  SARs  as  provided  in  Paragraph  2;  provided,
              however,  that no  fractional  shares shall be issued and any such
              fraction will be  eliminated  by rounding  downward to the nearest
              whole share.

         (e)  In the sole discretion of the Committee,  SARs related to specific
              Options may be exercisable only upon surrender of all or a portion
              of the related Option, or may be exercisable, in whole or in part,
              only at such times and to the extent  that the  related  Option is
              exercisable,  and the number of shares purchasable pursuant to the
              related  Option  may be  reduced  to the  extent of the  number of
              shares with respect to which the SARs are exercised.

         (f)  In lieu of  receiving  payment  at the time of  exercise  of SARs,
              payment of all or any portion  may be deferred by the  participant
              with the approval of the Committee.


                                       9

         (g) The  maximum  number of SARs  granted to a  participant  during any
             calendar year shall not exceed 250,000.

     IV. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

         The Committee may, from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the
         Plan and such other terms and  conditions  as it may  determine,  grant
         Restricted  Stock Units to  employees  eligible to  participate  in the
         Plan.  Each  grant of  Restricted  Stock  Units may be, but need not be
         evidenced by a written instrument.  The grant of Restricted Stock Units
         shall state the number of Restricted  Stock Units covered by the grant,
         and shall contain such terms and  conditions and be in such form as the
         Committee may from time to time approve, subject to the following:

         (a) Each Restricted  Stock Unit shall be equivalent in value to a share
of Common Stock.

         (b)  Vesting of each grant of Restricted  Stock Units shall require the
              holder  to  remain  in  the  employment  of the  Corporation  or a
              Subsidiary  Corporation  for a prescribed  period (a  "Restriction
              Period").  The Committee shall determine the Restriction Period or
              Periods which shall apply to the shares of Common Stock covered by
              each  grant  of  Restricted  Stock  Units.   Except  as  otherwise
              determined by the Committee and provided in the written instrument
              granting  the  Restricted  Stock  Units,  and except as  otherwise
              provided in Paragraph 8, all  Restricted  Stock Units granted to a
              participant under the Plan shall terminate upon termination of the
              participant's  employment  with the  Corporation or any Subsidiary
              Corporation  before the end of the  Restriction  Period or Periods
              applicable to such Restricted  Stock Units,  and in such event the
              holder  shall not be entitled to receive any payment  with respect
              to those  Restricted  Stock Units.  The Committee may also, in its
              sole  discretion,  establish  other terms and  conditions  for the
              vesting of Restricted Stock Units,  including conditioning vesting
              on the  achievement  of one or  more of the  Performance  Factors.
              Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or of any written
              instrument granting Restricted Stock Units, upon the occurrence of
              a Change in Control as defined in  subparagraph  (j) of  Paragraph
              7II hereof,  all  restrictions on Restricted Stock Units held by a
              participant   who  is  an  employee  of  the  Corporation  or  any
              Subsidiary Corporation shall lapse.

         (c)  Upon expiration of the Restriction Period or Periods applicable to
              each grant of Restricted  Stock Units,  the holder shall,  without
              payment on his part,  be entitled to receive  payment in an amount
              equal to the  aggregate  Fair Market Value of the shares of Common
              Stock covered by such grant upon such expiration. Such payment may
              be made in cash,  in shares of Common Stock equal to the number of
              Restricted Stock Units with respect to which such payment is made,
              or in any  combination  thereof,  as  the  Committee  in its  sole
              discretion shall  determine.  Any payment in cash shall reduce the
              number  of  shares of  Common  Stock  available  under the Plan as
              provided in Paragraph 2, to the extent of the number of Restricted
              Stock  Units to which  such  payment  relates.  Further  upon such
              expiration, the holder shall be entitled to receive a cash payment
              in an amount  equal to each cash  dividend the  Corporation  would

                                       10
<PAGE>


              have paid to such holder during the term of those Restricted Stock
              Units as if the  holder had been the owner of record of the shares
              of Common  Stock  covered by such  Restricted  Stock  Units on the
              record date for the payment of such dividend.

         (d)  In lieu of  receiving  payment  at the time of  expiration  of the
              Restriction  Period or Periods,  payment of all or any portion may
              be deferred by the participant with the approval of the Committee.


         (e)  The  maximum  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  as  to  which
              Restricted  Stock  Units may be granted to a  participant  for any
              calendar year shall not exceed 50,000.

8.   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     Upon  termination of employment  with the  Corporation of any  participant,
     such  participant's  rights with respect to any  contingent  target  grants
     under the AIP, or any Performance Stock Units,  Options, SARs or Restricted
     Stock Units granted under the LTIP, shall be as follows:

     (a) In the event that the  participant  is  terminated or discharged by the
         Corporation  for  any  reason,  except  as and to the  extent  provided
         otherwise by the  Committee in writing,  the  participant's  rights and
         interests  under the Plan shall  immediately  terminate  upon notice of
         termination of employment. Upon the occurrence of a Potential Change in
         Control (as defined in  subparagraph  (k) of Paragraph  7II hereof) and
         for a period  of one year  thereafter,  and  upon the  occurrence  of a
         Change in Control  (as defined in  subparagraph  (j) of  Paragraph  7II
         hereof), the following special provisions and notice requirements shall
         be applicable in the event of the  termination of the employment of any
         participant  holding  an Option  under the Plan:  (i) in no event may a
         notice of  termination  of  employment  be issued to such a participant
         unless at least ten (10) business  days prior to the effective  date of
         such  termination  the participant is provided with a written notice of
         intent to terminate the  participant's  employment  which sets forth in
         reasonable detail the reason for such intent to terminate,  the date on
         which such  termination  is to be effective,  and a description  of the
         participant's  rights under this Plan and under the agreements granting
         such Option or Options,  including  the fact that no such Option may be
         exercised after such  termination has become  effective and the manner,
         extent and price at which all Options then held by such participant may
         be   exercised;   and  (ii)  such  notice  of  intent  to  terminate  a
         participant's   employment   shall  not  be  considered  a  "notice  of
         termination of  employment"  for purposes of the first sentence of this
         Paragraph 8 (a). This Paragraph 8 (a) is intended only to provide for a
         requirement  of notice to terminate  upon the  occurrence of the events
         set forth herein and shall not be construed to create an  obligation of
         continued  employment  or a contract of  employment in any manner or to
         otherwise  affect or limit the  Corporation's  ability to terminate the
         employment of any participant holding an Option under the Plan.

     (b) If a participant  terminates  employment  with the  Corporation  as the
         result,  in the sole judgment of the Committee,  of his or her becoming
         totally disabled (in which event termination will be deemed to occur on
         the date the Committee makes such  determination),  or if a participant
         should  die or (except  as to  Restricted  Stock  Units)  retire  while

                                       11
<PAGE>



         employed by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiary Corporations, then
         the  participant  or, as the case may be, the person or persons to whom
         the participant's  interest under the Plan shall pass by will or by the
         laws of  descent  and  distribution  (the  "Estate"),  shall  have  the
         following rights:

         (i)  the  grantee  of a  contingent  AIP grant or the  Estate  shall be
              entitled to receive payment of an AIP award as, and to the extent,
              determined by the Committee;

         (ii) if the holder of Performance  Stock Units shall have been employed
              for at least two-thirds of the related  performance cycle prior to
              the date of  termination  or  death,  then,  except  as  otherwise
              provided  in  the  written  instrument  (if  any)  evidencing  the
              Performance  Stock Units,  and subject to any further  adjustments
              the Committee may make in its absolute discretion, the participant
              or the Estate shall be entitled to receive  payment of a PSU Award
              upon the  expiration of the related  performance  cycle,  provided
              that such  award  shall be  adjusted  by  multiplying  the  amount
              thereof by a fraction,  the numerator of which shall be the number
              of full  and  partial  calendar  months  between  the  date of the
              beginning  of  each  such  performance   cycle  and  the  date  of
              termination  or death,  and the  denominator of which shall be the
              number of full and  partial  calendar  months from the date of the
              beginning  of  the  performance  cycle  to the  end  of  the  said
              performance cycle;

         (iii)except as otherwise  provided in the terms and  conditions  of the
              stock  option or SAR  grant,  the  holder or the  Estate  shall be
              entitled to exercise  (provided any vesting  requirement  has been
              satisfied  as of the date of  exercise)  any  Option  or SAR for a
              period of five years  (three  years in the case of options or SARs
              granted prior to 1997) from such date of death,  total  disability
              or  retirement,  or for such longer  period as the  Committee  may
              determine  in the case of  financial  hardship  or  other  unusual
              circumstances  (subject to the maximum exercise period for Options
              and  SARs  specified  in  Paragraph  7II(b)  and  7III(a)  hereof,
              respectively);

         (iv) except as otherwise provided in the written instrument  evidencing
              the Restricted Stock Units, upon death or termination due to total
              disability  the holder or the Estate  shall be entitled to receive
              payment in respect of the  Restricted  Stock Units,  provided that
              such Units shall be adjusted by multiplying  the amount thereof by
              a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full and
              partial  calendar  months  between the date of grant of such Units
              and the date of death or termination, and the denominator of which
              shall be the number of full and partial  calendar  months from the
              date of the  grant  to the  end of the  Restriction  Period.  Upon
              retirement,  the  participant's  rights with respect to Restricted
              Stock Units shall immediately terminate.

     (c) In the  event of  resignation  by the  participant,  the  participant's
         rights and interests  under the Plan shall  immediately  terminate upon
         such resignation;  provided, however, that the Committee shall have the
         absolute  discretion  to review the  reasons and  circumstances  of the
         resignation  and to  determine  whether,  alternatively,  and  to  what
         extent,  if any,  the  participant  may  continue to hold any rights or
         interests under the Plan.

                                       12
<PAGE>




     (d) A transfer of a participant's  employment without an intervening period
         from the Corporation to a Subsidiary Corporation or vice versa, or from
         one  Subsidiary   Corporation  to  another,   shall  not  be  deemed  a
         termination of employment.

     (e) The  Committee  shall  be  authorized  to make all  determinations  and
         calculations required by this Paragraph 8, including any determinations
         necessary to establish the reason for  terminations  of employment  for
         purposes of the Plan, which  determinations  and calculations  shall be
         conclusive and binding on any affected participants and Estates.

9.   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     No  Performance  Stock  Units,  Options,  SARs or  Restricted  Stock  Units
     (hereinafter collectively an "Interest") granted pursuant to the Plan shall
     be exercisable or realized in whole or in part, and the  Corporation  shall
     not be obligated  to sell,  distribute  or issue any shares  subject to any
     such Interest,  if such exercise and sale would,  in the opinion of counsel
     for the  Corporation,  violate the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended (or
     other Federal or state statutes having similar requirements). Each Interest
     shall be subject to the further  requirement that, if at any time the Board
     of  Directors  shall  determine  in its  discretion  that  the  listing  or
     qualification  of the shares relating or subject to such Interest under any
     securities  exchange  requirements  or under  any  applicable  law,  or the
     consent or approval of any  governmental  regulatory  body, is necessary or
     desirable as a condition  of, or in connection  with,  the granting of such
     Interest or the distribution or issue of shares  thereunder,  such Interest
     may  not  be   exercised   in  whole  or  in  part  unless  such   listing,
     qualification,  consent or  approval  shall have been  effected or obtained
     free of any condition not acceptable to the Board of Directors.

     Interests may be subject to restrictions as to resale or other  disposition
     and to such other  provisions as may be  appropriate to comply with Federal
     and state securities laws and stock exchange requirements, and the exercise
     of any Interest or entitlement to payment thereunder may be contingent upon
     receipt  from the holder  (or any other  person  permitted  by this Plan to
     exercise  any  Interest  or  receive  any  distribution   hereunder)  of  a
     representation  that at the  time of such  exercise  it is his or her  then
     present  intention to acquire the shares being  distributed  for investment
     and not for resale.

10.  NONTRANSFERABILITY

     Unless  otherwise  approved  by  the  Committee,   contingent  AIP  grants,
     Performance Stock Units,  Options,  SARs and Restricted Stock Units granted
     under  the Plan to an  employee  shall be  nonassignable  and  shall not be
     transferable  by him or her  otherwise  than by will or the laws of descent
     and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during the employee's lifetime,
     only by the employee or the employee's guardian or legal representative.


                                       13
<PAGE>



11.  DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

     No provision in the Plan or any contingent  target AIP grants,  Performance
     Stock Units,  Options,  SARs or Restricted  Stock Units granted pursuant to
     the Plan shall be construed to confer upon the  participant any right to be
     employed  by  the  Corporation  or by  any  Subsidiary  Corporation,  or to
     interfere in any way with the right and authority of the Corporation or any
     Subsidiary  Corporation  either to increase or decrease the compensation of
     the participant at any time, or to terminate any relationship of employment
     between  the  participant  and  the  Corporation  or any of its  Subsidiary
     Corporations.

     Participants  under the Plan shall have none of the rights of a stockholder
     of the  Corporation  with respect to shares  subject to  Performance  Stock
     Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units unless and until such shares
     have been issued to him or her.

12.  STOCK ADJUSTMENTS

     In the event that the shares of Common  Stock,  as  presently  constituted,
     shall be changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
     of stock or other  securities of the Corporation or of another  corporation
     (whether   by   reason   of   merger,   consolidation,    recapitalization,
     reclassification,  stock split, combination of shares or otherwise),  or if
     the number of such shares of Common  Stock shall be  increased  through the
     payment of a stock dividend, or a dividend on the shares of Common Stock of
     rights or warrants to purchase securities of the Corporation shall be made,
     then there shall be substituted  for or added to each share available under
     and  subject to the Plan as  provided  in  Paragraph  2 hereof,  and to the
     limitations set forth in Paragraphs 7II (c); 7III (g) and 7IV (e), and each
     share  theretofore  appropriated or thereafter  subject or which may become
     subject to Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units
     under the Plan, the number and kind of shares of stock or other  securities
     into which each  outstanding  share of Common  Stock shall be so changed or
     for which each such share  shall be  exchanged  or to which each such share
     shall be entitled,  as the case may be.  Outstanding  Options and SARs also
     shall be  appropriately  amended  as to  price  and  other  terms as may be
     necessary to reflect the foregoing  events. In the event there shall be any
     other  change  in the  number or kind of the  outstanding  shares of Common
     Stock,  or of any stock or other  securities  into which the  Common  Stock
     shall have been changed or for which it shall have been exchanged,  then if
     the Board of Directors shall, in its sole  discretion,  determine that such
     change  equitably  requires an adjustment in the shares available under and
     subject to the Plan, or in any Performance  Stock Units,  Options,  SARs or
     Restricted  Stock Units  theretofore  granted or which may be granted under
     the  Plan,  such  adjustments   shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  such
     determination.

     No fractional  shares of Common Stock or units of other securities shall be
     issued pursuant to any such  adjustment,  and any fractions  resulting from
     any such adjustment  shall be eliminated in each case by rounding  downward
     to the nearest whole share or unit.


                                       14

13.  TAXES

     The  Corporation  shall be  entitled  to  withhold  the  amount  of any tax
     attributable to any amounts  payable or shares of Common Stock  deliverable
     under the Plan. The person  entitled to any such  delivery,  whether due to
     the settlement of PSUs, the exercise of an Option or SAR, or the vesting of
     Restricted  Stock Units,  or any other  taxable event may, by notice to the
     Corporation, elect to have such withholding satisfied by a reduction of the
     number of shares otherwise so deliverable (a "Stock Withholding Election"),
     or by delivery of shares of Stock  already owned by the  Participant,  with
     the amount of shares subject to such reduction or delivery to be calculated
     based on the Fair Market Value on the date of such taxable event. Reporting
     Persons may make a Stock  Withholding  Election only in accordance with the
     methods then permitted under applicable  Securities and Exchange Commission
     interpretations.

14.  EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

     The Plan shall become  effective upon adoption by the Board of Directors of
     the  Corporation,  provided such adoption is approved by the  stockholders,
     within  twelve  months of  adoption by the Board of  Directors.  Contingent
     target AIP grants,  Performance Stock Units,  Options,  SARs and Restricted
     Stock Units  under this Plan,  granted  before  approval of the Plan by the
     stockholders,  shall be granted  subject to such  approval and shall not be
     exercisable or payable before such approval.

     The  Board of  Directors  at any  time may  terminate  the  Plan,  but such
     termination  shall  not alter or impair  any of the  rights or  obligations
     under any contingent target AIP grants,  Performance Stock Units,  Options,
     SARs or Restricted  Stock Units  theretofore  granted under the Plan unless
     the affected participant shall so consent.

15.  PRIOR PLAN

     Effective  upon the  adoption  of this Plan by the Board of  Directors,  no
     additional  grants  of  contingent  target  grants  under  the  AIP  or  of
     Performance  Stock  Units shall be made under the MIP;  provided,  that any
     payments  of AIP awards or  deferrals  thereof  made with  respect to prior
     grants of contingent  AIP awards,  any prior grants of any LTIP Units,  and
     any payments of LTIP awards or deferrals  thereto made with respect to such
     prior grants, shall not be affected.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
     extent the remaining  shares reserved for use under the LTIP portion of the
     MIP are  insufficient  for any LTIP awards  under  performance  cycles that
     began  prior to January 1, 1987,  shares  available  under this Plan may be
     used for such purpose.

16.  APPLICATION OF FUNDS

     The proceeds  received by the  Corporation  from the sale of capital  stock
     pursuant to Options will be used for general corporate purposes.

                                       15
<PAGE>



17.  NO OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE OPTION OR SAR

     The  granting  of an  Option or SAR shall  impose  no  obligation  upon the
optionee to exercise such Option or SAR.

18.  AMENDMENT

     The Board of Directors by majority vote, at any time and from time to time,
     may amend the Plan in such respects as it shall deem advisable,  to conform
     to  any   change  in  any   applicable   law  or  in  any  other   respect.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan may not be terminated or amended in
     a manner adverse to the interests of any  participant  (without the consent
     of the participant)  either: (a) after a Potential Change in Control occurs
     and for one (1) year  following  the  cessation  of a  Potential  Change in
     Control,  or (b) for a two-year period beginning as of the date of a Change
     in Control (the  "Coverage  Period").  Upon the  expiration of the Coverage
     Period,  subparagraph  (l) of Paragraph 7II of the Plan and Paragraph 8 (a)
     of the Plan may not be amended in any manner  that would  adversely  affect
     any participant without the consent of the participant.

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                           AMENDED AND RESTATED (1999)
                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN



         1.  PURPOSE OF PLAN.  The purpose of the Amended  and  Restated  (1999)
Supplemental  Executive  Retirement Plan  (hereinafter  called the "Plan") is to
obtain for Hershey Foods Corporation  (hereinafter called the "Corporation") all
of the  benefits  which  flow  from  maintaining  a  strong  management  team by
providing  to  executive  and  upper  level  management  employees  the means to
continue  their  attained  standard of living during  retirement and by offering
benefits  that will assist in attracting  executive  and upper level  management
employees of outstanding  ability.  The Plan is an amendment to and  restatement
(as amended) of the Hershey Foods Corporation Amended and Restated  Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan, as amended from time to time which was in effect from
November 1, 1994 to June 8, 1999.

         2.  DEFINITIONS.  The  following  words and  phrases  as used in the
Plan shall have the following  meanings,  unless a different  meaning is plainly
required by the context:

                  a.  "Cause"  means the  willful  engaging  by an  employee  of
the Corporation in illegal conduct or gross  misconduct  which is materially and
demonstrably injurious to the Corporation.

         For purposes of this definition,  no act or failure to act, on the part
of an employee of the  Corporation,  shall be considered  "willful" unless it is
done, or omitted to be done, by the employee in bad faith and without reasonable
belief that the  employee's  action or omission was in the best  interest of the
Corporation.  Any act or failure to act,  based upon prior approval given by the
Board or upon  the  instruction  or with the  approval  of the  Chief  Executive
Officer or the  employee's  superior or based upon the advice of counsel for the
Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by
the employee in good faith and in the best interest of the Corporation.

                  b.  "Committee"  means the  Compensation and Executive
Organization  Committee  of the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Corporation  (the
"Board").

                  c.  "Deferred Retirement Date" means the first day of the
month  following an employee's  termination of employment  with the  Corporation
provided such termination occurs after his Normal Retirement Date.

                  d.  "Disability"  or  "Disabled",  for  purposes of this Plan,
shall have the same meaning as provided in Section 1.16 of the Retirement  Plan,
as such section may be amended from time to time.
<PAGE>
                  e.  "Early  Retirement  Date" means the first day of any month
following an employee's  termination of employment with the Corporation which is
coincident  with or following his  fifty-fifth  (55th) birthday and prior to his
Normal Retirement Date.

                  f.  "Final  Average  Compensation"  means  the  sum of (1) the
highest  annual average of a Vested  Participant's  basic salary paid or accrued
over any thirty-six (36) consecutive month period during his last ten (10) years
of employment  with the  Corporation  and (2) the highest  annual average of his
annual awards under the Annual Incentive Program  (hereinafter called the "AIP")
of the Corporation's  Key Employee  Incentive Plan ("KEIP") paid or accrued over
any  five (5)  consecutive  calendar  years  during  his last ten (10)  years of
employment with the  Corporation.  If a Vested  Participant  dies,  retires,  or
suffers a Disability or if a Participant  suffers a Disability during a calendar
year and only a partial  AIP award is made for that year,  for  purposes  of the
Plan, his AIP award for such year will be considered to equal the award actually
made  divided  by  the  fraction  of  such  year  that  he was  employed  by the
Corporation  prior  to  his  death,  retirement  or  Disability.   If  a  Vested
Participant  otherwise  terminates  employment  with  the  Corporation  during a
calendar  year,  his AIP award for that  year for  purposes  of the Plan will be
considered to be zero (0),  regardless of whether any AIP award is actually made
for that year.

                  g. "GATT Interest Rate" means,  for purposes of this Plan, for
any specific month, the annual interest rate on 30-year  Treasury  securities as
specified  by the  Commissioner  of the  Internal  Revenue  Service  in  revenue
rulings,  notices or other guidance,  published in the Internal  Revenue Service
Bulletin,  decreased by the percentage  applicable to such month as set forth on
Schedule I attached hereto.

                  h.  "Lump Sum Interest Rate" means, as of any specific date:

                           (x) after  January  1, 1998 and prior to  January  1,
         2000 the sum of one twelfth (1/12th) of each PBGC Interest Rate for the
         twelve months preceding such date;

                           (y) after  December  31, 1999 and prior to January 1,
         2001,  the sum of  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of each GATT Interest Rate for
         November  1999 and each month  thereafter  to and  including the second
         month  preceding  the month during which such date occurs plus,  if the
         number  of months  for  which a GATT  Interest  Rate is  determined  as
         described is less than twelve, the sum of one-twelfth  (1/12th) of each
         PBGC  Interest  Rate for  December  1999 and  each  preceding  month in
         reverse  chronological order until the total number of months for which
         a GATT Interest  Rate and/or a PBGC  Interest Rate has been  determined
         equals twelve; and

                           (z) after  December 31, 2000,  the sum of one twelfth
         (1/12th) of each GATT Interest Rate for the twelve  consecutive  months
         beginning with the thirteenth  (13th) month  preceding the month during
         which such date occurs.

Plan,  the first day of the  month  nearest  an  employee's  sixty-fifth  (65th)
birthday,  except that if his birthday is equally near the first of two calendar
months,  the first day of the month  prior to his  sixty-fifth  (65th)  birthday
shall be his Normal Retirement Date.

                   j. "PBGC Interest Rate" means,  for any specific  month,  the

Participant  who, as of such date,  satisfies each  eligibility  requirement set
forth in the first sentence of Section 3 of the Plan.

                   n. "Years of Service",  for purposes of this Plan, shall have
the same meaning as provided in Section  1.56 of the  Retirement  Plan,  as such
section may be amended from time to time.

         3.  ELIGIBILITY.  An  employee of the  Corporation  will be eligible to
receive  a  benefit  pursuant  to  Section  4 of the Plan if, at the time of his
termination of employment with the Corporation, such employee (i) is at least 55
years of age, (ii) has ten (10) Years of Service,  and (iii) has participated in
the performance share unit portion of the KEIP for at least five (5) of his last
ten  (10)  years  of  employment  with  the  Corporation.  No  employee  of  the
Corporation, regardless of whether he satisfies all the eligibility requirements
to be a Vested Participant,  shall be entitled to receive any benefits under the
Plan  if  his  employment   with  the   Corporation  is  terminated  for  Cause.
Notwithstanding  the above, an employee whose  employment is terminated with the

percent (3 2/3%) of his Final Average  Compensation and his Years of Service not
in excess of fifteen (15) Years of Service;

                           reduced by:

                           (2)  one  hundred   percent   (100%)  of  the  Vested
         Participant's  retirement  benefit  under the  Retirement  Plan and any
         other  tax-qualified  defined  benefit  pension plan  maintained by the
         Corporation  or any affiliate  thereof or any defined  benefit  pension
         plan  maintained  by  any  other  entity,  payable  as a  life  annuity
         commencing  at his Normal  Retirement  Date or his Deferred  Retirement
         Date if he retires  after his Normal  Retirement  Date,  regardless  of
         whether  such  benefit  payment is in that form or begins at that time;
         and

                           (3) one hundred  percent (100%) of the primary social
         security benefit to which the Vested  Participant  would be entitled on
         his  Normal  Retirement  Date  or his  Deferred  Retirement  Date if he
         retires  after his  Normal  Retirement  Date  regardless  of whether he
         receives any portion of such primary  Social  Security  benefit on such
         date.

         Payment of such benefit shall commence on his Normal Retirement Date if
he retires (or otherwise has his employment terminated, other than for Cause) on
such date and on his Deferred  Retirement  Date if he retires (or  otherwise has
his  employment  terminated,  other than for Cause) after his Normal  Retirement
Date.

                  b. Early  Retirement  Benefit.  An employee who qualifies as a
Vested  Participant  on the  date of his  termination  of  employment  with  the
Corporation, and who retires (or whose employment is otherwise terminated, other
than for  Cause) on or after his Early  Retirement  Date and prior to his Normal
Retirement Date shall be entitled under the Plan to receive an early  retirement
benefit which shall be an annual benefit payable in monthly installments,  equal
to:

(1) the product of three and  two-thirds  percent (3 2/3%) of his Final  Average
Compensation  and his Years of Service  not in excess of  fifteen  (15) Years of
Service;

                           reduced by:

                           (2) one  hundred  percent  (100%)  of his  retirement
         benefit under the Retirement Plan and any other  tax-qualified  defined
         benefit  pension plan  maintained by the  Corporation  or any affiliate
         thereof or any defined  benefit  pension plan  maintained  by any other
         entity,  payable as a life annuity  commencing at his Early  Retirement
         Date or the first  date  thereafter  on which  such  benefits  would be
         payable if they are not payable on his Early Retirement Date regardless
         of whether such benefit payment is in that form or begins at that time;
         and

                                       4
<PAGE>

                           (3) one hundred  percent (100%) of the primary Social
         Security benefit to which the Vested  Participant  would be entitled on
         his Early  Retirement  Date or the first date  thereafter on which such
         benefits  would  be  payable  if they  are  not  payable  on his  Early
         Retirement  Date  regardless of whether he receives any portion of such
         primary Social Security benefit on such date; and

                           (4) the product of (a) the difference between (1) and
         the sum of (2) and (3), (b) five-twelfths of a percent (5/12%), and (c)
         the   number  of   complete   calendar   months  by  which  the  Vested
         Participant's  date of termination of employment  precedes his sixtieth
         (60th) birthday.

         Payment of such  benefit  shall  commence on the first day of the month
coincident  with the Vested  Participant's  retirement or other  termination  of
employment, other than for Cause.

                  c.  Disability  Retirement  Benefit.  If an employee who is an
active  participant in the performance  share unit portion of the KEIP suffers a
Disability  prior to his  Normal  Retirement  Date  and  while  employed  by the
Corporation, the period of his Disability will be recognized as Years of Service
and as years of participation in the performance  share unit portion of the KEIP
under the Plan. If such Disability  continues to his Normal Retirement Date, for
purposes  of the Plan,  he will  retire on that date and will be  entitled  to a
normal retirement benefit calculated in accordance with Section 4.a.  commencing
on that date. In calculating  the benefit under Section 4.a., the  Participant's
Final  Average  Compensation  shall  be equal to his  annual  base  compensation
immediately  prior to his  Disability  plus the average of his AIP earned during
the three (3) years immediately prior to the commencement of his Disability.

                  d. Pre-Retirement  Death Benefit. If a Participant dies before
his  employment  by  the  Corporation  terminates  and  qualifies  as  a  Vested
Participant on his date of death, his designated beneficiary(ies), or his estate
if he has not designated any  beneficiary or  beneficiaries  in accordance  with
procedures  established by the Committee,  shall receive within ten (10) days of
the Vested  Participant's  death a death  benefit  equal to the lump sum present
value of one hundred  percent (100%) of the  retirement  benefit that would have
been payable to the Vested  Participant  under Sections 4.a. or 4.b.  (including
the spousal  survivor  benefit payable  pursuant to Section 4.e. with respect to
any Vested  Participant  survived  by a spouse) if he had retired on the date of
his  death.  The  lump sum  present  value of the  retirement  benefit  shall be
calculated using: (x) for each Vested  Participant who was a Vested  Participant
on January 1, 1998, (i) the 83 GAM mortality  tables;  and (ii) an interest rate
equal to the sum of  one-twelfth  (1/12th)  of each PBGC  Interest  Rate for the
twelve (12) months  immediately  preceding the date of the Vested  Participant's
death; and (y) for each Vested Participant who first became a Vested Participant
after January 1, 1998,  (i) the  prevailing  commissioner's  standard  mortality
table  (described in Section  807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as  amended  from time to time) used to  determine  reserves  for group  annuity
contracts issued on the date of the Vested  Participant's  death (without regard
to any other  subparagraph for such Section 807(d)(5)) that is prescribed by the
Commissioner of the Internal  Revenue Service in revenue  rulings,  notices,  or
other guidance published in the Internal Revenue

                                       5
<PAGE>


Bulletin;  and (ii) an interest  rate equal to the Lump Sum Interest  Rate as of
the date of the Vested Participant's death.

                  e. Post-Retirement  Death Benefit. If a Vested Participant who
is  receiving  monthly  retirement   benefits  under  this  Plan  following  his
termination of employment by the Corporation  dies, his surviving  spouse, if he
is survived by a spouse,  shall be  entitled  to receive a death  benefit  which
shall be a monthly payment for the spouse's life,  beginning on the first day of
the month following the Vested Participant's death, equal to:

                           (1)      fifty  percent  (50%) of the  monthly
retirement  benefit to which the Vested  Participant was entitled under the Plan
prior to his death;

                           reduced by:

                           (2) the monthly  annuity value of any life  insurance
         provided  by the  Corporation  or any  affiliate  thereof  for  retired
         employees  that  is  in  excess  of  post-retirement  group  term  life
         insurance  regularly  provided  by the  Corporation  or  any  affiliate
         thereof.

         5.  ADMINISTRATION  OF THE PLAN.  The  Committee  is  charged  with the
administration  of the Plan.  It shall have full power and authority to construe
and interpret the Plan. Its decisions shall be final,  conclusive and binding on
all parties.  Subject to Section 10 of this Plan, the Committee  shall also have
the  power,  in its sole  discretion,  at any time (i) to waive,  in whole or in
part, application of any of the eligibility  requirements of Section 3 or of the
benefit  reduction  factors in Sections  4.a. and 4.b. and (ii) to determine the
timing  and form of payment of any  benefit  under the Plan,  in the case of any
individual Participant,  Vested Participant or other employee of the Corporation
who has participated in the performance share unit portion of the KEIP.

         6. OPTIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT. In lieu of the monthly retirement benefit
(including the spousal survivor benefit payable pursuant to Section 4.e. hereof)
payable pursuant to Section 4.a. or 4.b. hereof to a Vested Participant (and his
surviving  spouse) who retires (or whose employment is terminated other than for
Cause) after August 2, 1994 (such benefit payable to a Vested Participant and/or
his surviving spouse is herein referred to for purposes of this Section 6 as the
"Applicable  Retirement Benefit"),  such Vested Participant may elect to receive
the following form of benefit payment:

         A lump sum cash payment,  payable to the Vested  Participant within ten

preceding  the  date of the  Vested  Participant's  retirement  (or  the  Vested
Participant's   date  of  termination  of  employment  other  than  for  Cause),
calculated  in  accordance  with the  Corporation's  practices  for  determining
retirement  benefits;  and (y) for each Vested  Participant

                                       6

who first became a Vested  Participant  after January 1, 1998 (i) the prevailing
commissioner's  standard  mortality table (described in Section  807(d)(5)(A) of
the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended  from  time to time)  used to

employment  other than for Cause) (without regard to any other  subparagraph for
such Section  807(d)(5)) that is prescribed by the  Commissioner of the Internal
Revenue Service in revenue rulings,  notices, or other guidance published in the
Internal  Revenue  Bulletin;  and (ii) an  interest  rate  equal to the Lump Sum

         director  subsequent to June 8, 1999,  whose election or nomination for
         election was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent

         result of an actual or  threatened  election  contest (as  described in
         Rule 14a-11  under the  Exchange  Act)  ("Election  Contest")  or other
         actual or  threatened  solicitation  of  proxies or  consents  by or on
         behalf of any Person other than the Board ("Proxy Contest"),  including
         by reason of any  agreement  intended  to avoid or settle any  Election
         Contest or Proxy Contest,  shall be deemed an Incumbent  Director;  and
         PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that a director who has been approved by the

         8.  PAYMENT OF  BENEFITS.  Nothing  contained in the Plan and no action
taken  pursuant to the  provisions  of the Plan shall  create or be construed to
create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary  relationship between the Corporation
and any  Participant,  Vested  Participant,  spouse of a  Participant  or Vested
Participant,  or any other person. No person other than the


                                       9
<PAGE>

Corporation  shall by virtue of the  provisions of the Plan have any interest in
such assets.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments
from the  Corporation  under the Plan,  such right shall be no greater  than the
right of any unsecured  general  creditor of the  Corporation.  The right of any
Vested Participant or any other person to the payment of benefits under the Plan
shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered; such payments and the
right thereto are expressly declared to be non-assignable  and  nontransferable.
No  payments  hereunder  shall be subject to the claim of the  creditors  of any
Vested  Participant or of any other person entitled to payments  hereunder.  Any
payments  required  to be made  pursuant  to the Plan to a person who is under a
legal  disability  may be made by the  Corporation to or for the benefit of such
person in such of the following ways as the Committee shall determine:

                  a.       directly to such person.
                  b.       to the legal representative of such person.
                  c.       to a near relative of such person to be used for such
 person's benefit.
                  d.       directly in payment of expenses of support,
maintenance or education of such person.

                   The  Corporation   shall  not  be  required  to  see  to  the
application by any third party of any payments made pursuant to the Plan.

         9.   EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  PLAN.   This  Amended  and  Restated   (1999)
Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan  shall be  effective  June 9, 1999 and
Vested  Participants  who become  eligible to retire  under the Plan on or after
that date shall be entitled to the benefits provided hereunder.

         10.  AMENDMENT,  SUSPENSION OR  TERMINATION  OF THE PLAN.  The Board of
Directors of the  Corporation  may, at any time,  suspend or terminate the Plan.
The Board may also from time to time,  amend the Plan in such respects as it may
deem  advisable in order that  benefits  provided  hereunder  may conform to any
change  in law or in other  respects  which  the  Board  deems to be in the best
interest of the Corporation. No such suspension, termination or amendment of the
Plan shall adversely affect any right of any person who is a Vested  Participant
at  the   time  of   such   suspension,   termination   or   amendment   or  his
beneficiary(ies), estate or surviving spouse, as applicable, to receive benefits
under the Plan in accordance with its provisions in effect  immediately prior to
such  suspension,  termination  or amendment  without the consent of such Vested
Participant,  beneficiary(ies), estate or surviving spouse. Any benefits payable
under  the  terms  of the  Plan at the time of any  suspension,  termination  or
amendment of the Plan shall remain in effect  according to their original terms,
or such  alternate  terms as may be in the best  interests  of both  parties and
agreed to by the Vested  Participant or his  beneficiaries,  estate or surviving
spouse, as applicable.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  (a) the Plan may not be
terminated  or  amended in any manner  that is  adverse  to the  interests  of

                                       10
<PAGE>


a Participant  or the surviving  spouse of a Participant  without the consent of
the  Participant  or  surviving  spouse,  as  applicable,  either:  (i)  after a
Potential  Change in Control occurs and for one (1) year following the cessation
of the Potential  Change in Control,  or (ii) for a two year period beginning on
the date of a Change in Control (the "Coverage Period");  and (b) no termination
of this Plan or  amendment  hereof in a manner  adverse to the  interests of any
Participant  (without the consent of the Participant or surviving  spouse) shall
be effective  if such  termination  or amendment  occurs (i) at the request of a
third  party who has taken  steps  reasonably  calculated  to effect a Change of
Control,  or (ii) in connection  with or in anticipation of a Change of Control.
After the  Coverage  Period,  the Plan may not be amended or  terminated  in any
manner that would  adversely  affect the  entitlement  of a  Participant  or his
surviving spouse (without the consent of the Participant or surviving spouse) to
benefits that have accrued hereunder.  For purposes of the immediately preceding
two  sentences  of this  Section  10,  whether an  employee  of the  Corporation
qualifies  as a  Participant  shall be  determined  at the time (a) the Coverage
Period  commences and any time thereafter or (b) his employment is terminated or
the Plan is  amended  (i) at the  request of a third  party who has taken  steps
reasonably  calculated to effect a Change of Control, or (ii) in connection with
or in anticipation of a Change of Control.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  Hershey Foods  Corporation has caused this Hershey
Foods Corporation Amended and Restated (1999) Supplemental  Executive Retirement
Plan to be executed as of this 9th day of June, 1999.

                                   (GROUP 3A)


         The Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits Protection Plan (Group

management  employees and maintain a stable work environment by making provision
for the protection of covered  employees in connection  with a Change in Control
as set forth herein.


                                    ARTICLE 1

year period preceding his Date of Termination.

         For purposes of the foregoing,  salary reduction  elections pursuant to
Sections 125 and 401(k) of the Code shall not be taken into account.

         1.3     ANNUAL BONUS means with respect to an Executive the highest of:


                  1.3.1  the  average  of the  three  highest  bonuses  paid  or
payable,  including  any bonus or  portion  thereof  which has been  earned  but
deferred,  to him by the  Company in respect of the five  fiscal  years (or such
shorter  period  during which he has been employed by the Company or eligible to
receive  any bonus  payment)  immediately  preceding  the fiscal year in which a
Change in Control  occurs  (annualized  for any fiscal  year  during such period
consisting  of less than twelve full months or with respect to which he has been
employed by the Company or eligible to receive a bonus for less than twelve full
months);

                  1.3.2 the  bonus  paid or  payable  (annualized  as  described
above),  including  any  bonus or  portion  thereof  which has been  earned  but
deferred, to him by the Company in respect of the most recently completed fiscal

including his Date of Termination.

         For purposes  herein,  only payments under the AIP, as well as payments
under any successor or replacement  substitute  plan,  shall be treated as bonus
payments.

         1.4      BASE AMOUNT  shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in
Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code.

         1.5      BOARD  means the Board of Directors of the Company.


         1.6      CAUSE  means with respect to an Executive:

perform his duties with the Company (other than any such failure  resulting from
incapacity  due to  physical  or mental  illness),  after a written  demand  for
substantial  performance is delivered to him by the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company  which  specifically  identifies  the manner in which the
Board  or  Chief  Executive   Officer   believes  that  the  Executive  has  not
substantially performed his duties; or

                  1.6.2 his  willfully  engaging  in  illegal  conduct  or gross
misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.

         For purposes of this Section 1.6, no act or failure to act, on the part
of an Executive, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be
done,  by him in bad faith and  without  reasonable  belief  that his  action or
omission was in the best  interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act,
based upon prior approval given by the Board or upon the instruction or with the
approval of the Chief Executive Officer or an Executive's superior or based upon
the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done,
or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best  interests
of the Company.  The cessation of employment of an Executive shall not be deemed
to be for Cause  unless and until there shall have been  delivered to him a copy
of a  resolution  duly  adopted  by  the  affirmative  vote  of  not  less  than
three-quarters  of the entire  membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to him and
he is given an  opportunity,  together  with  counsel,  to be heard  before  the
Board),  finding that,  in the good faith opinion of the Board,  he is guilty of
the conduct  described in Subsection  1.6.1 or 1.6.2 above,  and  specifying the
particulars thereof in detail.

         1.7      CLRP means the Hershey Foods  Corporation  Compensation  Limit
Replacement Plan and any successor or replacement plan thereof.

(the  "Incumbent  Directors")  cease  for any  reason to  constitute  at least a
majority of the Board,  provided that any

                                       2
<PAGE>

person  becoming  a  director  subsequent  to June 8, 1999,  whose  election  or
nomination  for election was  approved by a vote of at least  two-thirds  of the
Incumbent Directors then on the Board (either by specific vote or by approval of
the proxy  statement of the Company in which such person is named as nominee for
director,  without written  objection to such nomination)  shall be an Incumbent
Director;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that no individual initially elected or nominated
as a director  of the  Company as a result of an actual or  threatened  election
contest (as described in Rule 14a-11 under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934
(the  "Exchange  Act"))  ("Election  Contest")  or other  actual  or  threatened

Benefit plus all  investment  credits  applied  thereto in  accordance  with the
provisions  of Section 2.5 hereof  being herein  referred to as "Vested  Pension
Amount"), where:


                  2.3.1.1    for purposes of determining  such
Executive's SERP Benefit as of the date of a Change in Control, he shall: (i) be
credited for all purposes  under the SERP with  additional  Years of Service (as
defined  in the SERP)  equal to the  lesser of three (3) or the  number of years
(including  fractions  thereof)  from the date of the Change in Control until he
would attain Mandatory Retirement Age if applicable to him; (ii) be credited for
purposes  of only  Section 3 of the SERP (and not for the  purposes of any other
provision of the SERP,  including but not limited to Section 4(a)(1) and Section
4(b)(1)) with additional  Years of Service (as defined in the SERP) equal to the
excess,  if any,  of ten  (10)  over his  actual  number  of  Years  of  Service
(including fractions thereof) completed as of the date of the Change in Control;
(iii) be  deemed  for the  purposes  of  Section  3 of the SERP (and not for the
purposes  of any  other  provision  of the  SERP)  to have  five  (5)  years  of
participation in the performance  share unit portion of the KEIP during his last
ten (10) years of employment with the Company  regardless of his actual years of
participation  in the performance  share unit portion of the KEIP at the time of
the Change in Control; (iv) be deemed for all purposes under the SERP (including
but not  limited  to  clause  (4) of  Section  4.b of the  SERP) to have his age
increased  by  three  (3)  years  (or such  lesser  number  of years  (including
fractions) until he would attain Mandatory Retirement Age if applicable to him);
and (v) be deemed to have been paid his Annual Base Salary and Annual  Bonus for
three (3) additional years (or such lesser number of years (including fractions)
until  he  would  attain  Mandatory  Retirement  Age if  applicable  to him) for
purposes of  calculating  "Final  Average  Compensation"  in Section 2.f. of the
SERP;

                           2.3.1.2    if such  Executive has not yet attained
age fifty-five (55) (after  increasing his age by three (3) years as provided in
the preceding Subsection 2.3.1.1), he shall upon the occurrence of the Change in
Control be deemed  nevertheless  to have attained age fifty-five  (55), with the
adjustments provided for in Subsection 2.3.1.1 hereof being made on this basis;

                           2.3.1.3    the actuarial  present value of such
Executive's  SERP  Benefit,  as  determined  in  accordance  with the  foregoing
provisions  of this  Section  2.3  shall  be  determined  using:  (i) the 83 GAM
mortality  tables;  and (ii) an interest rate equal to 100% of the interest rate
that  would be used (as of the date of the  Change in  Control)  by the  Pension
Benefit Guaranty  Corporation for purposes of determining the present value of a
lump sum distribution on plan  termination;  and (iii) the date of the Change in
Control  as the date on which  payment  of the  Executive's  SERP  Benefit is to
commence and as the date as of which the  actuarial  present  value of such SERP
Benefit is calculated; and

<PAGE>

                  2.3.2 each  Executive who neither is a participant in the SERP
on the date of the Change in Control  nor was a  participant  in the SERP on the
date of the  Potential  Change in Control  preceding the Change in Control shall
have a vested and  nonforfeitable  right  hereunder to receive in cash an amount
equal to the sum of:

                           2.3.2.1    a lump sum cash amount  equal to the
actuarial  equivalent of the excess of (x) the retirement pension (determined as
a straight life annuity  commencing at Normal  Retirement Age, as defined in the
Hershey Pension Plan) which he would have accrued under the terms of the Hershey
Pension  Plan  (as in  effect  immediately  prior  to the  Change  in  Control),
determined as if he were fully vested thereunder and had accumulated  thirty-six
(36) additional months of service credit thereunder during each of which he will
be  deemed  to have been paid  one-twelfth  (1/12th)  of the sum of his  highest
annual rate of  compensation  as an employee of the Company and his Annual Bonus
(but in no event  shall he be deemed to have  accumulated  additional  months of
service  credit  after he would  have  attained  Mandatory  Retirement  Age,  if
applicable)  over (y) the  retirement  pension  (determined  as a straight  life
annuity  commencing at Normal  Retirement Age) which he has accrued  pursuant to
the terms of the Hershey  Pension  Plan as of the date of the Change in Control;
and

                           2.3.2.2    if he is a participant in the CLRP, a lump
sum cash amount ("CLRP Benefit") equal to his Excess Account,  as defined in the
CLRP (as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control)  determined as if
he were fully vested  thereunder and had accumulated  thirty-six (36) additional
months of service  credit  thereunder  during each of which he will be deemed to
have been paid  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of the sum of his  highest  annual rate of
compensation as an employee of the Company and his Annual Bonus, but in no event
shall he be deemed to have accumulated additional months of service credit after
he would have attained  Mandatory  Retirement Age, if applicable (the sum of the
amounts  described in Subsections  2.3.2.1 and 2.3.2.2 is herein  referred to as
such  Executive's  "Vested Pension  Benefit" and the Vested Pension Benefit plus
all, if any, investment credit applied thereto in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.5 hereof is herein referred to as such Executive's  "Vested Pension
Amount").

         For purposes of this Subsection 2.3.2,  "actuarial  equivalent" amounts
shall be determined using the same methods and assumptions  prescribed under the
Hershey Pension Plan immediately prior to the Change in Control.

         2.4      PAYMENT OF VESTED PENSION AMOUNT UPON TIMELY ELECTION. The
Company  shall,  on the later of (i) the first day of  January of the year first
following  the year  during  which the  Change in  Control  occurs  and (ii) the
one-hundred  twentieth (120th) day following the Change in Control,  pay to each
Executive  a lump sum cash  payment  equal to his  Vested  Pension  Amount  plus
interest thereon at the rate provided in Section  1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from
the date of the Change in Control to the date of payment if, prior to the Change
in Control,  he elects,  in his sole  discretion,  to receive such lump sum cash
payment at such time.

         2.5      CONVERSION  OF  VESTED   PENSION   BENEFIT  TO  DEFERRED
COMPENSATION  PLAN ACCOUNT IN ABSENCE OF SECTION 2.4 ELECTION.  In the event the
Executive  makes no election  under  Section 2.4 hereof,  an amount equal to his
Vested Pension Benefit shall be credited to him under

                                       12
<PAGE>

the Deferred  Compensation Plan and subject to the provisions of this Subsection
2.5, the provisions of the Deferred  Compensation Plan shall apply thereto as if
such  amount  were a Deferred  AIP Award.  Within ten (10) days of the Change in
Control the Executive shall select one or more Investment  Options as defined in
the Deferred  Compensation  Plan to be effective with respect to such amount and
thereafter  may change his  selection of such  Investment  Options in accordance
with the provisions of the Deferred  Compensation Plan. Investment credits shall
be applied to the amount of his Vested  Pension  Benefit in accordance  with the
provisions  of the  Deferred  Compensation  Plan from the date of the  Change in
Control to the date of payment to the Executive in accordance with his selection
of such Investment Options. If the Executive makes no election under Section 2.4
hereof  and does not  select  one or more  Investment  Options as defined in the
Deferred  Compensation  Plan  within  ten (10) days of the  Change in Control in
accordance  with the  provisions  of the second  sentence of this  Section  2.5,
investment  credits shall be applied to the amount of his Vested Pension Benefit
from the date of the  Change in  Control  to the  earlier of the date he makes a
selection of  Investment  Options with respect  thereto in  accordance  with the
provisions  of the  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  and  the  date of  payment  in
accordance with the latest of his pre-Change in Control selections of Investment
Options  relating to his Deferred AIP Awards or Deferred PSU Awards,  if any. If
there are no such pre-Change in Control selections of Investment  Options,  then
investment  credits  shall be applied in accordance  with the  provisions of the
immediately  preceding  sentence  by  treating  the  Hershey  Fixed  Income Fund
Investment Option under the Deferred  Compensation Plan as his latest pre-Change
in Control selection of Investment  Options.  Within ten (10) days of the Change
in Control the  Executive  shall make a Deferral  Election  with  respect to his
Vested  Pension  Amount.  If the Executive  makes no election  under Section 2.4
hereof  and makes no  Deferral  Election  within  ten (10) days of the Change in
Control in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then for purposes
hereof he will be considered to have made a Deferral Election under the Deferred
Compensation  Plan to have his Vested Pension Amount paid to him, his designated
beneficiaries or his estate, as applicable, in accordance with the latest of his
pre-Change in Control Deferral  Elections relating to his Deferred AIP Awards or
Deferred PSU Awards, if any. If there are no such pre-Change in Control Deferral
Elections,  then  for  purposes  hereof  he will be  considered  to have  made a
Deferral  Election  under  the  Deferred  Compensation  Plan to have his  Vested
Pension  Amount paid to him,  his  designated  beneficiaries  or his estate,  as
applicable,  on  the  first  day of  the  month  following  his  termination  of
employment  by the Company.  His Vested  Pension  Amount shall be paid to him in
accordance  with  the  Deferral  Election   described  in  the  preceding  three
sentences,  as  applicable,  or any  subsequent  Deferral  Election with respect
thereto permitted in accordance with the provisions of the Deferred Compensation
Plan.

         2.6      SERP OR CLRP AMENDMENTS.  Notwithstanding any provision of
the SERP,  CLRP,  or Deferred  Compensation  Plan,  none of the SERP,  CLRP,  or
Deferred  Compensation  Plan may be  terminated or amended in any manner that is
adverse to the interests of any Executive without his consent either:  (i) after
a  Potential  Change  in  Control  occurs  and for one (1)  year  following  the
cessation of the Potential Change in Control, or (ii) after a Change in Control.
Any termination or amendment of the SERP, CLRP, or Deferred Compensation Plan in
a manner adverse to the interests of an Executive within one (1) year prior to a
Potential  Change in Control  shall not be given  effect for purposes of Section
2.3 or Section 2.5 hereof.

                  3.1.1 PREVIOUSLY EARNED SALARY. The Company shall pay his full
salary to him through  his Date of  Termination  at the  highest  rate in effect

                  3.1.2 PREVIOUSLY  EARNED  BENEFITS.  The Company shall pay his
normal post-termination compensation and benefits to him as such payments become
due. Such post-termination  compensation and benefits shall be determined under,
and  paid in  accordance  with the  Company's  retirement,  insurance,  pension,
welfare and other compensation or benefit plans, programs and arrangements.

                  3.1.3 PAYMENT OF VESTED  CURRENT  BONUS AMOUNT.  Except to the
extent that the Company has previously paid or concurrently pays to him all or a
portion of his Vested Current Bonus Amount  pursuant to Section 2.1,  Subsection

                  3.1.4 PAYMENT OF VESTED  DEFERRED BONUS AMOUNT.  Except to the

         3.2      SEVERANCE  BENEFITS.  In addition to the payments  provided
for by Section 3.1 hereof,  the Company  shall pay to an Executive  the payments
described in Subsections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 below (the "Severance Benefits") in
accordance  with such  Subsections  upon  termination of his employment with the
Company during the Coverage Period,  if his termination of employment either (i)
is a Section 1.39  Termination of Employment,  or (ii) is (a) not by the Company
for Cause,  (b) not by reason of his death or  Disability or after his Mandatory
Retirement Age, if applicable, and (c) not by him without Good Reason.

                  3.2.1  LUMP-SUM  SEVERANCE  PAYMENT.  In lieu  of any  further
salary payments to him for periods  subsequent to the Date of  Termination,  the
Company shall pay to him a lump sum severance  payment,  in cash, equal to three
(3) (or, if less,  the number of years,  including  fractions,  from the Date of
Termination until he would have reached Mandatory Retirement Age, if applicable)
times the sum of (a), (b) and (c) where (a) equals his Annual Base  Salary,  (b)
equals his Annual Bonus and (c) equals his Highest PSU Amount.

                  3.2.2 CONTINUED  BENEFITS.  For a thirty-six (36) month period
(or, if less, the number of months from the Date of  Termination  until he would
have  reached  Mandatory  Retirement  Age,  if  applicable)  after  the  Date of
Termination,  the  Company  shall  provide  him  with  life  insurance,  health,
disability and other welfare benefits ("Welfare Benefits") substantially similar
in all respects to those which he was receiving  immediately prior to the Notice
of  Termination  on  substantially  the same  terms  and  conditions,  including
contributions  required from him for such benefits (without giving effect to any
reduction  in such  benefits  subsequent  to the  Potential  Change  in  Control
preceding  the  Change in  Control or the  Change in  Control,  which  reduction
constitutes or may constitute Good Reason);  provided that if he cannot continue
to  participate in the Company plans  providing  Welfare  Benefits,  the Company
shall  otherwise  provide  such  benefits  on the  same  after-tax  basis  as if
continued  participation had been permitted.  The Executive shall be entitled to
elect to change his level of  coverage  and/or his  choice of  coverage  options
(such as Executive only or family medical  coverage) with respect to the Welfare
Benefits to be  provided by the Company to him to the same extent that  actively
employed executives of the Company are permitted to make such changes; provided,
however,  that in the event of any such  changes  he shall pay the amount of any
cost increase that would actually be paid by an actively  employed  executive of
the Company by reason of such actively employed executive making the same change
in level of coverage or coverage options.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that the Executive  becomes  reemployed with another  employer and becomes
eligible to receive welfare  benefits form such employer,  the Welfare  Benefits
described  herein shall be secondary  to such  benefits,  but only to the extent
that  the  Company  reimburses  him for any  increased  cost  and  provides  any
additional  benefits  necessary  to  give  him  the  Welfare  Benefits  provided
hereunder.

                  3.2.3   OUTSTANDING   AWARDS.   If  an  Executive's   Date  of
Termination  occurs  within the  Coverage  Period and during any  calendar  year
following the calendar year during which a Change in Control occurs, he shall be
entitled to a lump sum cash payment with respect to each outstanding  contingent
target AIP and PSU grant under the KEIP or any similar types of grants under any
replacement plans or programs equal to the sum of :

                                       15
<PAGE>

                        3.2.3.1    the sum of the product of (x) and (y)for
each then  outstanding  contingent  target PSU grant  under the KEIP (or similar
types of grants under any replacement  plan or program) for the applicable award
period that  includes his Date of  Termination,  where (x) is an amount equal to
the 100% target award amount of such outstanding contingent target PSU grant and
(y) is a  fraction  the  numerator  of  which  is the  number  of days  from and
including  the first  day of the award  period  applicable  to such  outstanding
contingent  target PSU grant that includes the  Executive's  Date of Termination
until (and  including) his Date of Termination  and the  denominator of which is
the number of days in the award period applicable to such outstanding contingent
target PSU grant; and

                           3.2.3.2    the sum of the product of (x) and (y) for
each then outstanding contingent target AIP grant made to him under the KEIP (or
similar  types of  grants  under  any  replacement  plans or  programs)  for the
applicable  award period that includes his Date of Termination,  where (x) is an
amount  equal  to the  greater  of (A) the  100%  target  award  amount  of such
outstanding contingent target AIP grant, and (B) the amount that would have been
payable  to him  under  such  contingent  target  AIP grant as of the end of the
applicable  award period,  calculated  utilizing as the  applicable  performance
factors his and the Company's  actual  performance on an annualized  basis as of
his Date of  Termination,  and (y) is a fraction  the  numerator of which is the
number of days from and including  the first day of the award period  applicable
to such  outstanding  contingent AIP grant that includes his Date of Termination
until (and  including) his Date of Termination  and the  denominator of which is
the number of days in such applicable award period.

Contingent  target PSU grants  under the KEIP or a similar type of grant under a
replacement  plan or program shall be valued at the highest closing price of the
Company's  Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the period running
from sixty (60) days prior to the Change in Control until the  Executive's  Date
of Termination.

                  3.2.4  RELOCATION  ALLOWANCE.  In the event that an  Executive
relocates  following his Date of Termination  and during the Coverage  Period at
the request of a successor  employer,  the Company shall pay to him a relocation
allowance of $75,000; provided,  however, that any such payment shall be reduced
by any payments received by him from such successor  employer for the purpose of
reimbursing  him for  costs  of  relocation.  The  Company  shall  pay him  such
relocation allowance within five (5) business days after delivery of his written
request and may  condition  the  payment of the  relocation  allowance  upon his
agreeing  in  writing  to  report  to the  Company  any such  payments  from any
successor  employer  and  agreeing  in writing to  reimburse  to the Company any
amounts  received from the Company pursuant to this Subsection 3.2.4 that should
have been so reduced.

         3.3      GROSS-UP  PAYMENT.  In the event that an Executive becomes
entitled to the Severance  Benefits or any other benefits or payments under this
Plan (other than  pursuant to this  Section  3.3),  or the KEIP by reason of the
accelerated   vesting  of  stock  options  thereunder   (together,   the  "Total
Benefits"),  and in the event that any of the Total  Benefits will be subject to
the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to him an additional amount (the "Gross-Up
Payment")  such that the net amount  retained  by him,  after  deduction  of any
Excise Tax on the Total Benefits

                                       16
<PAGE>

and any federal,  state and local  income tax,  Excise Tax and FICA and Medicare
withholding  taxes upon the payment  provided for by this Section 3.3,  shall be
equal to the Total Benefits.


         For purposes of  determining  whether any of the Total Benefits will be
subject  to the  Excise Tax and the  amount of such  Excise  Tax,  (i) any other
payments or benefits  received or to be received by an Executive  in  connection
with a Change in Control or his termination of employment  (whether  pursuant to
the terms of this Plan or any other  plan,  arrangement  or  agreement  with the
Company,  any Person whose  actions  result in a Change in Control or any Person
affiliated  with the  Company or such  Person)  shall be  treated  as  parachute
payments  within the meaning of Section  280G(b)(2) of the Code,  and all excess
parachute  payments within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as
subject to the Excise Tax,  unless in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel")
selected by the Company's  independent auditors and acceptable to the Executive,
such  other  payments  or  benefits  (in  whole or in  part)  do not  constitute
parachute  payments,  or such excess  parachute  payments  (in whole or in part)
represent  reasonable  compensation  for services  actually  rendered within the
meaning of Section  280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the Base Amount,  or are
otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax,  (ii) the amount of the Total  Benefits
which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser
of (A) the total  amount of the Total  Benefits  reduced  by the  amount of such
Total Benefits that in the opinion of Tax Counsel are not parachute payments, or
(B) the  amount of excess  parachute  payments  within  the  meaning  of Section
280G(b)(1)  (after  applying  clause  (i),  above),  and  (iii) the value of any
non-cash  benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the
Company's  independent  auditors in accordance  with the  principles of Sections
280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.  For purposes of  determining  the amount of the
Gross-Up  Payment,  an Executive  shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at
the highest  marginal  rate of federal  income  taxation in the calendar year in
which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the
highest  marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of his residence on
the Date of  Termination,  net of the  reduction  in federal  income taxes which
could be obtained from  deduction of such state and local taxes  (calculated  by
assuming  that any  reduction  under  Section  68 of the Code in the  amount  of
itemized deductions  allowable to him applies first to reduce the amount of such
state and local income taxes that would otherwise be deductible by him).

         In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently  determined to be less
than the amount taken into account  hereunder at the time of  termination  of an
Executive's  employment,  he shall  repay to the  Company,  at the time that the
amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the
Gross-Up  Payment  attributable  to such  reduction  (plus  that  portion of the
Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax, federal, state and local income
taxes and FICA and  Medicare  withholding  taxes  imposed on the  portion of the
Gross-Up  Payment being repaid by him to the extent that such repayment  results
in a  reduction  in Excise  Tax,  FICA and  Medicare  withholding  taxes  and/or
federal,  state or local  income  taxes)  plus  interest  on the  amount of such
repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. The Company
may require an Executive to agree in writing to the repayment obligation imposed
by the preceding  sentence as a condition to receiving the Gross-Up Payment.  In
the event  that the  Excise Tax is  determined  to exceed the amount  taken into
account  hereunder at the time of the  termination of an Executive's  employment
(including  by reason of any payment the  existence or amount of which cannot be
determined  at the time of the  Gross-Up  Payment),  the  Company  shall

                                       17
<PAGE>

make an additional Gross-Up Payment,  determined as previously described, to him
in respect of such excess (plus any interest,  penalties or additions payable by
him with  respect to such  excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is
finally determined.

         3.4      TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  The payments provided for:


                  3.4.1 in Subsections 3.1.1, 3.1.3, 3.1.5, 3.2.1 and 3.2.3, and
in Section  3.3 hereof  shall be made to an  Executive  not later than the fifth
(5th) day  following his Date of  Termination;  provided,  however,  that if the
amounts of such payments cannot be finally  determined on or before such day the
Company  shall pay to the  Executive on such day an estimate,  as  determined in
good faith by the Company,  of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay
the remainder of such payments  (together  with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following the Date of
Termination to the payment of such  remainder) as soon as the amount thereof can
be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Date
of Termination.  In the event that the amount of the estimated  payments exceeds
the  amount  subsequently  determined  to  have  been  due,  such  excess  shall
constitute  a loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)
business day after  demand by the Company  (together  with  interest at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following
the Date of Termination to the payment of such remainder);

                  3.4.2 in Subsection 3.1.4 hereof shall be made to an Executive
on the later of (i) the first day of  January of the year  first  following  the
year  during  which  his Date of  Termination  occurs  and (ii) the one  hundred
twentieth  (120th) day following his Date of Termination if prior to his Date of
Termination he elects, in his sole discretion,  to receive his previously unpaid
Deferred AIP Awards at such time. In the event the Executive makes such election
and the amount of the payment  described in  Subsection  3.1.4 cannot be finally
determined on or before the later of such one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or
January 1, as  applicable,  the Company  shall pay to the  Executive on such one
hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  an  estimate,  as
determined in good faith by the Company,  of the minimum  amount of such payment
and shall pay the remainder of such payment  (together with interest at the rate
provided in Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the Code from such one hundred  twentieth
(120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  to the payment of such  remainder) as
soon as the amount  thereof  can be  determined  but in no event  later than the
thirtieth (30th) day after such one hundred  twentieth (120th) day or January 1,
as applicable. In the event that the amount of the estimated payment exceeds the
amount subsequently  determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)  business day
after  demand by the Company  (together  with  interest at the rate  provided in
Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the Code from the one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day
following the Date of Termination or January 1, as applicable, to the payment of
such  remainder).  In the  event  the  Executive  makes  no such  election,  his
previously  unpaid  Deferred AIP Awards shall be paid in accordance with each of
his applicable Deferral Elections;

                  3.4.3 in Subsection 3.1.6 shall be made to an Executive on the
later of (i) the first  day of  January  of the year  first  following  the year
during which his Date of Termination  occurs and (ii) the one hundred  twentieth
(120th)  day  following  his  Date  of  Termination  if  prior

                                       18
<PAGE>


to his Date of Termination  he elects,  in his sole  discretion,  to receive his
previously  unpaid  Deferred PSU Awards at such time. In the event the Executive
makes such  election and the amount of the payment  provided  for in  Subsection
3.1.6  cannot be finally  determined  on or before the later of such one hundred
twentieth (120th) day or January 1, as applicable,  the Company shall pay to the
Executive on such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or January 1, as applicable,
an estimate,  as determined in good faith by the Company,  of the minimum amount
of such  payment and shall pay the  remainder  of such  payment  (together  with
interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from such one
hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  to the payment of
such  remainder) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event
later than the thirtieth (30th) day after such one hundred  twentieth (120th day
or January  1, as  applicable.  In the event  that the  amount of the  estimated
payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess
shall  constitute a loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth
(5th)  business day after demand by the Company  (together  with interest at the
rate  provided  in  Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the  Code  from  the one  hundred
twentieth  (120th)  day  following  the Date of  Termination  or  January  1, as
applicable,  to the payment of such remainder). In the event the Executive makes
no such  election,  his previously  unpaid  Deferred PSU Awards shall be paid in
accordance with each of his applicable Deferral Elections; and

                  3.4.4 in Subsection 3.1.7 shall be made to him on the later of
(i) the first day of January  following his Date of Termination and (ii) the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day following his Date of Termination if, prior to his
Date of Termination,  he elects, in his sole discretion, to receive such payment
at such time. In the event the Executive makes no such election, then his Vested
Pension Amount shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5.

         3.5      REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL COSTS. The Company shall pay to an
Executive  all  legal  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by  him as a  result  of a
termination of his employment which entitles him to any payments under this Plan
(including  all such  fees and  expenses,  if any,  incurred  in  contesting  or
disputing  any  Notice of Intent to  Terminate  under  Section  4.3 hereof or in
seeking to obtain or enforce  any right or benefit  provided  by this Plan or in
connection  with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent  attributable  to the
application  of Section  4999 of the Code to any  payment  or  benefit  provided
hereunder).  Such  payments  shall be made within five (5)  business  days after
delivery of his  respective  written  requests for payment  accompanied  by such
evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require.

         3.6     EXECUTIVES' COVENANT.  The Company may condition the payment
of the amounts and provision of the benefits  described in Article 3 of the Plan
to an  Executive  upon his  providing to the Company a written  agreement  that,
subject to the terms and  conditions  of this Plan,  in the event of a Potential
Change in  Control,  he will  remain  in the  employ  of the  Company  until the
earliest  of (a) a date which is nine  months  after the date of such  Potential
Change  in  Control,  (b) the date of a Change in  Control,  (c) the date of his
termination  of his  employment  for Good Reason  (determined  by  treating  the
Potential  Change in Control for this purpose as a Change in Control in applying
the  definition  of Good  Reason) or by reason of death or  Disability,  (d) the
termination by the Company of his employment for any reason or (e) his attaining
age sixty-five (65).

                           TERMINATION PROCEDURES AND
                           COMPENSATION DURING DISPUTE

         4.1      NOTICE OF  INTENT TO  TERMINATE.  After a Change in  Control,
any purported termination of an Executive's  employment (other than by reason of
death) must be preceded by a written  Notice of Intent to Terminate  from him to
the Company or the Company to him, as  applicable,  in  accordance  with Section
8.17 hereof.  For  purposes of this Plan, a Notice of Intent to Terminate  shall
mean a notice which shall indicate the notifying  party's opinion  regarding the
specific provisions of this Plan that will apply upon such termination and shall
set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances  claimed to provide a
basis for the application of the provisions so indicated.  Further,  a Notice of
Intent to Terminate for Cause is required to include a copy of a resolution duly
adopted by the  affirmative  vote of not less than  three-quarters  (3/4) of the
entire  membership  of the Board at a meeting of the Board  which was called and
held for the purpose of considering such termination (after reasonable notice to
the Executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard
before the Board)  finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board,  he was
guilty of conduct set forth in Subsection 1.6.1 or 1.6.2 herein,  and specifying
the particulars thereof in detail.

         4.2      DATE OF  TERMINATION.  Date of  Termination,  with  respect to
any  purported  termination  of an  Executive's  employment  after a  Change  in
Control,  shall mean  (except as  provided  in Section  4.3  hereof)  (a) if his
employment is  terminated  by reason of his death,  his date of death (b) if his
employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Intent
to Terminate is given (provided that he shall not have returned to the full-time
performance  of his duties  during such thirty (30) day period),  and (c) if his
employment is terminated for any other reason,  the date specified in the Notice
of Intent to Terminate  (which (i) in the case of a termination  by the Company,
shall not be less than thirty (30) days, except in the case of a termination for
Cause in which case it shall not be less than ten (10) days,  provided  that the
Company  may  require  him to not report to work during such ten (10) day period
and (ii) in the case of a termination  by an  Executive,  shall not be less than
fifteen  (15) days nor more than sixty (60)  days,  respectively,  from the date
such Notice of Intent to Terminate is given).

         4.3      DISPUTE CONCERNING  TERMINATION.  If within fifteen (15) days
after any Notice of Intent to Terminate is given  (within  eight (8) days in the
case of a termination for Cause by the Company), or, if later, prior to the Date
of Termination  (as  determined  without regard to this Section 4.3), the person
receiving  such Notice of Intent to Terminate  notifies  the person  giving such
notice that a dispute  exists  concerning  the  termination or the provisions of
this Plan that apply to such  termination,  the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which  the  dispute  is  finally  resolved,  either  by  mutual  written
agreement of the parties to such dispute or by a final judgment, order or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
which  the  time  for  appeal  therefrom  has  expired  and no  appeal  has been
perfected); provided, however, that the Date of Termination shall be extended by
a notice of  dispute  only if such  notice is given in good faith and the person
giving such notice  pursues  the  resolution  of such  dispute  with  reasonable
diligence.

         4.4      COMPENSATION  DURING  DISPUTE.  If a purported  termination of
an  Executive's  employment  occurs  following  a  Change  in  Control  and such
termination or the  provisions of this Plan that apply upon such  termination is
disputed in  accordance  with Section 4.3 hereof  (including a dispute as to the
existence of good faith and/or  reasonable  diligence  thereunder),  the Company
shall continue to pay the Executive the full  compensation  (including,  but not
limited to, salary) at his Annual Base Salary and continue his  participation in
all  compensation  plans  required to be  maintained  hereunder  and continue to
provide to him the Welfare  Benefits  provided  for in  Subsection  3.2.2 hereof
until the dispute is finally  resolved in  accordance  with  Section 4.3 hereof.
Amounts  paid under this  Section 4.4 are in  addition to all other  amounts due
under this Plan (other than those due under  Subsection  3.1.1 hereof) and shall
not be offset against or reduce any other amounts due under this Plan.

         5.1      AUTHORITY  TO  PLAN  ADMINISTRATOR.   The  Plan  shall  be
interpreted, administered and operated by the Plan Administrator, subject to the
express provisions of the Plan.

         5.2      DELEGATION  OF DUTIES.  The Plan  Administrator  may delegate
any of his duties  hereunder  to such person or persons  from time to time as he

empowered, on behalf of the Plan, to engage accountants,  legal counsel and such
other  personnel  as he  deems  necessary  or  advisable  to  assist  him in the
performance  of his duties  under the Plan.  The  functions  of any such persons
engaged by the Plan Administrator shall be limited to the specified services and
duties for which they are engaged,  and such persons shall have no other duties,
obligations or  responsibilities  under the Plan. Such persons shall exercise no
discretionary  authority or discretionary  control  respecting the management of
the Plan. All reasonable expenses thereof shall be borne by the Company.

                                     CLAIMS

         6.1      CLAIMS PROCEDURE. Claims for benefits under the Plan shall be
filed with the Plan Administrator.  If any Executive or other payee claims to be
entitled to a benefit under the Plan and the Plan Administrator  determines that
such claim should be denied in whole or in part,  the Plan  Administrator  shall
notify such person of its decision in writing. Such notification will be written
in a manner  calculated  to be  understood  by such person and will  contain (a)
specific  reasons for the denial,  (b)  specific  reference  to  pertinent  Plan
provisions,  (c)  a  description  of  any  additional  material  or  information
necessary for such person to perfect such claim and an  explanation  of why such
material or information is necessary,  and (d) information as to the steps to be
taken if the person  wishes to submit a request  for review.  Such  notification
will  be  given  within  90  days  after  the  claim  is  received  by the  Plan
Administrator.  If such notification is not

                                       21
<PAGE>


given within such period, the claim will be considered denied as of the last day
of such period and such person may request a review of his claim.

         6.2      REVIEW  PROCEDURE.  Within 60 days after the date on which a
person receives a written notice of a denied claim (or, if applicable, within 60
days after the date on which such denial is  considered to have  occurred)  such
person (or his duly  authorized  representative)  may (a) file a written request
with the Plan  Administrator  for a review of his denied  claim and of pertinent
documents and (b) submit written issues and comments to the Plan  Administrator.
The Plan Administrator will notify such person of its decision in writing.  Such
notification  will be written in a manner  calculated  to be  understood by such
person and will  contain  specific  reasons for the decision as well as specific
references  to pertinent  Plan  provisions.  The decision on review will be made
within  60  days  after  the   request  for  review  is  received  by  the  Plan
Administrator.  If the  decision on review is not made within such  period,  the
claim will be considered denied.

         6.3      CLAIMS AND REVIEW  PROCEDURES NOT MANDATORY.  The claims
procedure and review  procedure  provided for in this Article 6 are provided for
the use and benefit of  Executives  who may choose to use such  procedures,  but
compliance  with the  provisions  of this  Article  6 is not  mandatory  for any
Executive  claiming  benefits  under the Plan. It shall not be necessary for any
Executive  to file a  claim  with  the  Plan  Administrator  or to  exhaust  the
procedures  and  remedies  provided  for by this Article 6 prior to bringing any
legal claim or action,  or  asserting  any other  demand,  for payments or other
benefits to which he claims entitlement hereunder.

                        PLAN MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION

         The Plan may be amended or terminated by resolution of the Board at any
time; provided,  however, that: (a) Schedule I hereto may be amended at any time
and in any manner by resolution of the Compensation  Committee of the Board upon
recommendation  of the Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer;  and (b) Schedule I
hereto may be amended at any time by the Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer to
delete any one or more persons therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the
Plan may not be  terminated  or amended in a manner  adverse to the interests of
any Executive, without his consent (including the amendment of Schedule I hereto
to delete him therefrom) (i) after a Potential  Change in Control occurs and for
one (1) year following the cessation of a Potential  Change in Control,  or (ii)
for the two-year period following  consummation of the transaction(s)  resulting
from or in the  Change  in  Control;  and  (b) no  termination  of this  Plan or
amendment hereof in a manner adverse to the interests of any Executive,  without
his  consent  (including  the  amendment  of  Schedule  I hereto to  delete  him
therefrom),  shall be effective if such  termination or amendment  occurs (i) at
the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect
a Change in Control or (ii) in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control or Potential  Change in Control.  For this  purpose,  the cessation of a
Potential  Change in  Control  occurs if a Change in  Control  has not  occurred
within one year following the Potential Change in Control. In the event that the
termination  of this  Plan by the  Company  or an  amendment  hereof in a manner
adverse to the  interests of any Executive  (without his consent)  occurs within
six (6) months  prior to a  Potential

                                       22
<PAGE>

Change in Control or a Change in Control,  there shall be a presumption that the
conditions  of  subclauses  (i) and (ii) of  clause  (b) of the  next  preceding
sentence  shall have been met. Upon the expiration of the Coverage  Period,  the
Plan may not be amended in any manner  which would  adversely  affect the rights
which any Executive has at that time to receive any and all payments or benefits
pursuant  to  Articles  2, 3, and 4 by reason of a Change in  Control  which has
theretofore  occurred or by reason of a termination of his employment during the
Coverage Period, and the Company's obligations to make such payments and provide
such benefits shall survive any termination of the Plan.


                                    ARTICLE 8
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         8.1      TERMINATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF CHANGE IN CONTROL.  An
Executive's  employment  shall be deemed to have been  terminated by the Company
without Cause during the Coverage  Period if his employment is terminated by the
Company  without  Cause  prior to a Change in  Control  or  Potential  Change in
Control and such  termination  of  employment  (a) was at the request of a third
party who had  indicated  an  intention  to take or had taken  steps  reasonably
calculated to effect a Change in Control,  or (b) otherwise  arose in connection
with or in  anticipation of a Change in Control and (c) in either case, a Change
in Control does occur which may involve  such third party (or a party  competing
with such third party to effectuate a Change in Control).  An Executive shall be
deemed to have  terminated  his  employment  for Good Reason during the Coverage
Period if he  terminates  his  employment  with Good Reason prior to a Change in
Control  or  Potential  Change in  Control if the  circumstance  or event  which
constitutes  Good  Reason (a)  occurred  at the request of a third party who had
indicated  an  intention  to take or had taken steps  reasonably  calculated  to
effect a Change in Control,  or (b)  otherwise  arose in  connection  with or in
anticipation of a Change in Control, and (c) in either case, a Change in Control
does occur which may involve  such third party (or a party  competing  with such
third party to effectuate a Change in Control). In the event of a termination of
employment described in this Section 8.1, the Executive shall be entitled to all
payments  and  other  benefits  to which he would  have been  entitled  had such
termination  occurred  during the Coverage Period (other than salary pursuant to
Subsection 3.1.1 hereof for any period after the actual date of termination) and
he  shall  be  entitled  to an  additional  payment  in an  amount  which  shall
compensate  him to the extent that he was  deprived by such  termination  of the
opportunity  prior to  termination  of  employment to exercise any stock options
granted to him under the KEIP  (including  any such stock  options that were not
exercisable at the time of his  termination of employment) at the highest market
price of the Company's  Common Stock  reached in  connection  with the Change in
Control or Potential  Change in Control if a Potential  Change in Control  shall
occur and not be  followed by a Change in Control  within  twelve (12) months of
the Potential Change in Control. In the event that the termination of employment
of an Executive  as  described in this Section 8.1 occurs  following a Potential
Change in Control or within six (6) months  prior to a Change in Control,  there
shall be a  presumption  that clauses (a) and (b) of the first two  sentences of
this Section 8.1 shall have been met.

         8.2      BURDEN.  In  any  proceeding  (regardless  of who  initiates
such   proceeding)  in  which  the  payment  of  Severance   Benefits  or  other
compensation or benefits under this Plan is at issue,

                                       23
<PAGE>

(i) the burden of proof as to whether  Cause  exists for  purposes  of this Plan
shall be upon  the  Company  and (ii) in the  event  that the last  sentence  of
Section 8.1 applies,  the Company  shall have the burden to prove,  by clear and
convincing  evidence,  that a  termination  of  employment  has not been made in
anticipation of a Change in Control as contemplated by Section 8.1.

         8.3      NO RIGHT TO  CONTINUED  EMPLOYMENT.  Nothing  in the Plan
shall be deemed to give any  Executive the right to be retained in the employ of
the Company,  or to interfere  with the right of the Company to discharge him at
any time and for any lawful reason, with or without notice, subject in all cases
to the terms of this Plan.

         8.4      NO ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS.  Except as otherwise  provided
herein or by law, no right or interest of any Executive  under the Plan shall be
assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, either directly or by operation
of  law  or  otherwise,   including  without  limitation  by  execution,   levy,
garnishment,  attachment,  pledge or in any manner;  no attempted  assignment or
transfer  thereof shall be effective;  and no right or interest of any Executive
under the Plan shall be liable for, or subject to, any  obligation  or liability
of such Executive.

         8.5      DEATH.  This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable  by an  Executive's  personal or legal  representatives,  executors,
administrators,  successors,  heirs, distributees,  devisees and legatees. If an
Executive  shall die while any amount  would  still be payable to him  hereunder
(other than amounts which,  by their terms,  terminate upon his death) if he had
continued to live, all such amounts,  unless otherwise provided herein, shall be
paid in  accordance  with the  terms  of this  Plan to the  executors,  personal
representatives or administrators of his estate.

         8.6      INCOMPETENCY.  Any  benefit  payable  to or for the  benefit
of an  Executive,  if  legally  incompetent  or  incapable  of  giving a receipt
therefor,  shall be  deemed  paid  when  paid to his  guardian  or to the  party
providing  or  reasonably  appearing  to provide for his care,  and such payment
shall fully discharge the Company,  the Plan Administrator and all other parties
with respect thereto.

         8.7      REDUCTION OF BENEFITS BY LEGALLY REQUIRED BENEFITS.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Company
is obligated by law or by contract (other than under this Plan) to pay severance
pay, a termination indemnity, notice pay, or the like, to an Executive or if the
Company  is  obligated  by law or by  contract  to  provide  advance  notice  of
separation  ("Notice  Period")  to an  Executive,  then any  Severance  Benefits
payable to him  hereunder  shall be reduced by the amount of any such  severance
pay, termination  indemnity,  notice pay or the like, as applicable,  and by the
amount of any pay received during any Notice Period;  provided however, that the
period  following  a Notice of Intent to  Terminate  shall not be  considered  a
Notice Period.

         8.8      ENFORCEABILITY.  If any provision of the Plan shall be held
invalid or unenforceable,  such invalidity or unenforceability  shall not affect
any other provisions  hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if
such provisions had not been included.

                                       24
<PAGE>

         8.9      EFFECTIVE  DATE.  The Plan shall be effective as of the
Effective  Date and shall remain in effect  unless and until  terminated  by the
Board, subject to the requirements of Article 7 hereof.

         8.10     NO  MITIGATION.  The  Company  agrees that, if an  Executive's
employment  by the  Company  is  terminated  during  the  Coverage  Period,  the
Executive is not required to seek other  employment  or to attempt in any way to
reduce any amounts payable to him by the Company pursuant to this Plan. Further,
the amount of any payment or benefit provided for under this Plan (other than to
the extent provided in Subsections  3.2.2 and 3.2.4) shall not be reduced by any
compensation  earned by him as a result of  employment by another  employer,  by
retirement  benefits,  by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by him to
the Company, or otherwise.

         8.11     SUCCESSORS. In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon
any  successor  to the  Company,  the Company  shall be obligated to require any
successor  (whether  direct or  indirect,  by purchase,  merger,  consolidation,
operation  of law, or  otherwise)  to all or  substantially  all of the business
and/or  assets of the  Company to  expressly  assume  and agree to  perform  the
Company's  obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company  would be required to perform  them if no such  succession  had
taken  place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such  assumption  and  agreement
prior to the  effectiveness  of any such succession shall entitle each Executive
to compensation and benefits from the Company in the same amount and on the same
terms  as he  would  be  entitled  to  hereunder  if he  were to  terminate  his
employment for Good Reason during the Coverage Period.

         8.12   CONSENT TO CANCELLATION OF AWARDS AND REDUCTION OF SERP BENEFIT.
The Company may  condition  the payment to an  Executive  of his Vested  Current
Bonus Amount,  Vested  Current PSU Amount,  Vested  Deferred Bonus Amount and/or
Vested  Deferred  PSU  Amount  upon  his  providing  a  written  consent  to the
cancellation of the applicable  contingent target AIP and PSU grants and AIP and
PSU Awards for which payment has been deferred on which his Vested Current Bonus
Amount,  Vested Current PSU Amount,  Vested  Deferred Bonus Amount and/or Vested
Deferred  PSU Amount is based and in lieu of which such  amounts  are paid.  The
Company may condition the payment to an Executive of his Vested  Pension  Amount

                  permitted  to  exercise  any  currently outstanding  Options
                  granted to him  previously  under the KEIP unless and until

                  If this Agreement  becomes  effective and enforceable,  then
                  from and after the Effective Date and through and including
                  his Separation  Date,  Employee shall be  considered  to
                  be an active  employee for purposes of any Options  granted to
                  him  previously under KEIP during any years  prior to 2001
                  and may exercise in accordance  with the  provisions of
                  KEIP any such  Options at any time prior to his  Separation
                  Date and  thereafter  in  accordance with the KEIP and
                  the terms and conditions of the grants of such Options if his

                  he is eligible to retire.

        4.5.      Employee shall be eligible to receive an award, if any, of his
                  contingent  target  grant for 2000 under the Annual  Incentive
                  Program ("AIP") of KEIP subject to the terms and conditions of
                  the KEIP and the contingent  target grant.  For these purposes
                  his  score  for  personal  objectives  will  be set  at  100%.
                  Employee  shall not be entitled to  participate  in or receive
                  any benefits  under the Annual  Incentive  Program of KEIP for
                  2001 or any subsequent year.

        4.6.      During the Leave of Absence  Period,  Employee shall have no
                  assigned duties and shall perform no services for the Company.

        4.7.      Except as provided for in Section 6 below, Employee shall be

                  date of such health insurance  received from the other
                  employer. Nothing herein shall obligate Employee to
                  accept any health insurance  benefit associated with any other
                  employment. Employee shall not,  however, accept coverage from
                  BOTH the Company and a new employer.

        4.9.      If  Employee  commences  full-time   employment  with  another
                  employer  prior to June 1,  2002,  he shall be  entitled  to a

                           and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act.

         7.2.     Employee  acknowledges  and agrees that other than to seek the
                  Company's  performance  under this Agreement he is waiving all
                  rights to sue or obtain  equitable,  remedial or punitive
                  relief from any or all Releasees of any kind whatsoever,
                  including, without limitation,  reinstatement, back pay,
                  front pay, attorneys' fees and any form of injunctive  relief.
                  Employee  acknowledges  and agrees  that this  waiver
                  and  release  is an  essential  and  material  term of this
                  Agreement. Employee  further  acknowledges  and agrees that he
                  will not assert any breach of any  agreement,plan, or right
                  referred to herein based on any action or inaction of the
                  Releasees  prior to the date hereof.

         7.3.     Employee   understands   and  intends   that  this  SECTION  7
                  constitutes a general release,  and that no reference  therein
                  to a  specific  form of  claim,  statute  or type of relief is
                  intended  to limit  the  scope  of such  general  release  and
                  waiver; provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision
                  of this Section 7, the  provisions of this Section 7 shall not
                  apply  to  any  rights   Employee   may  have  under  the  Age
                  Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended.

         7.4.     Employee  expressly  waives all rights afforded by any statute
                  which  limits the effect of a release  with respect to unknown
                  claims.  Employee  understands the significance of his release
                  of  unknown  claims  and his  waiver of  statutory  protection
                  against a release of unknown claims.

         7.5.     Employee  agrees that he will not be entitled to or accept any
                  benefit from any claim or proceeding  within the scope of this
                  SECTION 7 general  release that is filed or  instigated by him
                  or on his behalf  with any agency,  court or other  government
                  entity.

8.  EMPLOYEE'S   REPRESENTATIONS  AND  COVENANTS  REGARDING  ACTIONS.   Employee
represents,  warrants  and  covenants to each of the  Releasees  that at no time
prior to or contemporaneous with his execution of this Agreement has he filed or
caused or knowingly permitted the filing or maintenance,  in any state,  federal
or foreign court, or before any local, state, federal or foreign  administrative
agency or other tribunal,  any charge,  claim or action of any kind,  nature and
character  whatsoever  ("CLAIM"),  known or unknown,  suspected or  unsuspected,
which he may now have or has ever had  against the  Releasees  which is based in
whole or in part on any matter  referred to in SECTION 7.1.  above,  and, to the
maximum  extent   permitted  by  law  Employee  is  prohibited  from  filing  or
maintaining,  or causing or knowingly  permitting the filing or maintaining,  of
any such  Claim in any such  forum.  Employee  hereby  grants  the  Company  his
perpetual and irrevocable  limited power of attorney with full right,  power and
authority to take all actions  necessary to dismiss or discharge any such Claim.
Employee  further  covenants and agrees that he will not encourage any person or
entity,  including but not limited to any current or former  employee,  officer,
director or  stockholder  of the  Company,  to institute  any Claim  against


                                       5
<PAGE>


the Releasees or any of them,  and that except as expressly  permitted by law or
administrative  policy or as required by legally  enforceable  order he will not
aid or assist any such person or entity in prosecuting such Claim.

9. NO DISPARAGING  REMARKS.  Employee hereby  covenants to each of the Releasees
and agrees  that he shall not,  directly  or  indirectly,  within or without the
Company,  make or solicit or encourage others to make or solicit any disparaging
or negative  remarks  concerning  the Releasees (as defined in SECTION 7 of this
Agreement),  or any of  their  products,  services,  businesses  or  activities.
Employee  understands that, in addition to the consequences such breach may have
under other  provisions of this Agreement,  his breach of this SECTION 9 and the
Company's  delivery  to him  of  notice  of  such  breach  shall  result  in his
Separation;  shall  eliminate  his  entitlement  to any  subsequent  payment  or
benefits under this Agreement including, without limitation, to further exercise
any Options under the KEIP and any further  participation  in or eligibility for
benefits  under the SERP;  and shall  subject him to  liability  for any damages
arising from such remarks.

10. NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  Employee hereby covenants and agrees that he shall
not, directly or indirectly,  incur any obligation or commitment,  or enter into
any  contract,  agreement  or  understanding,  whether  express or implied,  and
whether  written  or oral,  which  would be in  conflict  with his  obligations,
covenants   or   agreements   hereunder   or  which   could  cause  any  of  his
representations or warranties made herein to be untrue or inaccurate.

11.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  The  Company  and  Employee  agree  that  the  terms  and
conditions  of this  Agreement  are to be  strictly  confidential,  except  that
Employee  may  disclose  the  terms and  conditions  to his  family,  attorneys,
accountants,  tax  consultants,  state and  federal  tax  authorities  or as may
otherwise be required by law. The Company may disclose the terms and  conditions
of this Agreement and the circumstances of Employee's  separation as the Company
deems  necessary or  appropriate to its or its  affiliates' or  representatives'
officers, employees, board of directors, insurers, attorneys, accountants, state
and federal tax authorities, or as otherwise allowed by law. Employee represents
that except as expressly authorized by this SECTION 11 he has not discussed, and
agrees that except as expressly  authorized by this SECTION 11 or by the Company
he will not discuss, this Agreement or the circumstances of his Separation,  and
that he will take  affirmative  steps to avoid or absent  himself  from any such
discussion  even  if  he  is  not  an  active  participant   therein.   EMPLOYEE
ACKNOWLEDGES  THE  SIGNIFICANCE  AND  MATERIALITY  OF  THIS  PROVISION  TO  THIS
AGREEMENT, AND HIS UNDERSTANDING THEREOF.

12. RETURN OF CORPORATE  PROPERTY;  CONVEYANCE OF  INFORMATION.  Employee hereby
covenants and agrees to immediately return all documents, keys, ID cards, credit
cards (without further use thereof),  laptop computer, and all other items which
are the property of the Company and/or which contain  confidential  information;
and, in the case of  documents,  to return any and all materials of any kind and
in whatever medium evidenced, including, without limitation, all hard disk drive
data,  diskettes,  microfiche,   photographs,   negatives,  blueprints,  printed
materials, tape recordings and videotapes.

13.  REMEDIES.  In the event that  Employee has  breached any of his  covenants,
agreements  or  obligations  under this  Agreement,  the  Company  shall  notify
Employee in writing at his home address as shown in the Company's records of the
reason for such  determination.  The notice  shall be sent via hand  delivery or
overnight courier. Employee hereby acknowledges and affirms that in the event of
any breach by  Employee  of any of his  covenants,  agreements  and  obligations
hereunder,  Employee's  Separation  shall be effective as of the day the Company
provides notice thereof.  Employee further hereby  acknowledges and affirms that
in the event of such breach  monetary  damages would be inadequate to compensate
the Releasees or any of them.  Accordingly,  in addition to other remedies which
may be  available to the  Releasees  hereunder or otherwise at law or in equity,
any  Releasee  shall  be  entitled  to  specifically   enforce  such


                                       6
<PAGE>


covenants,  obligations and  restrictions  through  injunctive  and/or equitable
relief,  in each case  without  the posting of any bond or other  security  with
respect  thereto.  Should any provision hereof be adjudged to any extent invalid
by any court or tribunal of  competent  jurisdiction,  each  provision  shall be
deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to render it enforceable.

14.  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  OF VOLUNTARY  AGREEMENT.  Employee hereby  acknowledges and
affirms  that he is entering  into this  Agreement  knowingly  and  voluntarily,
without  coercion or duress of any sort,  in order to receive the  payments  and
other consideration from the Company as set forth herein.  Employee acknowledges
and affirms that he has been given  adequate  opportunity to review and consider
this Agreement.

15. COMPLETE  AGREEMENT;  INCONSISTENCIES.  This Agreement and the Participation
and Arbitration  Agreement  constitute the complete and entire agreement between
Employee  and the  Company  with  respect  to the  subject  matter  hereof,  and
supersede  in their  entirety  any and all  prior  understandings,  commitments,
obligations and/or agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto; it
being understood and agreed that this Agreement and those agreements,  including
the mutual covenants,  agreements,  acknowledgments  and affirmations  contained
herein and  therein,  are  intended  to  constitute  a complete  settlement  and

mutual  intent,  and no doctrine of strict  construction  shall be applied
against any Party.

them in  accordance  with the terms  hereof in respect of the rights  granted to
such  Releasees  hereunder.  Except and to the extent set forth in the preceding
sentence,  this  Agreement  is not  intended for the benefit of any person other
than the  Parties,  and no such other person shall be deemed to be a third party

dealing or plan of  general  application  for the  benefit  of or  otherwise  in
respect of any other employee, officer, director or stockholder, irrespective of
any  similarity  between any contract,  agreement,  commitment or  understanding
between the Company and such other employee,  officer,  director or stockholder,
on the one  hand,  and any  contract,  agreement,  commitment  or  understanding
between the Company and Employee,  on the other hand,  and  irrespective  of any
similarity in facts or  circumstances  involving such other  employee,  officer,
director or stockholder, on the one hand, and the Employee, on the other hand.

Company shall be entitled to withhold from any  amounts  otherwise  payable
hereunder  to  Employee  any  amounts  required to be withheld in respect of
federal, state or local taxes.

validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by,

without  giving  effect  to any  choice  of  law or  conflict  of law  rules  or
provisions   (whether  of  the   Commonwealth   of  Pennsylvania  or  any  other
jurisdiction)  that  would  cause  the  application  hereto  of the  laws of any
jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  In furtherance of the
foregoing,  the internal law of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  shall control
the  interpretation  and  construction of this Agreement,  even though under any
other  jurisdiction's  choice of law or conflict of law analysis the substantive
law of some other jurisdiction may ordinarily apply.

Agreement  shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other
provision of this Agreement,  which shall  otherwise  remain in full

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

               LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT


                  The  undersigned  is an  executive  employee of Hershey  Foods
    Corporation or one of its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to
    as "Hershey").  I understand that I have been selected to participate in the
    Key Employee Incentive Plan (the "Plan"),  including the Long-Term Incentive
    Program  ("LTIP") under the Plan. I understand,  acknowledge  and agree that
    the purpose of this  Agreement  is to provide for  enhanced  confidentiality
    requirements,  an  agreement  not to  compete  with  Hershey  once I  become
    eligible for supplemental retirement benefits, and an arbitration program to
    be the sole and exclusive  method for resolving  disputes.  I understand and
    acknowledge  that by this Agreement,  both I and Hershey,  in order to avoid
    delay and expense,  are  mutually  waiving the right of access to a judicial
    forum for resolving  disputes covered by the arbitration  program.  I hereby
    accept the  opportunity to participate in the Plan,  including the LTIP, and
    in  consideration of my selection by Hershey to be a participant in the Plan
    and being  eligible  to  receive  benefits  under  the Plan,  I agree to the
    following:


         1.       PARTICIPATION.

                  I understand and agree that  participating  in the LTIP at any
    time is no  guarantee I will be selected to  participate  in the LTIP or any
    other aspect of the Plan in any future  years.  I understand  and agree that
    participation  in the  Plan  and the  LTIP  is  voluntary;  specifically,  I
    understand  that I am under no obligation to  participate in the LTIP or any
    other  aspect of the Plan,  and that I may  retain my job if I decline to so
    participate.  I understand  and agree that if I elect to  participate in the
    Plan and the LTIP,  then,  depending on my job  performance,  the  financial
    performance of Hershey and the  achievement of certain goals and objectives,
    I will be eligible to receive Annual Incentive  Program Awards,  Performance
    Stock Unit Awards and Stock  Options,  in  accordance  with the terms of the
    Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.


         2.       CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  I acknowledge  that due to the nature of my employment and the
    position of trust that I hold with Hershey,  I will have special  access to,
    learn,  be  provided  with,  and in some cases will  prepare  and create for
    Hershey,  trade secrets and other  confidential and proprietary  information
    relating to Hershey's business,  including,  but not limited to, information
    about Hershey's  manufacturing  processes;  manuals,  recipes and ingredient
    percentages;   engineering  drawings;   product  and  process  research  and
    development;  new product  information;  cost  information;  supplier  data;
    strategic   business   information;


                                       1
<PAGE>
    marketing,   financial  and  business   development   information,   plans,
    forecasts,  reports and budgets;  customer information;  new product
    strategies, plans and project activities; and acquisition and divestiture
    strategies,  plans and project activities. I acknowledge and agree that such
    information,  whether or not in written  form,is the exclusive  property of
    Hershey,  that it has been and will continue to be of critical  importance
    to the business of Hershey,  and that the  disclosure  of it to,  or use by,
    competitors  or others  will cause Hershey substantial and irreparable harm.
    Accordingly, I will not, either during my  employment  or at any time  after
    the  termination  (whether voluntary  or involuntary) of my employment with
    Hershey, use, reproduce or disclose any trade secrets or other  confidential
    information  relating to the business of Hershey which is not  generally
    available  to the  public,  except as may be  specially authorized  and
    necessary in  discharging  my assigned  duties as an employee of Hershey. I
    understand and agree that my obligations  under this Agreement shall be in
    addition to,  rather than in lieu of, any  obligations  I may already have
    under any Confidentiality  Agreement or other agreement with Hershey
    relating to confidential information or under any applicable statute or at
    common law.



         3.       UNFAIR COMPETITION.

                  I understand  and  acknowledge  that Hershey is engaged in the
    business of  developing,  producing,  marketing,  selling  and  distributing
    confectionery  products,   chocolate-related   grocery  products  and  pasta
    products.  I acknowledge that the scope of Hershey's business and operations
    is world-wide.  I acknowledge  that due to the nature of my employment  with
    Hershey,  I have special  access to, contact with,  and  information  about,
    Hershey's  business  activities  as  described  above and to its  customers,
    suppliers,  agents,  licensees and licensors. I acknowledge that Hershey has
    incurred  considerable expense and invested  considerable time and resources
    in developing relationships with customers, suppliers, agents, licensees and
    licensors,  and that those  relationships  are  critical  to the  success of
    Hershey's business.

                  Accordingly,  both (a) during the term of my  employment  with
    Hershey,  and (b) for a period of three (3) years  following the termination
    of my employment for any reason,  provided at the time of such termination I
    am eligible  to receive  benefits  under  Hershey's  Supplemental  Executive
    Retirement  Plan, I shall not, without the prior written consent of Hershey,
    directly  or  indirectly  serve or act as an  officer,  director,  employee,
    consultant,  adviser,  agent or representative for the domestic or worldwide
    confectionery,  chocolate-related  grocery or pasta businesses of any entity
    or  individual  that  is  in  competition   with  Hershey's   confectionery,
    chocolate-related grocery or pasta businesses.


                                       2
<PAGE>




         4.       SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS.

                  Both I and Hershey  understand  and agree that our  respective
rights and  obligations  under,  and the terms and conditions of, this Agreement
(and the Mutual  Agreement to Arbitrate  Claims appended hereto) shall apply and
continue during,  and survive the termination (for any reason) of, my employment
with Hershey.


         5.       ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION.

                  Both I and Hershey  promise to arbitrate  any claim covered by
the  Mutual   Agreement  to  Arbitrate  Claims  which  is  attached  hereto  and
incorporated in full herein by reference.

                  Both I and Hershey further agree,  before seeking  arbitration
of any claim,  to engage in good faith  efforts to resolve the  dispute  through
nonbinding  mediation.  Mediation  shall be conducted by, and in accordance with
procedures  for the  mediation  of  employment  disputes of, one of the American
Arbitration  Association,  the Judicial  Arbitration + Mediation Services,  Inc.
(JAMS/Endispute)  or the Center for Public  Resources (CPR) as Hershey and I may
agree (and if such agreement is not possible,  then the mediation  procedures of
CPR shall apply), together with any other procedures as may be agreed upon by me
and Hershey.


         6.       SAVINGS CLAUSE AND SEVERABILITY.

                  a.  All  provisions  of  this  Agreement  (and  of the  Mutual
         Agreement to Arbitrate  Claims appended  hereto) are severable,  and if
         any of  them is  determined  to be  invalid  or  unenforceable  for any
         reason,  the  remaining  provisions  and portions  shall be  unaffected
         thereby and shall remain in full force to the fullest extent  permitted
         by law.

                  b. Without limiting the foregoing,  I specifically  agree that
         each of the  covenants  set forth in  Paragraph 3 of this  Agreement is
         severable;  that if any of them is held  invalid  or  unenforceable  by
         reason of length of time,  area  covered or  activity  covered,  or any
         combination  thereof,  or for any other reason, the court or arbitrator
         shall  adjust,  reduce or  otherwise  reform any such  covenant  to the
         extent necessary to cure any invalidity and to protect the interests of
         Hershey to the fullest  extent of the law;  that the area,  time period
         and scope of activity restricted shall be the maximum area, time period
         and  scope  of  activity  the  court  or  arbitrator  deems  valid  and
         enforceable;  and  that,  as  reformed,  such  covenant  shall  then be
         enforced.

                  c. Without limiting the foregoing,  I also specifically  agree
         that  if any  part of the  Mutual  Agreement  to  Arbitrate  Claims  is
         determined  to be invalid or

                                       3
<PAGE>


         unenforceable  for any  reason,  then the invalid or unenforceable
         portion shall be severed and the agreement to submit  any  claim to
         binding  arbitration  shall be  interpreted  and enforced as if the
         invalid or unenforceable portion did not appear.



         7.       MISCELLANEOUS.

                  a. Any notice to Hershey shall be in writing and shall be sent
         by certified  mail to Hershey Foods  Corporation,  100 Crystal A Drive,

         mail  at the  latest  address  listed  for me in  Hershey's  employment
         records,  unless I  specifically  notify Hershey in writing that notice

               LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT

                      Mutual Agreement To Arbitrate Claims


                  I recognize that  differences  may arise between Hershey Foods
Corporation  (the  "Company") and me during or following my employment  with the
Company,  and that those differences may or may not be related to my employment.
I understand and agree that by entering into this Mutual  Agreement to Arbitrate
Claims ("Arbitration Agreement"), I anticipate gaining the benefits of a speedy,
impartial dispute-resolution procedure.

                  I understand that any reference in this Arbitration  Agreement
to the  Company  will be a  reference  also  to all  subsidiary  and  affiliated
entities,   all  benefit  plans,  the  benefit  plans'  sponsors,   fiduciaries,
administrators,  affiliates and agents, and all successors and assigns of any of
them.


         A.       CLAIMS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

                  The  Company  and I  mutually  consent  to the  resolution  by
arbitration of all claims or controversies ("claims"), past, present, or future,
whether or not  arising  out of my  employment  (or its  termination),  that the
Company  may have  against me or that I may have  against the Company or against
its officers, directors, employees or agents in their capacity as such. The only
claims that are  arbitrable  are those that, in the absence of this  Arbitration
Agreement,  would have been  justiciable  under applicable state or federal law.
The claims covered by this Arbitration  Agreement  include,  but are not limited
to, claims arising out of, connected with or relating to the Long-Term Incentive
Program Participation Agreement and this Arbitration Agreement; claims for wages
or other  compensation  due;  claims  for  breach of any  contract  or  covenant
(express or implied); tort claims; claims for discrimination (including, but not
limited to, race, sex,  sexual  orientation,  religion,  national  origin,  age,
marital  status,  or medical  condition,  handicap  or  disability);  claims for
benefits  (except  claims under an employee  benefit or pension plan that either
specifies that its claims procedure shall culminate in an arbitration  procedure
different from this one or is underwritten by a commercial insurer which decides
claims);  and claims for violation of any federal,  state, or other governmental
law, statute,  regulation,  or ordinance,  except as otherwise  provided in this
Arbitration Agreement.


         B.       CLAIMS NOT COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

                  Claims I may have for workers'  compensation  or  unemployment
compensation benefits are not covered by this Agreement.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                  Also not  covered  are claims by the  Company  for  injunctive
and/or other  equitable  relief,  including  but not limited to those for unfair
competition  and/or the use and/or  unauthorized  disclosure of trade secrets or
confidential  information,  as to which I understand  and agree that the Company
may seek and obtain  relief from a court of competent  jurisdiction.  In
such an injunctive/equitable  proceeding,  I understand and agree that the court
is  entitled  to and  will  award  to the  prevailing  party  costs  and  actual
attorneys' fees incurred.


         C.       REQUIRED NOTICE OF ALL CLAIMS.

                  The  Company  and I agree that the  aggrieved  party must give
written  notice of any claim to the other party.  Written notice to the Company,
or its officers,  directors,  employees or agents, shall be sent pursuant to the
notice  provision  of the  Agreement  to which  this  Arbitration  Agreement  is
appended.

                  The written  notice shall  identify and describe the nature of
all claims asserted and the facts upon which such claims are based.


         D.       REPRESENTATION.

                  Any  party  may  be   represented  by  an  attorney  or  other
representative selected by the party.


         E.       DISCOVERY.

                  Each party shall have the right to take the  deposition of one
individual and any expert witness  designated by another party.  Each party also
shall have the right to make requests for  production of documents to any party.
The subpoena right specified below shall be applicable to discovery  pursuant to
this  paragraph.  Additional  discovery  may be had only  where  the  arbitrator
selected  pursuant to this  Arbitration  Agreement so orders,  upon a showing of
substantial need.


         F.       DESIGNATION OF WITNESSES.

                  At least 30 days  before the  arbitration,  the  parties  must
exchange  lists of witnesses,  including any expert,  and copies of all exhibits
intended to be used at the arbitration.

                                       6
<PAGE>


         G.       SUBPOENAS.

                  Each party  shall  have the right to  subpoena  witnesses  and
documents for the arbitration.


         H.       ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.

                  The arbitration  will be held under the auspices of one of the
American  Arbitration  Association,  Judicial  Arbitration + Mediation Services,
Inc. or Center for Public  Resources,  with the  designation of such  sponsoring
organization to be made by the party that did not initiate the claim.

                  The  arbitration  shall  be  confidential  and  closed  to the
public.  Any  evidence  proffered  in the  arbitration  shall be held in  strict
confidence and not disclosed to any third party.

                  The  Company  and I agree  that,  except as  provided  in this
Agreement,  the arbitration shall be in accordance with the then-current dispute
arbitration  procedures  of the  sponsoring  organization  for the type of claim
involved. The arbitration shall take place in or near the location in which I am
or was last employed by the Company.

                  The  Arbitrator  shall be selected as follows.  The sponsoring
organization  shall  give each  party a list of 7  arbitrators.  Each  party may
strike  all names on the list it deems  unacceptable.  If only one  common  name
remains on the lists of all parties,  that individual shall be designated as the
Arbitrator.  If more than one common name  remains on the lists of all  parties,
the parties shall strike names  alternately  from the list of common names until
only one remains.  The party who did not initiate the claim shall strike  first.
If  no  common  name  exists  on  the  lists  of  all  parties,  the  sponsoring
organization shall furnish an additional list and the process shall be repeated.
If no arbitrator has been selected after two lists have been  distributed,  then
the  parties  shall  strike  alternately  from a  third  list,  with  the  party
initiating the claim striking  first,  until only one name remains.  That person
shall be designated as the Arbitrator.

                  The Arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of
remedies,  if applicable) of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or federal law, or
both,  as  applicable  to the  claim(s)  asserted.  The  Arbitrator  is  without
jurisdiction  to apply any different  substantive  law, or law of remedies.  The
Federal  Rules of Evidence  shall apply.  The  Arbitrator,  and not any federal,
state, or local court or agency,  shall have exclusive  authority to resolve any
dispute  relating  to  the  interpretation,   applicability,  enforceability  or
formation of this Arbitration Agreement,  including but not limited to any claim
that all or any part of this  Arbitration  Agreement  is void or  voidable.  The
arbitration  shall be final and binding upon the parties,  except as provided in
this Arbitration Agreement.

                                       7
<PAGE>

                  The  Arbitrator  shall have  jurisdiction  to hear and rule on
pre-hearing  disputes  and is  authorized  to hold  pre-hearing  conferences  by
telephone or in person, as the Arbitrator deems necessary.  The Arbitrator shall
have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss  and/or a motion for summary
judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

                  Either party, at its expense, may arrange for and pay the cost
of a court reporter to provide a stenographic record of proceedings.

                  Either party,  upon request at the close of hearing,  shall be
given leave to file a post-hearing brief. The time for filing such a brief shall
be set by the Arbitrator.

                  The  Arbitrator  shall render a proposed  award and opinion in
the form typically rendered in labor arbitrations.

                 Either party shall have the right,  within 20 days of issuance
of the  Arbitrator's  proposed award and opinion,  to file with the Arbitrator a
motion to reconsider  (accompanied by a supporting  brief),  and the other party
shall  have 20 days  from the date of the  motion  to  respond.  The  Arbitrator
thereupon shall reconsider the issues raised by the motion and, promptly, either
confirm or change the decision,  which  (except as provided by this  Arbitration
Agreement)  shall then be final and  conclusive  upon the parties.  The costs of
such a motion for reconsideration and written opinion of the Arbitrator shall be
borne by the party  prevailing  on the  motion,  unless  the  Arbitrator  orders
otherwise.


         I.       ARBITRATION FEES AND COSTS.

                  The  Company and I shall  equally  share the fees and costs of
the Arbitrator;  provided, however, that my maximum contribution will be no more
than 20% of the amount at issue.  Each party  will  deposit  funds or post other
appropriate  security  for its share of the  Arbitrator's  fee, in an amount and
manner  determined by the  Arbitrator,  10 days before the first day of hearing.
Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys' fees, if any. However,  if
any party  prevails on a  statutory  claim which  affords the  prevailing  party
attorneys'  fees, or if there is a written  agreement  providing  for fees,  the
Arbitrator  may award fees to the  prevailing  party as  provided  by statute or
agreement.


         J.       EXCLUSIVITY, WAIVER AND BINDING EFFECT.

                  The  procedure  set out in this  Arbitration  Agreement is the
exclusive  procedure for resolving claims covered  hereunder.  The resolution of
any claim covered by this  Arbitration  Agreement  pursuant to the procedure set
out herein  shall be final and  binding on the  parties  to the  fullest  extent
permitted by law.  Both I and the Company  expressly  waive

                                      8
<PAGE>

any right to resolve any claim covered by this Arbitration Agreement through any
other  means,  including  by filing a lawsuit in court for trial by the court or
before a jury.  Both I and the Company are precluded from bringing or raising in
court or before  another forum any claim which could have been brought or raised
hereunder,  unless the right to pursue a statutory  claim or remedy is expressly
preserved by law.  Neither I nor the Company shall seek to enjoin any proceeding
hereunder  on  the  basis  that  any  award  resulting  therefrom  would  not be
enforceable.


         K.       INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

                  I  understand  and  agree  that  the  Company  is  engaged  in
transactions involving interstate commerce.


         L.       CONSIDERATION.

                  The   promises  by  the   Company  and  by  me  to   arbitrate
differences,  rather than litigate  them before courts or other bodies,  provide
consideration  for each other. In addition,  my  participation in this Long-Term
Incentive Program provides further consideration for this Arbitration Agreement.

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net sales increased $250.1
million, or 6%, from 1999 to 2000. The higher sales primarily reflected an
increase in sales of core confectionery and grocery products in North America,
incremental sales from the introduction of new confectionery products, increased
international exports and lower product returns, discounts, and allowances. In
2000, certain international distributor allowances were netted against sales
instead of being reported in selling, marketing and administrative expenses as
in 1999 and 1998. These distributor allowances amounted to $18.3 million and
$17.8 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net sales in 1999 included $29.3
million related to the Corporation&#146;s pasta business, which was sold in
January 1999. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net sales decreased $464.7
million, or 10%, from 1998 to 1999. The decrease in sales in 1999 was primarily
a result of the divestiture of the Corporation&#146;s pasta business, which
resulted in a sales reduction of $343.8 million, and sales decreases in the
United States of core confectionery and grocery products. Sales of confectionery
and grocery products declined in the first quarter of 1999 primarily as a result
of the December 1998 buy-in on promotions of regular count and vending items.
Decreases in sales in the third and fourth quarters of 1999 were primarily the
result of problems encountered after the July 1999 start-up of new business
systems and processes. These sales declines were partially offset by incremental
sales from the introduction of new confectionery products, increased export
sales in international markets and sales increases in the Corporation&#146;s
Canadian and Mexican markets. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Gross margin increased from
40.7% in 1999 to 41.5% in 2000. The increase in gross margin reflected decreased
costs for certain major raw materials, primarily cocoa, as well as lower product
returns, discounts, and allowances. The impact of these items was offset
partially by higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs in 2000, primarily
related to decreased finished goods inventory levels in 2000 compared to 1999.
In addition, the sales mix of confectionery items sold in 2000 compared to 1999
contributed to lower profitability, as the growth in sales of the more
profitable standard bars was outpaced by sales of packaged confectionery items.
Also, higher distribution and warehousing costs in 2000 reflected higher
warehouse handling costs, incremental costs associated with expanded warehousing
capacity and one-time start-up costs for new distribution centers located near
Hershey, Pennsylvania and Atlanta, Georgia. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Gross margin in 1999
benefited .3 percentage points from the inclusion in cost of sales of a one-time
$12.5 million gain from revisions to the Corporation&#146;s retiree medical
plan, net of contributions into the Employee Savings Stock Investment and
Ownership Plan (&#147;ESSIOP&#148;). During the first quarter of 1999, the
Corporation changed its retiree medical plan to eliminate coverage for all
eligible hourly employees under age 45, to be replaced by annual contributions
into the ESSIOP. The change applied primarily to U.S. hourly employees working
in Pennsylvania. In addition, gross margin in 1999 would have been .3 percentage
points lower if certain international distributor allowances were reclassified
and reported as discussed above for 2000. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Gross margin decreased from
40.8% in 1998 to 40.7% in 1999. The decrease reflected lower profitability
resulting from the mix of confectionery items sold in 1999 compared with sales
during 1998, primarily related to lower sales of the more profitable standard
bars. Higher freight and distribution costs, reflecting increased costs related
to the implementation of new business systems and processes and distribution
center capacity constraints, and higher depreciation expense as a percent of
sales, also contributed to the lower gross margin. These cost increases were
offset partially by selling price</FONT></P>

materials. Effective December 1998, the Corporation changed its retiree medical
plan to eliminate coverage for all U.S. full-time salaried employees and all
non-union hourly plant employees working outside Hershey, Pennsylvania under age
45, replacing it with annual ESSIOP contributions, resulting in the recognition
of a $13.0 million pre-tax gain in 1998. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Selling, marketing and
administrative expenses increased $69.3 million, or 7%, from 1999 to 2000,
primarily reflecting: increased marketing expenditures for core confectionery
brands, international exports and the introduction of new products; increased
selling and administrative expenses primarily related to higher staffing levels
to support sales and customer service activity in North America and the
international export business; higher incentive compensation expense reflecting
improved operating performance in 2000; and higher software amortization costs.
The impact of these items was offset partially by the inclusion in
administrative expense in 2000 of a one-time gain of $7.3 million arising from
the sale of certain corporate aircraft. Selling, marketing and administrative
costs in 1999 included $10.7 million related to the Corporation&#146;s pasta
business, which was sold in January 1999. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Selling, marketing and
administrative expenses decreased by $110.1 million, or 9%, from 1998 to 1999,
reflecting lower expenses resulting from the divestiture of the pasta business,
reduced marketing expenses for core confectionery brands and lower
administrative expenses. These decreases were offset partially by increased
spending associated with the introduction of new products and international
exports, in addition to higher amortization expense for capitalized software.
Excluding the divestiture of the pasta business, advertising and promotion
expense was essentially equal to the prior year as a percent of sales. </FONT></P>

2000 was $1.7 million above the prior year, primarily as a result of higher
short-term interest expense related to increased average short-term borrowings
and borrowing rates, and lower capitalized interest. The impact of these items
was offset partially by higher interest income, and lower fixed interest expense
as a result of interest rate swap and forward agreements entered into in October
1999. Net interest expense in 1999 was $11.4 million below the prior year,
primarily as a result of lower short-term interest expense as a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of the pasta business and positive cash flow were used to
reduce short-term borrowings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
financial condition remained strong during 2000. The capitalization ratio (total
short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders&#146; equity,
short-term and long-term debt) was 49% as of December&nbsp;31, 2000 and 50% as
of December 31, 1999. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was
1.7:1 as of December&nbsp;31, 2000, and 1.8:1 as of December 31, 1999. The lower
ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of December 31, 2000,
primarily reflected increased short-term borrowings to finance stock repurchases
and a business acquisition. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In December 2000, the
Corporation completed the purchase of the intense and breath freshener mints and

$135.0 million to acquire the businesses, including <I>Ice Breakers </I>and

<I>Ice Breakers, Carefree, Stick*Free, Bubble Yum </I>and <I>Fruit Stripe</I>

sales of approximately $270 million in 1999. The Corporation&#146;s results of
operations for 2000 did not include results of the acquisition, as the

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Total assets increased
$101.1 million, or 3%, as of December 31, 2000, primarily as a result of higher
accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, property, plant
and equipment, and intangibles resulting from business acquisitions,
substantially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. These increases
were due, in part, to the acquisition of Nabisco&#146;s mint and gum businesses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Current assets increased by
$15.4 million, or 1%, reflecting increased accounts receivable, inventories,
prepaid expenses and other current assets. An increase in accounts receivable of
$26.9 million reflected higher sales in December 2000. The increase in prepaid
expenses and other current assets was principally associated with hedging
transactions. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflected the comparison
to an unusually high balance as of December 31, 1999, as a result of year 2000
(Y2K) liquidity contingency plans. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Property, plant and
equipment was higher than the prior year primarily due to capital additions of
$138.3 million and the acquisition of the Nabisco businesses, partially offset
by depreciation expense of $140.2 million. The increase in intangibles resulting
from business acquisitions primarily reflected preliminary goodwill associated
with the Nabisco acquisition, partly offset by the amortization of intangibles.
The decrease in other non-current assets was primarily associated with the
amortization of capitalized software. </FONT></P>

by $24.7 million, or 1%, as of December 31, 2000, primarily reflecting higher
accrued liabilities and an increase in short-term borrowings to finance the
acquisition of the Nabisco businesses and stock repurchases, partially offset by
a decrease in accrued and deferred income taxes. The increase in accrued
liabilities was associated primarily with higher accruals for promotion and
advertising programs and accrued liabilities related to the Nabisco acquisition.
The decrease in accrued income taxes primarily reflected a decrease in the
income tax provision which included accrued income taxes for the gain on sale of
the pasta business as of December 31, 1999, and the decrease in deferred income
taxes was associated with the payment in September 2000 of an assessment related

was supported by the Corporation&#146;s largest stockholder, Hershey Trust
Company, as trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (&#147;Milton
Hershey School Trust&#148;). This action was not in response to any specific
effort to acquire control of the Corporation. Under the Rights Agreement, the

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Historically, the
Corporation&#146;s major source of financing has been cash generated from
operations. The Corporation&#146;s income and, consequently, cash provided from
operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales patterns, the timing
of new product introductions, business acquisitions and divestitures, and price
increases. Chocolate, confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related
sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the
year, representing the principal seasonal effect. Generally, seasonal working
capital needs peak during the summer months and have been met by issuing
commercial paper. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->

cash provided from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of the pasta
business exceeded cash requirements for share repurchases, capital expenditures,
capitalized software additions, dividend payments and a business acquisition by
$88.7 million. Total debt, including debt assumed, decreased during the period
by $150.9 million, reflecting reduced short-term borrowings and the repayment of
long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $22.3 million during the
period. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation anticipates
that capital expenditures and capitalized software additions will be in the
range of $150 million to $170&nbsp;million per annum during the next several
years as a result of continued modernization of existing facilities and capacity
expansion to support new products and line extensions, along with continued
improvement and enhancements of computer software. As of December&nbsp;31, 2000,
the Corporation&#146;s principal capital commitments included manufacturing
capacity expansion to support new products and line extensions, modernization
and efficiency improvements. </FONT></P>

short-term borrowings associated with the purchase of Common Stock from the
Milton Hershey School Trust. As of December 31, 2000, $250 million of debt
securities remained available for issuance under the August 1997 Registration

banks. In December 2000, the short-term credit facility agreement was renewed
for a total of $200 million and the long-term committed credit facility
agreement remained in effect for $300 million, expiring in December 2002. The
credit facilities may be used to fund general corporate requirements, to support
commercial paper borrowings and, in certain instances, to finance future

the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) related to years 1989 through

(&#147;COLI&#148;) program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The
IRS disallowed the interest expense deductions associated with the underlying
life insurance policies. The total deficiency of $61.2 million, including

interest. The Corporation may be subject to additional assessments for federal
taxes and interest for 1997 and 1998 and for state taxes and interest for 1989

financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, the Corporation, from time

1999, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert $200 million of 6.7% Notes Due 2005 (&#147;Notes&#148;) to
variable rate debt. In December 2000, the counterparty chose to cancel the
interest rate swap and forward agreements effective April&nbsp;2, 2001.
Subsequent to this date, the effective interest rate on the Notes will return to
a fixed rate of 6.7%. The potential loss in fair value of interest rate swaps
and forward agreements resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in
market rates of ten percent was not material as of December 31, 2000 and 1999. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The cost of cocoa beans and
the prices for the related commodity futures contracts historically have been
subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors, including the
effect of weather on crop yield, other imbalances between supply and demand,
currency exchange rates, political unrest in producing countries and speculative
influences. Cocoa prices remained near historical lows during most of 2000, as
additional production, spurred by high prices in the mid-1990s, has come on
stream under favorable climatic conditions. Additionally, demand has been
reduced below historical levels as a result of economic difficulties in Eastern
Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union. During 2001, continued improvement
in chocolate consuming economies could result in prices stabilizing and possibly
moving higher. The Corporation&#146;s costs during 2001 will not necessarily
reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices,
premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times,
and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. </FONT></P>

the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such cash transfers will be offset by higher or

analysis reflects the market risk of the Corporation to a hypothetical adverse

contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts for the same
commodities, relating to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners and natural gas.
Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not
yet contracted for were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. A
loss is defined, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential

recent five-year period, the return has ranged from 17.8% in 1996 to 14.8% in
1999. Average invested capital consists of the annual average of beginning and
ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income taxes and stockholders&#146;
equity. For the purpose of calculating operating return on average invested
capital, earnings is defined as net income, excluding the after-tax loss on

current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
strategy is to profitably grow its North American confectionery and grocery
business, and to build growing and profitable confectionery businesses in
selected markets outside North America. To implement this strategy, the
Corporation plans to continue to attract and hold customers and consumers with
products and services of consistently superior quality and value. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The total U.S.
confectionery market is anticipated to grow at a rate of three to four percent
in 2001. Over the years, the Corporation&#146;s goal has been to grow at a
faster rate than the overall confectionery category. The Corporation expects to
achieve this goal in 2001 by the integration of recently acquired products,
strong results from new product introductions and the continued volume growth of
confectionery products in North America and selected international markets. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Variability of gross margin
in future periods is affected by various factors, including raw material and
logistics costs, manufacturing efficiencies, and the mix of products sold in any
period. The Corporation expects to improve profitability in 2001. Gross margin
is expected to increase in 2001, as compared to the full year 2000, as the
Corporation anticipates a more profitable sales mix, manufacturing efficiencies,
modest declines in freight and distribution costs as a percent of sales and
relatively stable commodity costs. These profitability improvements are expected
to more than offset anticipated increases in employee benefits and energy costs. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The industry in which the
Corporation operates is characterized by brand recognition. The Corporation will
continue spending to promote its products and to increase the value of its
brands. Planned spending on advertising in 2001 is significantly higher than
2000, while selling and administrative expenses are expected to remain
relatively constant as a percent of sales. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The tax rate is projected
to slightly decrease in 2001, as incremental earnings from the
Corporation&#146;s recent acquisition will be taxed at a more favorable tax
rate. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation expects
continued strong cash flows from operating activities in 2001. Net cash provided
from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital
additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments.
Additionally, cash provided from operations is expected to be sufficient to
reduce short-term borrowings and/or finance possible business acquisitions and
continued repurchases of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In May 2000, the Emerging
Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-14 <I>&#147;Accounting for Coupons,
Rebates and Discounts,&#148;</I> requiring the reporting of certain sales
incentives such as consumer coupon redemption costs and off-invoice allowances
as a reduction of net sales. Effective with the quarter ending June 30, 2001,
consumer coupon redemption costs and off-invoice allowances currently reported
as marketing expense will be reported as a reduction of net sales. The
implementation of EITF Issue No. 00-14, along with other similar pending EITF
issues regarding the classification of certain sales incentives, may result in a
material restatement to reduce net sales, with a corresponding restatement to
reduce selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Upon adoption, all prior
period amounts will be reclassified to conform to the new requirements. </FONT></P>

Corporation notes the following factors which, among others, could cause future
results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations

confectionery and grocery business environment, including actions of competitors
and changes in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws and
regulations, including income taxes; market demand for new and existing

allows a derivative&#146;s gains and losses to offset related results on the

transactions that receive hedge accounting. </FONT></P>

is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, but may be
implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance.
Retroactive application is not permitted. SFAS No. 133 must be applied to (a)
derivative instruments and (b) certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid
contracts that were issued, acquired, or substantively modified after December
31, 1997. Changes in accounting methods will be required for derivative
instruments utilized by the Corporation to hedge commodity price, foreign

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Generally, the
Corporation&#146;s short-term borrowings are in the form of commercial paper or
bank loans with an original maturity of three months or less. As of December 31,
2000, the Corporation maintained a committed credit facility agreement with a
syndicate of banks in the amount of $500 million which could be borrowed
directly or used to support the issuance of commercial paper. The Corporation
may increase the credit facility by $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the
banks. In December 2000, the short-term credit facility agreement was renewed
for a total of $200 million and the long-term committed credit facility
agreement remained in effect for $300 million, expiring in December 2002. The
credit facilities may be used to fund general corporate requirements, to support
commercial paper borrowings and, in certain instances, to finance future
business acquisitions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation also
maintains lines of credit arrangements with domestic and international
commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various currencies up to
approximately $27.5 million and $25.0 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2000 and
1999, respectively, at the lending banks&#146; prime commercial interest rates
or lower. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation had
combined domestic commercial paper borrowings and short-term foreign bank loans
against its credit facilities and lines of credit of $257.6 million as of
December 31, 2000, and $209.2 million as of December 31, 1999. The
weighted-average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding as of
December&nbsp;31, 2000 and 1999, were 6.4% and 5.8%, respectively. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The credit facilities and
lines of credit were supported by commitment fee arrangements. The average fee
during 2000 was less than .1% per annum of the commitment. The
Corporation&#146;s credit facility agreements contain a financial covenant which
requires that a specified interest and fixed charge ratio be maintained. These
agreements are also subject to other representations and covenants which do not
materially restrict the Corporation&#146;s activities. The Corporation is in
compliance with all covenants included in the credit facility agreements. There
were no significant compensating balance agreements which legally restricted
these funds. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As a result of maintaining
a consolidated cash management system, the Corporation maintains overdraft
positions at certain banks. Such overdrafts, which were included in accounts
payable, were $22.5 million and $20.4 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2000 and
1999, respectively. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In January 1999, the
Corporation received a Notice of Proposed Deficiency (&#147;Notice&#148;) from
the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) related to the years 1989 through
1996. The Notice pertained to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance
(&#147;COLI&#148;) program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The
IRS disallowed the interest expense deductions associated with the underlying
life insurance policies. The total deficiency of $61.2 million, including
interest, was paid to the IRS in September 2000 to eliminate further accruing of
interest. The Corporation may be subject to additional assessments for federal
taxes and interest for 1997 and 1998 and for state taxes and interest for 1989
through 1998. The Corporation believes that it has fully complied with the tax
law as it relates to its COLI program, has filed for the refund of amounts paid
and will continue to seek favorable resolution of this matter. </FONT></P>

post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with
participants&#146; contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan
is non-contributory. During the first quarter of 1999, for all eligible
employees under age 45, the Corporation provided annual contributions into the
Employee Savings Stock Investment and Ownership Plan (&#147;ESSIOP&#148;)
instead of providing coverage under the current retiree medical plan. This
change resulted in the immediate recognition of a $15.4 million pre-tax gain
which is not included above as a component of net periodic benefits costs. The

employee stock ownership trust (&#147;ESOP&#148;) serves as the primary vehicle
for contributions to its existing ESSIOP for participating domestic salaried and
hourly employees. The ESOP was funded by a 15-year 7.75% loan of $47.9 million
from the Corporation. During 2000 and 1999, the ESOP received a combination of
dividends on unallocated shares and contributions from the Corporation equal to
the amount required to meet its principal and interest payments under the loan.
Simultaneously, the ESOP allocated to participants 159,176 shares of Common
Stock each year. As of December 31, 2000, the ESOP held 1,058,028 allocated
shares and 955,048 unallocated shares. All ESOP shares are considered
outstanding for income per share computations. </FONT></P>

of common stock had been issued of which 136,281,588 shares were outstanding. No

Protection Rights Agreement and declared a dividend of one right
(&#147;Right&#148;) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock
payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000.
The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance
of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per
share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which the
Corporation&#146;s Common Stock is traded. </FONT></P>

announcement that a person or group has acquired 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a person or group becoming the beneficial owner
of more than 35% of the voting power of all of the outstanding Common Stock and
Class B Stock. When exercisable, each Right entitles its registered holder to
purchase from the Corporation, at a pre-determined exercise price, one
one-thousandth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, par value
$1.00 per share (which would be convertible by holders of Class B Stock into
Series B Participating Preferred Stock on the basis of one one-thousandth of a
share of Series B Participating Preferred Stock for every share of Class B
Common Stock held at that time). Each one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Participating Preferred Stock would have economic and voting terms similar to
those of one share of Common Stock. Similarly, each one one-thousandth of a
share of Series B Participating Preferred Stock would have economic and voting
terms similar to those of one share of Class B Stock. </FONT></P>

Stock, each Right (except those owned by the acquiring person or group) will
automatically become a right to buy, at the pre-determined exercise price, that
number of one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred
Stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. In addition, if the
Corporation is acquired in a merger or other business combination, each Right
will entitle a holder to purchase from the acquiring company, for the
pre-determined exercise price, preferred stock of the acquiring company having
an aggregate market value equal to twice the exercise price. </FONT></P>

option equals the market price of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock on the
date of grant. Each option has a maximum term of ten years. Options granted
under the Incentive Plan prior to December 31, 1999, vest at the end of the
second year after grant. In 2000, the terms and conditions of the grant were
changed to provide for pro-rated vesting over four years for options granted
subsequent to December 31, 1999. Options granted under the HSY Growth program
vest at the end of the fifth year and have a term of ten years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Under the long-term portion
of the Incentive Plan, each January the Corporation grants selected executives
and other key employees performance stock units whose vesting is contingent upon
the achievement of certain performance objectives. If at the end of the
applicable three-year performance cycle, targets for financial measures of
earnings per share, economic value added and free cash flow are met, the full
number of shares are awarded to the participants. The performance scores can

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Hershey Foods Corporation
is responsible for the financial statements and other financial information
contained in this report. The Corporation believes that the financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States appropriate under the circumstances to reflect in all
material respects the substance of applicable events and transactions. In
preparing the financial statements, it is necessary that management make
informed estimates and judgments. The other financial information in this annual
report is consistent with the financial statements. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation maintains a
system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
that financial records are reliable for purposes of preparing financial
statements and that assets are properly accounted for and safeguarded. The
concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost of the
system must be related to the benefits to be derived. The Corporation believes
its system provides an appropriate balance in this regard. The Corporation
maintains an Internal Audit Department which reviews the adequacy and tests the
application of internal accounting controls. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The financial statements
have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, whose
appointment was ratified by stockholder vote at the stockholders&#146; meeting
held on April 25, 2000. Their report expresses an opinion that the
Corporation&#146;s financial statements are fairly stated in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and they have
indicated to us that their audit was performed in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States which are designed to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. </FONT></P>


<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, consisting solely of non-management directors,
meets regularly with the independent public accountants, internal auditors and
management to discuss, among other things, the audit scopes and results.
Arthur&nbsp;Andersen&nbsp;LLP and the internal auditors both have full and free
access to the Audit Committee, with and without the presence of management. </FONT></P>

Directors<BR>of Hershey Foods Corporation: </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hershey Foods Corporation (a
Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders&#146;
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2000,
appearing on pages A-12 through A-31. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We conducted our audits in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Hershey Foods Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2000 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. </FONT></P>

assets, the Acquiring Person controls the Board of Directors of the Company. For
purposes of the foregoing description, the term "Acquiring Person" shall include
any Acquiring  Person and its Affiliates and Associates,  counted  together as a

event,  shall have caused the closing  prices used to determine the Market Price
on any  Trading  Days  during  such  period of 20  Trading  Days not to be fully
comparable  with the closing price on such date, each such closing price so used
shall be  appropriately  adjusted in order to make it fully  comparable with the

2.1 SUMMARY OF RIGHTS. As soon as practicable after the Record Time, the Company
will mail a letter,  that incorporates by reference the terms of this Agreement,
to each  holder  of  record of Common  Shares  as of the  Record  Time,  at such
holder's address as shown by the records of the Company.

2.2 LEGEND ON COMMON  SHARES  CERTIFICATES.  Certificates  for the Common Shares
issued after the Payment Time but prior to the  Separation  Time shall  evidence
one Right for each Common Share represented thereby and shall have impressed on,
printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:

         Until the Separation Time (as defined in the Rights Agreement  referred
         to below),  this  certificate  also  evidences  and entitles the holder
         hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Rights  Agreement,  dated as
         of  December  15, 2000 (as such may be amended  from time to time,  the
         "Rights Agreement"),  between Hershey Foods Corporation (the "Company")
         and the  Rights  Agent  named  therein,  the terms of which are  hereby
         incorporated  herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the
         principal   executive   offices   of   the   Company.   Under   certain
         circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights may be
         redeemed,  may  become  exercisable  for  securities  or  assets of the
         Company or securities of another entity, may be exchanged for Preferred
         Stock or other  securities  or assets of the Company,  may expire,  may
         become void (if they are "Beneficially  Owned" by an "Acquiring Person"
         or an Affiliate or Associate thereof,  as such terms are defined in the
         Rights Agreement,  or by any transferee of any of the foregoing) or may
         be evidenced by separate certificates and may no longer be evidenced by
         this certificate. The Company will mail or arrange for the mailing of a
         copy of the Rights Agreement to the holder of this certificate  without
         charge after the receipt of a written request therefor.

Certificates  representing  Common Shares that are issued and outstanding at the
Payment Time shall,  together  with the letter  mailed  pursuant to Section 2.1,
evidence one Right for each Common Share evidenced thereby  notwithstanding  the
absence of the foregoing legend.

                   If the Common  Shares issued after the Payment Time but prior
to the Separation Time shall be uncertificated,  the registration of such Common
Shares on the stock  transfer  books of the Company shall evidence one Right for
each Common Share represented thereby and the Company shall mail to every Person
that holds such Common Shares a confirmation of the  registration of such Common
Shares on the stock transfer books of the Company,  which confirmation will have
impressed, printed, written

                                        9
<PAGE>


or stamped thereon or otherwise  affixed  thereto the above legend.  The Company
shall mail or arrange for the mailing of a copy of this  Agreement to any Person
that holds Common Shares,  as evidenced by the registration of the Common Shares
in the name of such Person on the stock transfer  books of the Company,  without
charge after the receipt of a written request therefor.

2.3 EXERCISE OF RIGHTS;  SEPARATION OF RIGHTS.  (a) Subject to Sections 3.1, 5.1
and 5.10 and subject to adjustment as herein set forth,  each Right will entitle
the holder thereof,  on or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration
Time, to purchase,  for the Exercise  Price,  one  one-thousandth  of a share of
Preferred Stock.

                  (b) Until the  Separation  Time, (i) no Right may be exercised
and (ii) each Right will be  evidenced  by the  certificate  for the  associated
Common Share together,  in the case of certificates  issued prior to the Payment
Time,  with the letter mailed to the record holder  thereof  pursuant to Section
2.1 (or, if the Common Shares shall be  uncertificated,  by the  registration of
the  associated  Common Share on the stock transfer books of the Company and the
confirmation  thereof provided for in Section 2.2) and will be transferable only
together with,  and will be  transferred by a transfer  (whether with or without
such letter or confirmation) of, such associated share.

                  (c) Subject to the terms and  conditions  hereof,  on or after
the  Separation  Time and prior to the  Expiration  Time,  the Rights (i) may be
exercised and (ii) may be transferred independent of the Common Shares. Promptly
following  the  Separation  Time,  upon  receipt by the  Rights  Agent of notice
thereof and receipt of all other  necessary  information,  the Rights Agent will
mail to each holder of record of a Common Share as of the Separation Time (other
than any Person whose Rights have become void  pursuant to Section  3.1(b)),  at
such holder's address as shown by the records of the Company (the Company hereby
agreeing  to  furnish  copies  of such  records  to the  Rights  Agent  for this
purpose),  (x) a certificate  in  substantially  the form of Exhibit A hereto (a
"RIGHTS  CERTIFICATE"),  appropriately  completed,  representing  the  number of
Rights  held by such  holder at the  Separation  Time and  having  such marks of
identification  or  designation  and such  legends,  summaries  or  endorsements
printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate (but which do not effect the
rights or duties  of the  Rights  Agent)  and as are not  inconsistent  with the
provisions  of this  Agreement,  or as may be required to comply with any law or
with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation
of any national  securities exchange or quotation system on which the Rights may
from  time to time be listed  or  traded,  or to  conform  to  usage,  and (y) a
disclosure statement describing the Rights; provided,  however, that the Company
shall have no  obligation  to distribute  Rights  Certificates  to any Acquiring
Person or Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or any transferee of any
of the foregoing.

          (d)  Subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  hereof,  Rights  may be
     exercised on any Business Day on or after the Separation  Time and prior to
     the

                                       10
<PAGE>





Expiration  Time by  submitting  to the  Rights  Agent  the  Rights  Certificate
evidencing  such Rights with an Election to Exercise (an "Election to Exercise")
substantially  in the form attached to the Rights  Certificate duly and properly
completed,  accompanied  by payment in cash,  or by certified  or official  bank
check or money order payable to the order of the Company,  of a sum equal to the
Exercise  Price  multiplied  by the number of Rights being  exercised  and a sum
sufficient  to cover any tax or charge  which may be  payable  in respect of any
transfer  involved in the  transfer or  delivery of Rights  Certificates  or the
issuance or delivery of certificates (or, if uncertificated, the registration on
the stock transfer  books of the Company) for shares or depositary  receipts (or
both) in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being exercised.


          (e) Upon  receipt of a Rights  Certificate,  with a duly and  properly
completed  Election to Exercise  accompanied  by payment as set forth in Section
2.3(d),  and subject to the terms and conditions  hereof,  the Rights Agent will
thereupon  promptly (i)(A)  requisition from a transfer agent stock certificates
evidencing such number of shares or other  securities to be purchased or, in the
case of uncertificated  shares or other securities,  requisition from a transfer
agent a notice  setting  forth such number of shares or other  securities  to be
purchased for which registration will be made on the stock transfer books of the
Company (the  Company  hereby  irrevocably  authorizing  its transfer  agents to
comply with all such  requisitions)  and (B) if the Company  elects  pursuant to
Section  5.5 not to issue  certificates  (or effect  registrations  on the stock
transfer books of the Company) representing fractional shares,  requisition from
the depositary  selected by the Company  depositary  receipts  representing  the
fractional  shares to be purchased or requisition from the Company the amount of
cash to be paid in lieu of fractional  shares in accordance with Section 5.5 and
(ii) after receipt of such  certificates,  depositary  receipts,  notices and/or
cash,  deliver  the same to or upon the order of the  registered  holder of such
Rights Certificate, registered (in the case of certificates, depositary receipts
or  notices)  in such name or names as may be  designated  by such  holder.  The
Rights Agent shall have no duty or  obligation  with respect to this Section and
any other Section of this  Agreement  relating to  fractional  shares unless and
until it has received  specific  instructions (and sufficient cash, if required)
from the Company with respect to its duties and obligations under such Sections.

          (f) In case the holder of any Rights shall  exercise less than all the
Rights evidenced by such holder's Rights  Certificate,  a new Rights Certificate
evidencing the Rights  remaining  unexercised will be issued by the Rights Agent
to such holder or to such holder's duly authorized assigns.

          (g) The  Company  covenants  and agrees that it will (i) take all such
action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares  delivered (or evidenced by
registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) upon exercise of Rights
shall, at the time of delivery of the  certificates (or  registration)  for such
shares  (subject  to  payment  of the  Exercise  Price),  be  duly  and  validly
authorized,  executed,  issued and delivered (or  registered) and fully paid and
nonassessable; (ii) take all such action as may be necessary
                                       11
<PAGE>



to comply with any applicable  requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable
law,  rule or  regulation,  in  connection  with the issuance of any shares upon
exercise  of Rights;  and (iii) pay when due and payable any and all federal and
state taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the original issuance
or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any shares issued upon the exercise
of Rights,  provided,  that the Company  shall not be required to pay any tax or
charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer  involved in the transfer
or delivery of Rights  Certificates  or the issuance or delivery of certificates
(or the  registration) for shares in a name other than that of the holder of the
Rights being transferred or exercised.

          2.4 ADJUSTMENTS TO EXERCISE PRICE;  NUMBER OF RIGHTS. (a) In the event
the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the  Separation
Time (i)  declare or pay a  dividend  on any class of Common  Shares  payable in
Common Stock or Class B Common  Stock,  as the case may be, (ii)  subdivide  any
outstanding  class of Common  Shares or (iii) combine any  outstanding  class of
Common Shares into a smaller  number of shares of Common Stock or Class B Common
Stock,  as the  case  may be,  (x) the  Exercise  Price  in  effect  after  such
adjustment  will be equal to the Exercise Price in effect  immediately  prior to
such  adjustment  divided  by the  number of  shares of Common  Stock or Class B
Common  Stock  (the  "Expansion  Factor"),  that a holder of one share of Common
Stock or Class B Common  Stock,  as the case may be,  immediately  prior to such
dividend,  subdivision or combination  would hold thereafter as a result thereof
and (y) each Right held prior to such  adjustment  will  become  that  number of
Rights equal to the Expansion Factor,  and the adjusted number of Rights will be
deemed  to be  distributed  among the  shares of Common  Stock or Class B Common
Stock,  as the case may be,  with  respect  to which the  original  Rights  were
associated (if they remain outstanding) and the shares issued in respect of such
dividend, subdivision or combination, so that each such share of Common Stock or
Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, will have exactly one Right associated
with it. Each adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be made as of the
payment  or  effective  date  for  the  applicable   dividend,   subdivision  or
combination.


In the event the  Company  shall at any time after the Record  Time and prior to
the  Separation  Time issue any Common  Shares  otherwise  than in a transaction
referred to in the preceding  paragraph,  each such Common Share so issued shall
automatically  have one new  Right  associated  with it,  which  Right  shall be
evidenced by the certificate  representing  such share (or, if the Common Shares
shall be  uncertificated,  such Right shall be evidenced by the  registration of
such  Common  Shares  on the  stock  transfer  books  of  the  Company  and  the
confirmation thereof provided for in Section 2.2). Rights shall be issued by the
Company in respect of Common Shares that are issued or sold by the Company after
the Separation Time only to the extent provided in Section 5.3.

                                       12
<PAGE>


          (b) In the event the  Company  shall at any time after the Record Time
and prior to the Separation Time issue or distribute any securities or assets in
respect of, in lieu of or in exchange for Common  Shares (other than pursuant to
any non-extraordinary periodic cash dividend or a dividend paid solely in Common
Shares)  whether  by  dividend,   in  a  reclassification   or  recapitalization
(including any such transaction  involving a merger,  consolidation or statutory
share exchange), or otherwise, the Company shall make such adjustments,  if any,
in the Exercise  Price,  number of Rights and/or  securities  or other  property
purchasable upon exercise of Rights as the Board of Directors of the Company, in
its sole discretion, may deem to be appropriate under the circumstances in order
to adequately protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally,  and the
Company and the Rights Agent shall amend this  Agreement as necessary to provide
for such adjustments.

          (c) Each  adjustment  to the  Exercise  Price  made  pursuant  to this
Section 2.4 shall be calculated  to the nearest cent.  Whenever an adjustment to
the Exercise  Price is made  pursuant to this Section 2.4, the Company shall (i)
promptly  prepare a  certificate  setting  forth  such  adjustment  and a brief,
reasonably  detailed  statement  of  the  facts,  computations  and  methodology
accounting for such  adjustment and (ii) promptly file with the Rights Agent and
with each transfer agent for the Common Shares a copy of such  certificate.  The
Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such  certificate and on
any  adjustment  therein  contained  and shall have no duty with  respect to and
shall not be deemed to have  knowledge  of any  adjustment  unless  and until it
shall have received such a certificate.

          (d) Rights  Certificates  shall  represent  the right to purchase  the
securities  purchasable  under  the  terms  of  this  Agreement,  including  any
adjustment or change in the securities  purchasable upon exercise of the Rights,
even though such certificates may continue to express the securities purchasable
at the time of issuance of the initial Rights Certificates.

          2.5 DATE ON WHICH EXERCISE IS EFFECTIVE. Each Person in whose name any
certificate for shares is issued (or registration on the stock transfer books is
effected)  upon the  exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have
become the holder of record of the shares  represented  thereby on the date upon
which the Rights  Certificate  evidencing  such Rights was duly  surrendered and
payment of the  Exercise  Price for such  Rights (and any  applicable  taxes and
other governmental charges payable by the exercising holder hereunder) was made;
provided, however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon
which the stock transfer  books of the Company are closed,  such Person shall be
deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such  certificate
(or registration)  shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the
stock transfer books of the Company are open.



          2.6   EXECUTION,   AUTHENTICATION,   DELIVERY  AND  DATING  OF  RIGHTS
     CERTIFICATES.  (a) The Rights  Certificates  shall be executed on behalf of
the Company by

                                       13
<PAGE>





its Chairman of the Board,  President or one of its Vice  Presidents,  under its
corporate  seal  reproduced  thereon  attested  by its  Secretary  or one of its
Assistant  Secretaries.  The  signature  of any of these  officers on the Rights
Certificates may be manual or facsimile.

          Rights  Certificates  bearing the manual or  facsimile  signatures  of
individuals  who were at any time the proper  officers of the Company shall bind
the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to
hold such  offices  prior to the  countersignature  and  delivery of such Rights
Certificates.

          Promptly  after the  Separation  Time,  the Company  will  notify,  in
writing,  the  Rights  Agent of such  Separation  Time and will  deliver  Rights
Certificates executed by the Company to the Rights Agent for  counter-signature,
and, subject to Section 3.1(b), the Rights Agent shall manually  countersign and
deliver  such  Rights  Certificates  to the  holders of the Rights  pursuant  to
Section  2.3(c)  hereof.  No Rights  Certificate  shall be valid for any purpose
unless manually countersigned by the Rights Agent.


          (b)    Each Rights Certificate shall be dated the date of
countersignature thereof.

          2.7 REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. (a) After the
Separation  Time,  the  Company  will cause to be kept a register  (the  "RIGHTS
REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe,
the Company will provide for the registration and transfer of Rights. The Rights
Agent is hereby appointed "Rights  Registrar" for the purpose of maintaining the
Rights Register for the Company and  registering  Rights and transfers of Rights
after the Separation Time as herein provided. In the event that the Rights Agent
shall cease to be the Rights Registrar,  the Rights Agent will have the right to
examine the Rights Register at all reasonable times after the Separation Time.

          After the  Separation  Time and  prior to the  Expiration  Time,  upon
surrender for  registration  of transfer or exchange of any Rights  Certificate,
and  subject to the  provisions  of Section  2.7(c) and (d),  the  Company  will
execute,  and the Rights Agent will countersign and deliver,  in the name of the
holder or the designated transferee or transferees,  as required pursuant to the
holder's instructions,  one or more new Rights Certificates  evidencing the same
aggregate number of Rights as did the Rights Certificate so surrendered.

          (b)    Except as otherwise  provided in Section 3.1(b), all Rights issued
upon any  registration of transfer or exchange of Rights  Certificates  shall be
the valid  obligations of the Company,  and such Rights shall be entitled to the
same  benefits  under  this  Agreement  as  the  Rights  surrendered  upon  such
registration of transfer or exchange.

          (c)    Every Rights  Certificate  surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange  shall be duly  endorsed,  or be  accompanied  by a written
instrument of transfer


                                       14
<PAGE>



in form  satisfactory  to the Company or the Rights  Agent,  as the case may be,
duly executed by the holder thereof or such holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing. As a condition to the issuance of any new Rights Certificate under this
Section  2.7, the Company may require the payment of a sum  sufficient  to cover
any tax or other  charge  that may be imposed in  relation  thereto.  The Rights
Agent shall have no duty or  obligation  to take any action under any Section of
this Agreement which requires the payment by a Rights holder of applicable taxes
and charges  unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied  that all such taxes
and/or charges have been paid.

          (d)    The Company  shall not register the transfer or exchange of any
Rights which have become void under Section 3.1(b), been exchanged under Section
3.1(c) or been redeemed under Section 5.1.

          2.8 MUTILATED,  DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN RIGHTS CERTIFICATES. (a) If
any mutilated Rights Certificate is surrendered to the Rights Agent prior to the
Expiration Time, then,  subject to Sections 3.1(b),  3.1(c) and 5.1, the Company
shall  execute and the Rights  Agent shall  countersign  and deliver in exchange
therefor a new Rights  Certificate  evidencing  the same number of Rights as did
the Rights Certificate so surrendered.

          (b) If there shall be  delivered  to the Company and the Rights  Agent
prior  to  the  Expiration  Time  (i)  evidence  to  their  satisfaction  of the
destruction,  loss or theft of any Rights  Certificate and (ii) such security or
indemnity  as may be  required  by them to save  each of them  and any of  their
agents harmless,  then,  subject to Sections  3.1(b),  3.1(c) and 5.1 and in the
absence  of  notice  to the  Company  or  the  Rights  Agent  that  such  Rights
Certificate  has been  acquired  by a BONA FIDE  purchaser,  the  Company  shall
execute and upon its request the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver,  in
lieu of any such  destroyed,  lost or stolen  Rights  Certificate,  a new Rights
Certificate  evidencing the same number of Rights as did the Rights  Certificate
so destroyed, lost or stolen.


          (c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Rights Certificate under
this  Section 2.8,  the Company may require the payment of a sum  sufficient  to
cover any tax or other  charge that may be imposed in  relation  thereto and any
other expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent)  connected
therewith.

          (d) Every new Rights  Certificate  issued pursuant to this Section 2.8
in lieu of any destroyed,  lost or stolen Rights  Certificate  shall evidence an
original additional  contractual  obligation of the Company,  whether or not the
destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by
anyone,  and, subject to Section 3.1(b) shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Agreement  equally and  proportionately  with any and all other Rights duly
issued hereunder.

          2.9  PERSONS  DEEMED  OWNERS.  Prior  to due  presentment  of a Rights
Certificate  (or,  prior to the Separation  Time,  the  associated  Common Share
certificate or
                                       15
<PAGE>






notice of  transfer,  if  uncertificated)  for  registration  of  transfer,  the
Company,  the Rights  Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may
deem and treat the person in whose name such Rights  Certificate  (or,  prior to
the Separation Time, such Common Share certificate or Common Share registration,
if uncertificated) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights
evidenced  thereby for all  purposes  whatsoever,  including  the payment of the
Redemption  Price and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected
by any notice to the  contrary.  As used in this  Agreement,  unless the context
otherwise  requires,  the term "holder" of any Rights shall mean the  registered
holder of such Rights (or, prior to the Separation  Time, the associated  Common
Shares).


          2.10   DELIVERY  AND   CANCELLATION   OF   CERTIFICATES.   All  Rights
Certificates  surrendered  upon  exercise  or for  registration  of  transfer or
exchange  shall,  if surrendered  to any Person other than the Rights Agent,  be
delivered to the Rights Agent and, in any case,  shall be promptly  cancelled by
the Rights  Agent.  The Company may at any time  deliver to the Rights Agent for
cancellation  any Rights  Certificates  previously  countersigned  and delivered
hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,  and all
Rights  Certificates  so  delivered  shall be promptly  cancelled  by the Rights
Agent. No Rights  Certificates  shall be countersigned in lieu of or in exchange
for any Rights  Certificates  cancelled as provided in this Section 2.10, except
as expressly  permitted by this  Agreement.  The Rights Agent shall  destroy all
cancelled  Rights  Certificates  and deliver a certificate of destruction to the
Company.

          2.11 AGREEMENT OF RIGHTS HOLDERS.  Every holder of Rights by accepting
the same  consents  and agrees with the  Company  and the Rights  Agent and with
every other holder of Rights that:

          (a)    prior to the Separation Time, each Right will be transferable
only together  with,  and will be  transferred  by a transfer of, the associated
Common Share;

          (b)    after the Separation Time, the Rights  Certificates  will be
 transferable  only on the Rights Register as provided herein;

          (c)    prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to
the Separation  Time, the  associated  Common Share  certificate or Common Share
registration,  if uncertificated) for registration of transfer, the Company, the
Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat
the person in whose name the Rights  Certificate  (or,  prior to the  Separation
Time, the associated Common Share certificate or Common Share  registration,  if
uncertificated)  is registered  as the absolute  owner thereof and of the Rights
evidenced thereby for all purposes  whatsoever,  and neither the Company nor the
Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary;

          (d)    Rights  beneficially owned by certain Persons will, under the
 circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(b), become null and void; and

                                       16
<PAGE>



          (e)    this  Agreement  may be  supplemented  or amended from time to
 time pursuant to Section 2.4(b) or 5.4 hereof.


                                   ARTICLE III
                          ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RIGHTS IN
                        THE EVENT OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

          3.1  FLIP-IN  (a) In the event  that  prior to the  Expiration  Time a
Flip-in  Date shall occur,  except as provided in this  Section 3.1,  each Right
shall  constitute the right to purchase from the Company,  upon exercise thereof
in accordance  with the terms hereof (but subject to Section 5.10),  that number
of one  one-thousandths  of a share of  Preferred  Stock equal to that number of
shares  of  Common  Stock,  having  an  aggregate  Market  Price  on  the  Stock
Acquisition  Date that gave rise to the Flip-in Date equal to twice the Exercise
Price  for an amount  in cash  equal to the  Exercise  Price  (such  right to be
appropriately  adjusted  in order to protect  the  interests  of the  holders of
Rights  generally in the event that on or after such Stock  Acquisition Date any
of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event,  shall
have occurred with respect to the Common Shares).

          (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  Rights  that  are or  were
Beneficially Owned on or after the Stock Acquisition Date by an Acquiring Person
or an Affiliate or Associate  thereof or by any transferee,  direct or indirect,
of any of the foregoing shall become null and void and any holder of such Rights
(including  transferees)  shall thereafter have no right to exercise or transfer
such Rights under any provision of this Agreement.  If any Rights Certificate is
presented for assignment or exercise and the Person presenting the same will not
complete the  certification  set forth at the end of the form of  assignment  or
notice of election  to exercise  and  provide  such  additional  evidence of the
identity of the  Beneficial  Owner and its  Affiliates and Associates (or former
Beneficial  Owners and their  Affiliates  and  Associates)  as the Company shall
reasonably request,  then the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the
Beneficial  Owner thereof to be an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate
thereof or a transferee of any of the foregoing  and  accordingly  will deem the
Rights  evidenced   thereby  to  be  null  and  void  and  not  transferable  or
exercisable.

          (c) The Board of Directors  of the Company may, at its option,  at any
time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person becomes
the  Beneficial  Owner of more than 50% of the  outstanding  voting power of the
Common Shares elect to exchange all (but not less than all) the then outstanding
Rights  (which shall not include  Rights that have become null and void pursuant
to the  provisions  of Section  3.1(b))  for shares of  Preferred  Stock,  at an
exchange ratio of one  one-thousandth  of a share of Preferred Stock, per Right,
appropriately  adjusted in order to protect the  interests  of holders of Rights
generally in the event that after the Stock  Acquisition  Date any of the events
described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have


                                       17
<PAGE>



occurred with respect to the Common  Shares (such  exchange  ratio,  as adjusted
from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio").

          Immediately  upon the action of the Board of  Directors of the Company
electing to  exchange  the  Rights,  without any further  action and without any
notice,  the right to exercise the Rights will  terminate  and each Right (other
than Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)),  whether
or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive
a number  of one  one-thousandths  of a share of  Preferred  Stock  equal to the
Exchange Ratio.  Promptly after the action of the Board of Directors electing to
exchange the Rights,  the Company shall give written notice thereof  (specifying
the steps to be taken to receive  Common  Shares in exchange  for Rights) to the
Rights  Agent and the holders of the Rights  (other than Rights that have become
void  pursuant  to Section  3.1(b))  outstanding  immediately  prior  thereto by
mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.

          Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued (or for
whom any  registration  on the stock transfer books of the Company is made) upon
the exchange of Rights  pursuant to this Section  3.1(c) or Section 3.1(d) shall
for all  purposes  be deemed to have  become  the holder of record of the shares
represented  thereby  on, and such  certificate  (or  registration  on the stock
transfer  books of the Company)  shall be dated (or  registered  as of) the date
upon which the Rights  Certificate  evidencing such Rights was duly  surrendered
and payment of any applicable  taxes and other charges payable by the holder was
made;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that if the date of such  surrender and payment is a
date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed,  such Person
shall be deemed to have  become  the record  holder of such  shares on, and such
certificate  (or  registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) shall
be dated (or  registered  as of) the next  succeeding  Business Day on which the
stock transfer books of the Company are open.

          (d) Whenever the Company shall become  obligated  under Section 3.1(a)
or (c) to issue a share (or fractional  share) of Preferred  Stock upon exercise
of or in exchange  for  Rights,  the  Company,  to the extent  permitted  by the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation,  as amended, at its option, may
substitute  therefor  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  Class B  Common  Stock,  as
applicable,  at a ratio of one share of Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as
applicable,  for  each  one-thousandth  of a share  of the  Preferred  Stock  so
issuable.

          (e) In the event that there shall not be sufficient treasury shares or
authorized  but  unissued  Common  Shares or  Preferred  Stock of the Company to
permit the exercise or exchange in full of the Rights in accordance with Section
3.1(a) or if the Company so elects,  to make the exchange referred to in Section
3.1(c),  the Company  shall  either (i) call a meeting of  stockholders  seeking
approval to cause sufficient  additional shares to be authorized  (provided that
if such  approval is not obtained the Company will take the action  specified in
clause (ii) of this sentence) or (ii) take such


                                       18
<PAGE>

action as shall be necessary to ensure and provide,  to the extent  permitted by
applicable  law and  any  agreements  or  instruments  in  effect  on the  Stock
Acquisition  Date to which it is a  party,  that  each  Right  shall  thereafter
constitute  the right to receive,  (x) at the  Company's  option,  either (A) in
return for the Exercise Price,  debt or equity  securities or other assets (or a
combination  thereof)  having a fair value equal to twice the Exercise Price, or
(B) without payment of consideration (except as otherwise required by applicable
law),  debt or equity  securities  or other  assets (or a  combination  thereof)
having  a fair  value  equal  to the  Exercise  Price,  or (y) if the  Board  of
Directors  of the  Company  elects to  exchange  the Rights in  accordance  with
Section  3.1(c),  debt or equity  securities  or other assets (or a  combination
thereof) having a fair value equal to the product of the Market Price of a share
of Common Stock on the Flip-in  Date times the  Exchange  Ratio in effect on the
Flip-in Date,  where in any case set forth in (x) or (y) above the fair value of
such debt or equity  securities  or other assets shall be as  determined in good
faith by the  Board of  Directors  of the  Company,  after  consultation  with a
nationally recognized investment banking firm.

          3.2 FLIP-OVER. (a) Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company shall not
enter into any  agreement  with  respect to,  consummate  or permit to occur any
Flip-over  Transaction  or Event  unless and until it shall have  entered into a
supplemental agreement with the Flip-over Entity, for the benefit of the holders
of the Rights,  providing that, upon consummation or occurrence of the Flip-over
Transaction  or Event (i) the  Flip-over  Entity will have duly  authorized  and
available  for issuance  sufficient  shares of (x)  Flip-over  Stock and (y) the
classes of common equity securities into which the shares of Flip-over Stock are
convertible,  (ii) each Right shall thereafter  constitute the right to purchase
from the Flip-over  Entity,  upon exercise  thereof in accordance with the terms
hereof,  that  number of shares of  Series A  Flip-over  Stock of the  Flip-over
Entity having an aggregate Market Price (based on the Market Price of the Common
Stock in the  Reference  Package) on the date of  consummation  or occurrence of
such  Flip-over  Transaction  or Event equal to twice the Exercise Price for the
Right for an  amount in cash  equal to the  Exercise  Price for the Right  (such
right to be  appropriately  adjusted  in order to protect the  interests  of the
holders of Rights generally in the event that after such date of consummation or
occurrence  any of the  events  described  in  Section  2.4(a)  or  (b),  or any
analogous  event,  shall have occurred with respect to the Flip-over  Stock) and
(iii) the Flip-over Entity shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume,  by
virtue of such Flip-over  Transaction or Event and such supplemental  agreement,
all the  obligations and duties of the Company  pursuant to this Agreement.  The
provisions of this Section 3.2 shall apply to successive Flip-over  Transactions
or Events.

          (b) Prior to the Expiration  Time,  unless the Rights will be redeemed
pursuant to Section  5.1 hereof  pursuant to an  agreement  entered  into by the
Company prior to a Flip-in Date,  the Company shall not enter into any agreement
with respect to,  consummate  or permit to occur any  Flip-over  Transaction  or
Event if at the time  thereof  there  are any  rights,  warrants  or  securities
outstanding  or any other  arrangements,  agreements or  instruments  that would
eliminate or otherwise diminish in any material

                                       19
<PAGE>





respect the  benefits  intended to be afforded by this Rights  Agreement  to the
holders of Rights upon consummation of such transaction.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                THE RIGHTS AGENT

          4.1 GENERAL.  (a) The Company hereby  appoints the Rights Agent to act
as agent for the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and
the Rights Agent hereby accepts such  appointment.  The Company agrees to pay to
the  Rights  Agent  reasonable  compensation  for all  services  rendered  by it
hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent,  its reasonable
expenses and counsel fees and other  disbursements  incurred in the preparation,
execution,  delivery,  administration  and  amendment of this  Agreement and the
exercise and  performance  of its duties  hereunder.  The Company also agrees to
indemnify  the Rights  Agent for,  and to hold it  harmless  against,  any loss,
liability,  damage, judgment, fine, penalty, claim, settlement, cost or expense,
incurred without gross negligence,  bad faith or willful  misconduct on the part
of the Rights  Agent (which gross  negligence,  bad faith or willful  misconduct
must be  determined  by an  order,  judgment,  decree  or  ruling  of a court of
competent jurisdiction), for any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Rights
Agent in connection  with the acceptance and  administration  of this Agreement,
including  without  limitation  the costs and expenses of defending  against any
claim of liability.  The indemnity provided herein shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the  termination  and expiration of the Rights.  The costs
and expenses  incurred in successfully  enforcing this right of  indemnification
shall be paid by the Company.

          (b) The Rights Agent shall be  protected  and shall incur no liability
for or in respect of any action  taken,  suffered or omitted by it in connection
with its  acceptance and  administration  of this Agreement in reliance upon any
certificate  for securities (or  registration on the stock transfer books of the
Company)  purchasable upon exercise of Rights,  Rights Certificate,  certificate
for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power
of  attorney,  endorsement,   affidavit,  letter,  notice,  direction,  consent,
certificate,  statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to be signed,  executed and, where necessary,  verified or acknowledged,  by
the proper  person or persons,  or  otherwise  upon the advice of counsel as set
forth in Section 4.3 hereof.

          4.2 MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OR CHANGE OF NAME OF RIGHTS AGENT. (a) Any
Person into which the Rights Agent or any  successor  Rights Agent may be merged
or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or
consolidation  to which the  Rights  Agent or any  successor  Rights  Agent is a
party,  or any Person  succeeding to the  shareholder  services  business of the
Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent,  will be the successor to the Rights
Agent under this  Agreement  without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,  provided that such Person
would be eligible for appointment as a successor

                                       20
<PAGE>

Rights  Agent under the  provisions  of Section 4.4 hereof.  In case at the time
such successor Rights Agent succeeds to the agency created by this Agreement any
of the Rights  Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered,  any such
successor Rights Agent may adopt the  countersignature of the predecessor Rights
Agent and deliver such Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that
time any of the Rights Certificates have not been  countersigned,  any successor
Rights Agent may countersign such Rights  Certificates either in the name of the
predecessor  Rights Agent or in the name of the successor  Rights Agent;  and in
all such cases such Rights Certificates will have the full force provided in the
Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.



          (b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent is changed and at
such time any of the Rights  Certificates  shall have been countersigned but not
delivered,  the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name
and deliver Rights  Certificates so countersigned;  and in case at that time any
of the Rights Certificates shall not have been  countersigned,  the Rights Agent
may  countersign  such  Rights  Certificates  either in its prior name or in its
changed name; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full
force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.

          4.3 DUTIES OF RIGHTS  AGENT.  The  Rights  Agent  undertakes  only the
duties  and  obligations  expressly  imposed by this  Agreement  (and no implied
duties or obligations) upon the following terms and conditions,  by all of which
the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof,
shall be bound:

          (a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal  counsel (who may be legal
counsel for the Company or an employee of the Rights  Agent),  and the advice or
opinion of such counsel will be full and complete  authorization  and protection
to the Rights  Agent and the Rights  Agent  shall incur no  liability  for or in
respect of any action  taken,  suffered by it or omitted by it in good faith and
in accordance with such advice or opinion.

          (b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the
Rights Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter (including,
without  limitation,  the identity of any Acquiring Person and the determination
of Market  Price)  be proved or  established  by the  Company  prior to  taking,
suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder,  such fact or matter (unless
other  evidence in respect  thereof be herein  specifically  prescribed)  may be
deemed to be conclusively  proved and  established by a certificate  signed by a
person  believed  by the  Rights  Agent to be the  Chairman  of the  Board,  the
President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer or any Assistant  Treasurer
or the Secretary or any Assistant  Secretary of the Company and delivered to the
Rights Agent; and such certificate will be full  authorization and protection to
the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect
of any  action  taken,  suffered  or  omitted  in good  faith  by it  under  the
provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.

                                       21
<PAGE>



          (c) The Rights Agent will be liable  hereunder  only for its own gross
negligence,  bad faith or willful misconduct (which gross negligence,  bad faith
or willful misconduct must be determined by an order, judgment, decree or ruling
of a court of competent jurisdiction). Anything to the contrary notwithstanding,
in no event shall the Rights  Agent be liable for special,  punitive,  indirect,
consequential or incidental loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost  profits),  even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage.

          (d) The Rights Agent will not be liable for or by reason of any of the
statements  of  fact  or  recitals   contained  in  this  Agreement  or  in  the
certificates,  if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or the
Rights  Certificates  (except  its  countersignature  thereof) or be required to
verify the same, but all such  statements and recitals are and will be deemed to
have been made by the Company only.

          (e)  The  Rights  Agent  will  have  no  liability  nor be  under  any
responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and
delivery hereof (except the due authorization,  execution and delivery hereof by
the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any certificate,
if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or Rights Certificate
(except its countersignature thereof); nor will it be responsible for any breach
by the Company of any  covenant or condition  contained in this  Agreement or in
any  Rights  Certificate;  nor  will it be  responsible  for any  change  in the
exercisability  of the  Rights  (including  the  Rights  becoming  null and void
pursuant  to  Section  3.1(b)  hereof)  or any  adjustment  required  under  the
provisions  of Section  2.4,  3.1 or 3.2 hereof or  responsible  for the manner,
method or amount of any such adjustment or the  ascertaining of the existence of
facts  that  would  require  any such  adjustment  (except  with  respect to the
exercise of Rights after receipt of the certificate  contemplated by Section 2.4
describing any such  adjustment);  nor will it by any act hereunder be deemed to
make any  representation  or warranty as to the  authorization or reservation of
any  securities  purchasable  upon  exercise  of Rights  or any  Rights or as to
whether any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights will, when issued, be
duly and validly authorized,  executed,  issued and delivered and fully paid and
nonassessable.

          (f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute,  acknowledge and
deliver or cause to be performed, executed,  acknowledged and delivered all such
further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required
by the Rights Agent for the carrying  out or  performing  by the Rights Agent of
the provisions of this Agreement.

          (g) The  Rights  Agent is hereby  authorized  and  directed  to accept
advice or instructions  with respect to the performance of its duties  hereunder
from any person  believed by the Rights  Agent to be the  Chairman of the Board,
the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or any Assistant  Secretary
or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such
persons for advice or

                                       22
<PAGE>

instructions  in  connection  with its duties,  and such advice or  instructions
shall be full  authorization  and  protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights
Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action  taken,  suffered
or omitted by it in good faith in accordance  with the advice or instructions of
any such person.

          (h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, affiliate, director, officer
or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in Common Stock, Rights or
other  securities  of  the  Company  or  become  pecuniarily  interested  in any
transaction  in which the Company may be  interested,  or contract  with or lend
money to the Company or otherwise  act as fully and freely as though it were not
Rights Agent under this  Agreement.  Nothing  herein  shall  preclude the Rights
Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any Person.

          (i) The Rights  Agent may  execute and  exercise  any of the rights or
powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder  either itself or by or
through its attorneys or agents,  and the Rights Agent will not be answerable or
accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or
agents or for any loss to the  Company  resulting  from any such  act,  default,
neglect or misconduct, absent gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct
(which gross negligence,  bad faith or willful  misconduct must be determined by
an order,  judgment,  decree or ruling of a court of competent  jurisdiction) in
the selection and continued employment thereof.

          (j) No provision of this  Agreement  shall require the Rights Agent to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise  incur any financial  liability in the
performance of any of its duties or obligations  hereunder or in the exercise of
its  rights  if  it  believes   that   repayment   of  such  funds  or  adequate
indemnification against such risk or liability is not assured to it.

          4.4  CHANGE OF RIGHTS  AGENT.  The  Rights  Agent  may  resign  and be
discharged  from its duties under this  Agreement  upon 30 days' notice (or such
lesser notice as is acceptable to the Company) in writing  mailed to the Company
and to each transfer agent of Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and
to the holders of the Rights in  accordance  with  Section  5.9. The Company may
remove the Rights  Agent upon 30 days'  notice in writing,  mailed to the Rights
Agent and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified
mail,  and to the holders of the Rights in  accordance  with Section 5.9. If the
Rights  Agent  should  resign or be removed or  otherwise  become  incapable  of
acting, the Company will appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company
fails to make such appointment  within a period of 30 days after such removal or
after it has been notified in writing of such  resignation  or incapacity by the
resigning or  incapacitated  Rights Agent or by the holder of any Rights  (which
holder shall,  with such notice,  submit such holder's  Rights  Certificate  for
inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Rights may apply to any court
of  competent  jurisdiction  for the  appointment  of a new  Rights  Agent.  Any
successor  Rights  Agent,  whether  appointed by the Company or by such a court,
shall be (a) a Person organized

                                       23
<PAGE>

and  doing  business  under  the laws of the  United  States or any state of the
United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise
the powers of the Rights Agent  contemplated by this Agreement and is subject to
supervision or  examination  by federal or state  authority and which has at the
time of its  appointment  as Rights  Agent a combined  capital and surplus of at
least  $50,000,000  or (b) an Affiliate  of a Person  described in clause (a) of
this  sentence  that is under  control of such Person.  After  appointment,  the
successor Rights Agent will be vested with the same powers,  rights,  duties and
responsibilities  as if it had been  originally  named as Rights  Agent  without
further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer
to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and
execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for
the purpose.  Not later than the  effective  date of any such  appointment,  the
Company will file notice  thereof in writing with the  predecessor  Rights Agent
and each  transfer  agent of the  Common  Shares,  and mail a notice  thereof in
writing to the holders of the Rights. Failure to give any notice provided for in
this Section 4.4, however, or any defect therein,  shall not affect the legality
or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment
of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.

                                    ARTICLE V
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          5.1 REDEMPTION.  (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its
option, at any time prior to the Flip-in Date, elect to redeem all (but not less
than all) the then  outstanding  Rights at the Redemption Price and the Company,
at its option,  may pay the Redemption  Price either in cash or other securities
of the Company  deemed by the Board of  Directors,  in the  exercise of its sole
discretion, to be at least equivalent in value to the Redemption Price.

          (b)  Immediately  upon the  action  of the Board of  Directors  of the
Company  electing to redeem the Rights (or,  if the  resolution  of the Board of
Directors  electing to redeem the Rights states that the redemption  will not be
effective  until the  occurrence of a specified  future time or event,  upon the
occurrence of such future time or event), without any further action and without
any notice,  the right to exercise  the Rights  will  terminate  and each Right,
whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Redemption  Price in cash or securities,  as determined by the Board
of Directors.  Promptly  after the Rights are  redeemed,  the Company shall give
written  notice of such  redemption  to the Rights  Agent and the holders of the
then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.

          5.2      EXPIRATION.  The Rights and this  Agreement  shall  expire at
the  Expiration  Time and no Personshall have any rights pursuant to this
Agreement or any

                                       24
<PAGE>



Right  after the  Expiration  Time,  except,  if the  Rights  are  exchanged  or
redeemed, as provided in Section 3.1 or 5.1 hereof , respectively.

          5.3 ISSUANCE OF NEW RIGHTS  CERTIFICATES.  Notwithstanding  any of the
provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary,  the Company may,
at its option,  issue new Rights Certificates  evidencing Rights in such form as
may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in
the  number or kind or class of shares of stock  purchasable  upon  exercise  of
Rights made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in
connection  with the issuance or sale of Common Shares by the Company  following
the Separation  Time and prior to the  Expiration  Time pursuant to the terms of
securities  convertible  or  redeemable  into Common Shares (other than any such
securities  issued or issuable in  connection  with the  exercise or exchange of
Rights or upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock after the Separation
Time) or to options,  in each case issued or granted  prior to, and  outstanding
at, the  Separation  Time, the Company shall issue to the holders of such Common
Shares,  Rights  Certificates  representing the appropriate  number of Rights in
connection with the issuance or sale of such Common Shares;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
in each case,  (i) no such Rights  Certificate  shall be issued,  if, and to the
extent that,  the Company shall be advised by counsel that such  issuance  would
create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or
to the Person to whom such  Rights  Certificates  would be issued,  (ii) no such
Rights  Certificates  shall be issued if, and to the  extent  that,  appropriate
adjustment shall have otherwise been made in lieu of the issuance  thereof,  and
(iii) the Company shall have no obligation to distribute Rights  Certificates to
any  Acquiring  Person or Affiliate  or Associate of an Acquiring  Person or any
transferee of any of the foregoing.

          5.4 SUPPLEMENTS  AND AMENDMENTS.  The Company and the Rights Agent may
from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any
holders of Rights (i) prior to the Flip-in  Date,  in any respect and (ii) on or
after the Flip-in Date, to make any changes that the Company may deem  necessary
or desirable and which shall not  materially  adversely  affect the interests of
the holders of Rights  generally or in order to cure any ambiguity or to correct
or supplement any provision  contained herein which may be inconsistent with any
other  provisions  herein or otherwise  defective.  The Rights Agent will,  upon
delivery of a  certificate  from an  appropriate  officer of the  Company  which
states that the proposed supplement or amendment complies with this Section 5.4,
duly execute and deliver any  supplement  or amendment  hereto  requested by the
Company which satisfies the terms of the preceding  sentence,  provided that any
supplement or amendment shall become effective immediately upon execution by the
Company,  whether  or not also  executed  by the Rights  Agent.  Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,  the Rights Agent may, but
shall not be obligated to, enter into any  supplement or amendment  that affects
only  the  rights,  duties,  obligations  or  indemnities  of the  Rights  Agent
hereunder.

                                       25

          5.5 FRACTIONAL SHARES. If the Company elects not to issue certificates
representing (or register on the stock transfer books of the Company) fractional
shares upon exercise,  exchange or redemption of Rights,  the Company shall,  in
lieu  thereof,  in the sole  discretion  of its Board of  Directors,  either (a)
evidence such  fractional  shares by depositary  receipts  issued pursuant to an
appropriate  agreement  between  the Company  and a  depositary  selected by it,
providing that each holder of a depositary receipt shall have all of the rights,
privileges  and  preferences  to  which  such  holder  would  be  entitled  as a
beneficial owner of such fractional  share, or (b) pay to the registered  holder
of such Rights the appropriate fraction of the Market Price per share in cash.

          5.6  RIGHTS  OF  ACTION.  Subject  to  the  terms  of  this  Agreement
(including  Sections  3.1(b)  and  5.14),  rights of action in  respect  of this
Agreement,  other than rights of action vested  solely in the Rights Agent,  are
vested in the  respective  holders of the Rights;  and any holder of any Rights,
without  the consent of the Rights  Agent or of the holder of any other  Rights,
may,  on such  holder's  own behalf and for such  holder's  own  benefit and the
benefit of other holders of Rights,  enforce, and may institute and maintain any
suit, action or proceeding  against the Company to enforce,  or otherwise act in
respect of, such holder's  right to exercise such holder's  Rights in the manner
provided in such holder's  Rights  Certificate  and in this  Agreement.  Without
limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is
specifically  acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate
remedy at law for any breach of this  Agreement and will be entitled to specific
performance of the obligations  under,  and injunctive  relief against actual or
threatened  violations  of,  the  obligations  of any  Person  subject  to  this
Agreement.

          5.7 HOLDER OF RIGHTS NOT DEEMED A STOCKHOLDER.  No holder, as such, of
any Rights  shall be entitled to vote,  receive  dividends  or be deemed for any
purpose  the holder of shares or any other  securities  which may at any time be
issuable on the exercise of such Rights,  nor shall anything contained herein or
in any Rights  Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Rights,
as such,  any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote
for the election of directors or upon any matter  submitted to  stockholders  at
any meeting thereof,  or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or
to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as
provided in Section 5.8 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights,
or  otherwise,  until such Rights  shall have been  exercised  or  exchanged  in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

          5.8 NOTICE OF PROPOSED  ACTIONS.  In case the Company shall propose on
or after the Separation  Time and prior to the Expiration  Time (i) to effect or
permit a  Flip-over  Transaction  or Event or (ii) to  effect  the  liquidation,
dissolution  or winding up of the Company,  then, in each such case, the Company
shall give to each holder of a Right, in accordance  with Section 5.9 hereof,  a
notice of such  proposed  action,  which  shall  specify  the date on which such
Flip-over Transaction or Event, liquidation, dissolution,
                                       26

determines  in good faith that some  action  will or need be taken  pursuant  to
Section 3.1 or to comply with federal or state  securities laws, the Company may
suspend the  exercisability  of the Rights for a  reasonable  period in order to
take such action or comply with

                                       27

exchangeability  of the  Rights  has been  temporarily  suspended  (with  prompt
written notice thereof to the Rights Agent).  Notice thereof pursuant to Section
5.9 shall not be required.

Agreement and this Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive  benefit of the
Company, the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights.

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                  This  certifies  that   ____________________,   or  registered
assigns,  is the registered holder of the number of Rights set forth above, each
of  which  entitles  the  registered  holder  thereof,  subject  to  the  terms,
provisions and conditions of the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement,  dated
as of December 15, 2000 (as amended from time to time, the "RIGHTS  AGREEMENT"),
between Hershey Foods Corporation,  a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"),  and
Mellon Investor Services LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company,  as Rights
Agent (the "RIGHTS AGENT",  which term shall include any successor  Rights Agent
under the Rights Agreement),  to purchase from the Company at any time after the
Separation  Time (as such term is defined in the Rights  Agreement) and prior to
the close of business on December 15, 2010, one  one-thousandth  of a fully paid
share of Series A Participating  Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
"SERIES A PREFERRED  STOCK"),  of the Company (subject to adjustment as provided
in  the  Rights  Agreement)  at the  Exercise  Price  referred  to  below,  upon
presentation and surrender of this Rights  Certificate with the Form of Election
to Exercise duly executed at the office of the Rights Agent  designated for such
purpose.  The  Exercise  Price  shall  initially  be $270 per Right and shall be

          Under certain  circumstances,  each one  one-thousandth  of a share of
Series A Preferred  Stock held by a holder of a share of Class B Common Stock at
the Separation  Time may be converted at the election of the holder thereof into
one  one-thousandth  of a fully paid share of Series B  Participating  Preferred

Company. The procedures to be followed and


<PAGE>


  limitations on effecting such  conversion are set forth in the  Certificate of
Designation and Terms of the Series A Preferred Stock.

          In certain circumstances described in the Rights Agreement, the Rights
evidenced  hereby  may  entitle  the  registered   holder  thereof  to  purchase
securities  of an entity  other than the  Company or  securities  of the Company
other than Series A Preferred Stock or assets of the Company, all as provided in
the Rights Agreement.

          This Rights Certificate is subject to all of the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Rights Agreement,  which terms,  provisions and conditions are
hereby  incorporated  herein by  reference  and made a part  hereof and to which
Rights Agreement  reference is hereby made for a full description of the rights,
limitations  of rights,  obligations,  duties and  immunities  hereunder  of the
Rights Agent, the Company and the holders of the Rights Certificates.  Copies of
the Rights  Agreement are on file at the principal office of the Company and are
available without cost upon written request.

          This Rights  Certificate,  with or without other Rights  Certificates,
upon  surrender at the office of the Rights Agent  designated  for such purpose,
may be exchanged for another Rights  Certificate or Rights  Certificates of like
tenor  evidencing an aggregate number of Rights equal to the aggregate number of
Rights evidenced by the Rights Certificate or Rights  Certificates  surrendered.
If this Rights  Certificate  shall be exercised in part, the  registered  holder
shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender hereof,  another Rights Certificate
or Rights Certificates for the number of whole Rights not exercised.

          Subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Rights  Agreement,  each  Right
evidenced by this Rights  Certificate  may be (a) redeemed by the Company  under
certain  circumstances,  at its option, at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right
or (b) exchanged by the Company under certain circumstances,  at its option, for
one  share  of  Common  Stock or Class B Common  Stock,  as  applicable,  or one
one-thousandth  of a share of Series A Preferred Stock per Right (or, in certain
cases,  other  securities  or assets of the  Company),  subject  in each case to
adjustment in certain events as provided in the Rights Agreement.

          No holder of this Rights  Certificate,  as such,  shall be entitled to
vote or  receive  dividends  or be  deemed  for any  purpose  the  holder of any
securities which may at any time be issuable on the exercise  hereof,  nor shall
anything contained in the Rights Agreement or herein be construed to confer upon
the holder hereof, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or
any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter  submitted to
stockholders  at any  meeting  thereof,  or to give or  withhold  consent to any
corporate  action,  or to receive notice of meetings or other actions  affecting
stockholders  (except  as  provided  in the  Rights  Agreement),  or to  receive
dividends or subscription  rights,  or otherwise,  until the Rights evidenced by
this Rights  Certificate  shall have been  exercised or exchanged as provided in

                     Pursuant to Section 151 of the General
                     Corporation Law of the State of Delware


          We,     the     undersigned,      ____________________     and
____________________, the ____________________, and __________, respectively, of
Hershey Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "CORPORATION"), do hereby
certify as follows:

          Pursuant  to  authority  granted  by  Article  FOURTH of the  Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation,  as amended,  and in accordance
with the provisions of Section 151 of the General  Corporation  Law of the State
of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has adopted the following
resolutions  fixing the designation and certain terms,  powers,  preferences and
other rights of a new series of the  Corporation's  Preferred  Stock,  par value
$1.00 per  share,  and  certain  qualifications,  limitations  and  restrictions
thereon:

          RESOLVED,  that  there is hereby  established  a series  of  Preferred
     Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the  Corporation,  and the designation
     and certain terms,  powers,  preferences  and other rights of the shares of
     such  series,  and certain  qualifications,  limitations  and  restrictions
     thereon, are hereby fixed as follows:

                       (i) The  distinctive  serial  designation  of this series
                  shall be "Series A Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter
                  called  "THIS  SERIES").  Each share of this  Series  shall be
                  identical in all respects with the other shares of this Series
                  except as to the dates from and after which dividends  thereon
                  shall be cumulative and except as otherwise herein provided.

                       (ii) The number of shares in this Series shall  initially
                  be _______, which number may from time to time be increased or
                  decreased (but not below the number then  outstanding)  by the
                  Board of  Directors.  Shares of this Series  purchased  by the
                  Corporation or converted into Common Stock or into a different
                  series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall be

<PAGE>



                  cancelled and shall revert to authorized  and designated as to
                  series, but unissued shares of Preferred Stock. Shares of this
                  Series  may be issued  in  fractional  shares  which are whole
                  number  multiples  of one  one-thousandth  of a  share,  which
                  fractional  shares shall entitle the holder,  in proportion to
                  such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a
                  whole share of this Series.

                       (iii) The  holders of full or  fractional  shares of this
                  Series  shall be entitled to receive,  when and as declared by
                  the  Board  of  Directors,  but  only  out  of  funds  legally
                  available therefor, dividends, (A) on each date that dividends
                  or other distributions  (other than dividends or distributions
                  payable in Common Stock of the  Corporation) are payable on or
                  in respect of Common Stock  comprising  part of the  Reference
                  Package  (as defined  below),  in an amount per whole share of
                  this Series  equal to the  aggregate  amount of  dividends  or
                  other  distributions  (other than  dividends or  distributions
                  payable  in Common  Stock of the  Corporation)  that  would be
                  payable on such date to a holder of the Reference  Package and
                  (B) on the last day of March, June,  September and December in
                  each year,  in an amount per whole share of this Series  equal
                  to the amount by which $10  exceeds  the  aggregate  dividends
                  paid per whole  share of this  Series  during the three  month
                  period ending on such last day.  Each such  dividend  shall be
                  paid to the  holders of record of shares of this Series on the
                  date,  not  exceeding  sixty days  preceding  such dividend or
                  distribution  payment date, fixed for the purpose by the Board
                  of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend
                  or  distribution.  Dividends on each full and each  fractional
                  share of this Series  shall be  cumulative  from the date such
                  full or fractional share is originally  issued;  provided that
                  any such full or fractional  share  originally  issued after a
                  dividend  record date and on or prior to the dividend  payment
                  date to which such record date  relates  shall not be entitled
                  to receive the dividend  payable on such dividend payment date
                  or any  amount in respect  of the  period  from such  original
                  issuance to such dividend payment date.

                                  The term  "Reference  Package" shall initially
                  mean 1000  shares of Common  Stock,  par value $1.00 per share
                  ("COMMON  STOCK"),  of  the  Corporation.  In  the  event  the
                  Corporation  shall at any time after the close of  business on
                  ________,  ____*/f1/  (A)  declare  or pay a  dividend  on any
                  Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (B) subdivide any Common
                  Stock or (C) combine any Common Stock into a smaller number

                  of shares,  then and in each such case the  Reference  Package
                  after  such event  shall be the Common  Stock that a holder of
                  the Reference  Package  immediately  prior to such event would
                  hold thereafter as a result thereof.




                                  Holders of shares of this Series  shall not be
                  entitled to any dividends,  whether payable in cash,  property
                  or stock,  in excess of full cumulative  dividends,  as herein
                  provided on this Series.  This Series shall rank pari passu in
                  all respects with the Series B  Participating  Preferred Stock
                  of the Company except with respect to voting rights.

                                  So  long as any  shares  of  this  Series  are
                  outstanding,  no  dividend  (other  than a dividend  in Common
                  Stock or in any other stock  ranking  junior to this Series as
                  to dividends and upon  liquidation)  shall be declared or paid
                  or set aside for  payment or other  distribution  declared  or
                  made upon the Common Stock or Class B Common Stock or upon any
                  other stock  ranking  junior to this Series as to dividends or
                  upon  liquidation,   unless  the  full  cumulative   dividends
                  (including  the  dividend  to be  paid  upon  payment  of such
                  dividend or other  distribution) on all outstanding  shares of
                  this Series shall have been,  or shall  contemporaneously  be,
                  paid. When dividends are not paid in full upon this Series and
                  any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends  with this
                  Series,  all dividends declared upon shares of this Series and
                  any other stock  ranking on a parity as to dividends  shall be
                  declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends
                  declared  per share on this  Series and such other stock shall
                  bear to each other the same ratio that  accumulated  dividends
                  per share on the shares of the  Series  and such  other  stock
                  bear to each other. Neither the Common Stock or Class B Common
                  Stock nor any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to
                  or on a  parity  with  this  Series  as to  dividends  or upon
                  liquidation may be redeemed,  purchased or otherwise  acquired
                  for  any  consideration  (or  any  moneys  be  paid to or made
                  available for a sinking fund for the  redemption of any shares
                  of any such stock) by the  Corporation  (except by  conversion
                  into or exchange for stock of the  Corporation  ranking junior
                  to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation),  unless,
                  in each case,  the full  cumulative  dividends  (including the
                  dividend   to  be  due   upon   payment   of  such   dividend,
                  distribution,  redemption,  purchase or other  acquisition) on
                  all  outstanding  shares of this  Series  shall have been,  or
                  shall contemporaneously be, paid.

                       (iv)  In  the   event  of  any   merger,   consolidation,
                  reclassification  or other  transaction  in which  the  Common
                  Shares  are  exchanged  for or  changed  into  other  stock or
                  securities,  cash and/or any other property,  then in any such
                  case the  shares  of this  Series  shall  at the same  time be
                  similarly  exchanged  or changed in an amount per whole  share
                  equal to the  aggregate  amount  of  stock,  securities,  cash
                  and/or any other property

                   Reference Package would be entitled to receive as a result of
                   such transaction.

                       (v)  In the  event  of any  liquidation,  dissolution  or
                  winding  up  of  the  affairs  of  the  Corporation,   whether
                  voluntary or  involuntary,  the holders of full and fractional
                  shares  of  this  Series   shall  be   entitled,   before  any
                  distribution  or payment is made on any date to the holders of
                  the Common Stock or Class B Common Stock or any other stock of
                  the   Corporation   ranking   junior  to  this   Series   upon
                  liquidation,  to be paid in full an amount per whole  share of
                  this Series  equal to the greater of (A)  $__________*/f2/  or
                  (B) the aggregate  amount  distributed or to be distributed in
                  connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up to
                  a holder of the Reference  Package (such greater  amount being
                  hereinafter  referred  to as  the  "Liquidation  Preference"),
                  together  with  accrued  dividends  to  such  distribution  or
                  payment  date,  whether  or not  earned or  declared.  If such
                  payment  shall have been made in full to all holders of shares
                  of this  Series,  the holders of shares of this Series as such
                  shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of
                  the Corporation.

                                  In the  event the  assets  of the  Corporation
                  available  for  distribution  to the holders of shares of this
                  Series upon any liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the
                  Corporation,   whether  voluntary  or  involuntary,  shall  be
                  insufficient  to pay in full all amounts to which such holders
                  are entitled  pursuant to the first  paragraph of this Section
                  (v),  no such  distribution  shall be made on  account  of any
                  shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking
                  on  a  parity  with  the  shares  of  this  Series  upon  such
                  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up unless  proportionate
                  distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of
                  this Series,  ratably in proportion to the full  distributable

                  otherwise required by law, each share (or fraction thereof) of
                  this Series  shall,  on any  matter,  vote as a class with any
                  other capital stock  comprising part of the Reference  Package
                  and shall  have the number of votes  thereon  that a holder of
                  the Reference  Package (or a similar  fraction  thereof) would

                       (viii) To the extent  any  holder of this  Series was the
                  record holder of Class B Common Stock at the  Separation  Time
                  (a "CLASS B HOLDER"), as reflected in the stock transfer books
                  of the Company,  such holder may convert one one-thousandth of
                  a share of this Series for every share of Class B Common Stock
                  held as of Separation  Time at any time at the election of the
                  holder thereof into one  one-thousandth  of a fully paid share

                  one-thousandths  of a share of this  Series than the number of
                  shares of Class B Common  Stock held at the  Separation  Time.
                  Such  right  shall  be  exercised  by  the  surrender  of  the

                  and  (if  so  required  by  the  transfer   agent  or  by  the
                  Corporation) by instruments of transfer,  in form satisfactory
                  to the transfer agent and to the Corporation, duly executed by
                  such holder or his duly authorized attorney. The issuance of a
                  certificate or  certificates  for shares of Series B Preferred
                  Stock upon  conversion  of shares of this Series shall be made
                  without  charge for any stamp or other  similar tax in respect
                  of  such  issuance.   However,  if  any  such  certificate  or
                  certificates  is or are to be issued in a name other than that
                  of the holder of the share or shares of this Series converted,
                  the person or persons  requesting  the issuance  thereof shall
                  pay to the transfer agent or to the  Corporation the amount of
                  any tax which

                  establish to the  satisfaction of the transfer agent or of the
                  Corporation  that  such  tax has been  that  such tax has been
                  paid.  As  promptly as  practicable  after the  surrender  for
                  conversion  of  a  certificate  or  certificates  representing
                  shares  of  this   Series  and  the  payment  of  any  tax  as
                  hereinbefore   provided,    the   Corporation,    subject   to
                  verification of the Ownership Statement, will deliver or cause
                  to be  delivered  at the office of the  transfer  agent to, or

                  number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock issuable upon
                  such  conversion,  issued in such name or names as such holder
                  may direct.  Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
                  immediately  prior to the close of business on the date of the
                  surrender  of the  certificate  or  certificates  representing
                  shares of this Series (if on such date the  transfer  books of
                  the Corporation shall be closed, then immediately prior to the
                  close of business on the first date thereafter that said books
                  shall be open),  and all rights of such  holder  arising  from
                  ownership  of shares of this Series  shall cease at such time,
                  and  the  person  or  persons  in  whose  name  or  names  the
                  certificate or certificates  representing shares of the Series
                  B  Preferred  Stock are to be issued  shall be treated for all
                  purposes as having become the record holder or holders of such
                  shares of the Series B Preferred  Stock at such time and shall
                  have and may exercise  all the rights and powers  appertaining
                  thereto.

                       (ix) For so long as there  are  shares  of Class B Common
                  Stock  outstanding,  this  Series  shall be  convertible  into
                  Series B Preferred Stock in accordance  with Paragraph  (viii)
                  above.  Immediately  upon  the  automatic  conversion  of  all
                  outstanding  shares  of Class B Common  Stock  into  shares of
                  Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Restated Certificate
                  of  Incorporation  of the  Corporation,  as amended,  each one
                  one-thousandth  of a  share  of  this  Series  which  is  then
                  outstanding  shall,   without  any  action  by  the  Board  of
                  Directors of the Corporation or the holder or holders thereof,
                  automatically convert into and become for all purposes a share
                  of the Common Stock,  subject to a sufficient number of shares
                  of Common Stock being authorized and available for issuance to
                  permit such conversion.  To the extent a sufficient  number of
                  shares of Common Stock is not  authorized  and  available  for
                  issuance to permit the  conversion  set forth in the  previous
                  sentence,  then  the one  one-thousandths  of a share  of this
                  Series  shall be  converted  into  Common  Stock on a pro-rata
                  basis to the  extent  possible  given the  number of shares of
                  Common Stock that is  authorized  and  available for issuance.
                  The Board of Directors of the Corporation is hereby authorized
                  to take such  actions,  consistent  with the Delaware  General
                  Corporation Law, as it

                  shall be "Series B Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter
                  called  "THIS  SERIES").  Each share of this  Series  shall be

                  Series  may be issued  in  fractional  shares  which are whole
                  number  multiples  of one  one-thousandth  of a  share,  which

                  payable on or in respect  of Class B Common  Stock  comprising
                  part of the Reference Package (as defined below), in an amount
                  per whole share of this Series equal to the  aggregate  amount
                  of dividends or other  distributions  (other than dividends or
                  distributions   payable  in  Class  B  Common   Stock  of  the
                  Corporation) that would be payable on such date to a holder of
                  the Reference Package and (B) on the last day of March,  June,

                  preceding such dividend or  distribution  payment date,  fixed
                  for the  purpose  by the  Board of  Directors  in  advance  of
                  payment of each particular dividend or distribution. Dividends
                  on each full and each fractional share of this Series shall be
                  cumulative  from the date  such  full or  fractional  share is

                  such event shall  be the Class  B Common  Stock that a  holder
                  of the Reference  Package  immediately prior to such event
                  would hold thereafter as a result thereof.

                  be  entitled  to  any  dividends,  whether  payable  in  cash,
                  property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends,  as
                  herein  provided on this  Series.  This Series shall rank pari
                  passu  in  all  respects  with  the  Series  A   Participating
                  Preferred  Stock of the  Corporation  except  with  respect to
                  voting rights.

                                    So long as any  shares  of this  Series  are
                  outstanding,  no  dividend  (other  than a dividend in Class B
                  Common  Stock or in any  other  stock  ranking  junior to this

                  in each case,  the full  cumulative  dividends  (including the
                  dividend   to  be  due   upon   payment   of  such   dividend,

                  securities,  cash and/or any other property,  then in any such
                  case the  shares  of this  Series  shall  at the same  time be

                  property  (payable in kind), as the case may be, that a holder
                  of the  Reference  Package  would be  entitled to receive as a
                  result of such transaction.

                       (v)  In the  event  of any  liquidation,  dissolution  or
                  winding  up  of  the  affairs  of  the  Corporation,   whether
                  voluntary or  involuntary,  the holders of full and fractional
                  shares  of  this  Series   shall  be   entitled,   before  any
                  distribution  or payment is made on any date to the holders of

                  liquidation,  to be paid in full an amount per whole  share of
                  this Series  equal to the greater of (A)  $__________*/f2/  or

                  together  with  accrued  dividends  to  such  distribution  or
                  payment  date,  whether  or not  earned or  declared.  If such
                  payment  shall have been made in full to all holders of shares
                  of this  Series,  the holders of shares of this Series as such

                  the Corporation.

                  insufficient  to pay in full all amounts to which such holders
                  are entitled  pursuant to the first  paragraph of this Section
                  (v),  no such  distribution  shall be made on  account  of any
                  shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking
                  on  a  parity  with  the  shares  of  this  Series  upon  such
                  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up unless  proportionate
                  distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of
                  this Series,  ratably in proportion to the full  distributable
                  amounts  for  which  holders  of all such  parity  shares  are
                  respectively  entitled upon such  liquidation,  dissolution or
                  winding up.

                  up of the  Corporation,  the  holders of shares of this Series
                  then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of
                  the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders
                  all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the
                  first  paragraph of this Section (v) before any payment  shall
                  be made to the holders of Common Stock or Class B Common Stock
                  or any other  stock of the  Corporation  ranking  junior  upon
                  liquidation to this Series.

                  books shall be open),  and all rights of such  holder  arising
                  from  ownership  of one  one-thousandths  of a  share  of this
                  Series shall cease at such time,  and the person or persons in

                  all purposes as having  become the record holder or holders of
                  such  number  of one  one-thousandths  of a share of  Series A
                  Preferred  Stock at such time and shall have and may  exercise
                  all the rights and powers appertaining thereto. No adjustments
                  in  respect  of past  cash  dividends  shall be made  upon the
                  conversion  of any  one  one-thousandths  of a  share  of this
                  Series; provided,  however, that if any one one-thousandths of
                  a share of this Series  shall be converted  subsequent  to the
                  record  date for the  payment of a cash or stock  dividend  or
                  other  distribution on one  one-thousandths of a share of this
                  Series but prior to such  payment,  the  registered  holder of
                  such one  one-thousandths  of a share at the close of business

                  stock  dividend  or other  distribution  payable to holders of
                  Series A Preferred Stock.  The Corporation  shall at all times
                  reserve  and keep  available,  solely for the purpose of issue

                  of this Series,  such number of one one-thousandths of a share
                  of  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  as may be  issuable  upon the
                  conversion of all such  outstanding one  one-thousandths  of a
                  share of this Series,  provided,  the  Corporation may deliver

                  treasury  of the  Corporation  for shares of this Series to be

                  require  registration  with or  approval  of any  governmental
                  authority under any federal or state law before such shares of
                  the Series A Preferred  Stock may be issued  upon  conversion,
                  the  Corporation  will cause such shares to be duly registered
                  or approved, as the case may be. The Corporation will endeavor
                  to list shares of the Series A Preferred  Stock required to be
                  delivered  upon  conversion  prior to such  delivery  upon any
                  national  securities  exchange  or national  market  system on
                  which the  outstanding  shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
                  may be listed at the time of such delivery.  All shares of the

                  Directors of the Corporation or the holder or holders thereof,
                  automatically  convert  into and become for all  purposes  one
                  share  (subject to  adjustment)  of the Common Stock,  and the
                  provisions of this  Certificate of  Designation  which provide
                  for different  voting or cash dividend  rights for this Series
                  shall not be of any effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if there is not
                  a sufficient  number of shares of Common Stock  authorized and
                  available  for  issuance to permit such  conversion,  each one

                  share  (subject to  adjustment)  of the Common  Stock on a pro

     Hershey     Foods     Corporation     and     its     subsidiaries     (the
&#147;Corporation&#148;)  are engaged in the manufacture,  distribution and sale
of consumer food products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line
of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  was organized  under the laws of the State of Delaware on
October  24,  1927,  as a successor  to a business  founded in 1894 by Milton S.
Hershey.</font></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In December 2000, the Corporation completed the purchase of the intense and
breath freshener mints and gum businesses of Nabisco,  Inc. The Corporation paid
$135.0 million to acquire the  businesses,  including  <I>ICE  BREAKERS</I>  and
<I>BREATH SAVERS COOL BLASTS  </I>intense  mints,  <I>BREATH  SAVERS</I>  mints,
and<I> ICE BREAKERS,  CAREFREE,  STICK*FREE,  BUBBLE YUM</I> and <I>FRUIT STRIPE
</I>gums.  Also  included  in the  purchase  were  manufacturing  machinery  and

     The  Corporation&#146;s  principal  product groups  include:  chocolate and
non-chocolate confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items
and  boxed  items;  and  grocery  products  in the form of  baking  ingredients,
chocolate  drink mixes,  peanut  butter,  dessert  toppings and  beverages.  The
Corporation  believes it is a leader in these product  groups in North  America.
Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands.
Generally,  such margins on chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery  products
are greater than those on grocery products. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     The Corporation&#146;s  products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers,
chain grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores,
vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food
distributors  by full-time  sales  representatives,  food brokers and  part-time
retail sales merchandisers  throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The
Corporation  believes its products are sold in over 2 million  retail outlets in
North America. In 2000, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Subsidiaries amounted
to approximately 17% of the Corporation&#146;s total net sales. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In Japan, the Philippines,  Korea and China, the Corporation imports and/or
markets  selected  confectionery  and grocery  products.  The  Corporation  also
markets  confectionery  and  grocery  products in over 90  countries  worldwide.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation&#146;s  marketing  strategy is based upon the consistently
superior  quality  of its  products,  mass  distribution  and the best  possible
consumer  value in terms of price  and  weight.  In  addition,  the  Corporation
devotes  considerable  resources to the  identification,  development,  testing,
manufacturing and marketing of new products.  The Corporation utilizes a variety
of promotional  programs for customers and advertising and promotional  programs
for consumers.  The Corporation  employs  promotional  programs at various times
during  the  year  to  stimulate  sales  of  certain  products.   Chocolate  and
non-chocolate  confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have
typically  been  highest  during  the third  and  fourth  quarters  of the year.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The Corporation  recognizes that the mass distribution of its consumer food
products is an  important  element in  maintaining  sales  growth and  providing
service to its customers.  The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands
of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable  delivery times
consistent with  achievement of efficiencies in  distribution.  To achieve these
objectives,  the  Corporation  has  developed a  distribution  network  from its
manufacturing  plants,  distribution centers and field warehouses  strategically
located throughout the United States,  Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a
combination  of public and contract  carriers to deliver its  products  from the
distribution  points to its customers.  In conjunction  with sales and marketing
efforts,  the  distribution  system  has  been  instrumental  in  the  effective
promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional
scales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     From time to time,  the  Corporation  has changed the prices and weights of
its products to accommodate  changes in  manufacturing  costs,  the  competitive
environment and profit objectives,  while at the same time maintaining  consumer
value.  The last  standard  candy  bar price  increase  was  implemented  by the
Corporation  in  December  1995,  resulting  in a  wholesale  price  increase of
approximately  11% on its standard and  king-size  candy bars sold in the United
States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  most   significant   raw  material  used  in  the  production  of  the
Corporation&#146;s chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported
principally  from  West  African,  South  American  and Far  Eastern  equatorial
regions.  West Africa accounts for approximately  70% of the world&#146;s  crop.
Cocoa beans are not uniform,  and the various  grades and varieties  reflect the
diverse agricultural  practices and natural conditions found in the many growing
areas.  The  Corporation  buys a mix of cocoa  beans  to meet its  manufacturing
requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The table  below  sets forth  annual  average  cocoa  prices as well as the
highest and lowest monthly  averages for each of the calendar  years  indicated.
The prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active
futures  trading  contracts  closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade.
Because of the Corporation&#146;s  forward purchasing practices discussed below,
and premium  prices paid for certain  varieties  of cocoa beans,  these  average
futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporation&#146;s
average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Federal  Agricultural  and Improvement  Reform Act of 1996,  which is a
seven-year farm bill,  impacts the prices of sugar,  peanuts and milk because it
sets price support levels for these commodities.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>2 </FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=5 noshade>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The price of sugar, the Corporation's  second most important  commodity for
its domestic chocolate and confectionery  products, is subject to price supports
under the above  referenced  farm  legislation.  Due to import quotas and duties
imposed to support the price of sugar  established  by that  legislation,  sugar
prices  paid by United  States  users are  currently  substantially  higher than
prices on the world sugar market.  The average  wholesale  list price of refined
sugar, F.O.B.  Northeast,  has remained in a range of 25&cent;  to 32&cent;  per
pound for the past ten years.  Peanut and almond  prices  remained  near  normal
levels throughout 2000. Milk prices moderated in 2000 as a result of strong milk
production.  The  Corporation  believes  that the  supply  of raw  materials  is
adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  attempts  to  minimize  the effect of price  fluctuations
related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through the forward
purchasing  of such  commodities  to  cover  future  manufacturing  requirements
generally for periods ranging from 3 to 24 months.  With regard to cocoa, sugar,
corn  sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy products,  price risks are also
managed by entering into futures contracts.  At the present time, active futures
contracts are not available for use in pricing the Corporation's other major raw
materials.  Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of
cocoa,   sugar,   corn  sweeteners,   natural  gas  and  certain  dairy  product
requirements  principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide
more favorable pricing opportunities and to increase diversity or flexibility in
sourcing these raw materials.  The Corporation's commodity procurement practices
are  intended  to  reduce  the  risk of  future  price  increases,  but also may
potentially  limit the  Corporation's  ability to benefit  from  possible  price
decreases.</font></p>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The primary effect on liquidity from using futures  contracts is associated
with margin  requirements for futures  contracts  related to cocoa,  sugar, corn
sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy  products.  Cash outflows and inflows
result from original  margins  which are "good faith  deposits"  established  by
futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual
financial obligations.  Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are
required  when the value of open  positions  is adjusted to reflect  daily price
movements.  The  magnitude of such cash  inflows and outflows is dependent  upon
price  coverage  levels and the  volatility of the markets.  Historically,  cash
flows related to margin requirements have not been material to the Corporation's
total working capital requirements.</FONT></P>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  manages the purchase of forward and futures  contracts by
developing  and  monitoring   procurement  strategies  for  each  of  its  major
commodities.  These  procurement  strategies,   including  the  use  of  futures
contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas and
certain  dairy  products,  are  directly  linked  to the  overall  planning  and
management  of the  Corporation's  business,  since  the  cost of raw  materials
accounts for a significant  portion of the cost of finished  goods.  Procurement
strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material requirements
are  developed  by the  analysis  of  fundamentals,  including  weather and crop
analysis,  and  by  discussions  with  market  analysts,  brokers  and  dealers.
Procurement  strategies are  determined,  implemented and monitored on a regular
basis by senior management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are
also reported to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.</FONT></P>

     The   Corporation  has  license   agreements  with  several   companies  to
manufacture  and/or sell  products  worldwide.  Among the more  significant  are
agreements with affiliated  companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture
and/or  market and  distribute  <I>YORK</I>,  <I>PETER  PAUL ALMOND  JOY</I> and
<I>PETER  PAUL   MOUNDS</I>   confectionery   products   worldwide  as  well  as
<I>CADBURY</I> and <I>CARAMELLO</I> confectionery products in the United States.
The  Corporation's  rights under these  agreements are extendible on a long-term
basis  at  the  Corporation's   option.   The  license  for  <I>CADBURY</I>  and
<I>CARAMELLO</I>  products is subject to a minimum sales  requirement  which the
Corporation exceeded in 2000. The Corporation also has an agreement with Societe
des  Produits  Nestle SA, which  licenses the  Corporation  to  manufacture  and

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</B></font>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In January 1999, the Corporation  received a Notice of Proposed  Deficiency
(Notice)  from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  related to the years 1989
through 1996. The Notice  pertained to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI)
program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The IRS disallowed the
interest  expense  deductions  associated  with the  underlying  life  insurance
policies. The total deficiency of $61.2 million, including interest, was paid to
the IRS in  September  2000 to  eliminate  further  accruing  of  interest.  The
Corporation  may be subject to  additional  assessments  for  federal  taxes and
interest  for years  1997 and 1998 and for state  taxes  and  interest  for 1989
through 1998. The  Corporation  believes that it has fully complied with the tax
law as it relates to its COLI program,  has filed for the refund of amounts paid
and will continue to seek favorable  resolution of this matter.  The Corporation
has no other material  pending legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine
litigation incidental to its business.</FONT>

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</B>
<P align="left">
To Hershey Foods Corporation:
<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     We have audited,  in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted
in the United States, the consolidated  financial statements included in Hershey
Foods  Corporation's Proxy Statement for its 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
incorporated  by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon
dated January 26, 2001. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion
on those financial  statements  taken as a whole. The schedule listed on page 15
in Item 14(a)(2) is the  responsibility of the  Corporation's  management and is
presented  for  purposes  of  complying   with  the   Securities   and  Exchange
Commission's  rules  and is not part of the  basic  financial  statements.  This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing  procedures  applied in the audit of
the  basic  financial  statements  and,  in our  opinion,  fairly  states in all
material  respects  the  financial  data  required  to be set forth  therein  in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
