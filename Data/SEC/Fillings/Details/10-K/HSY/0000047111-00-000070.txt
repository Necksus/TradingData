                                     PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

     Hershey Foods  Corporation and its  subsidiaries  (the  "Corporation")  are
engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of consumer food products. The
Corporation produces and distributes a broad line of chocolate and non-chocolate
confectionery and grocery products.

     The  Corporation  was organized  under the laws of the State of Delaware on
October  24,  1927,  as a successor  to a business  founded in 1894 by Milton S.
Hershey.

     In January  1999,  the  Corporation  completed  the sale of its U.S.  pasta
business to New World Pasta, LLC. The transaction  included the AMERICAN BEAUTY,
IDEAL BY SAN GIORGIO, LIGHT `N FLUFFY, MRS. WEISS, P&R, RONZONI, SAN GIORGIO and
SKINNER  pasta  brands  along with six  manufacturing  plants.  The  Corporation
retained a 6% minority interest in the business.

     The  Corporation's   principal   product  groups  include:   chocolate  and
non-chocolate confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items
and  boxed  items;  and  grocery  products  in the form of  baking  ingredients,
chocolate  drink mixes,  peanut  butter,  dessert  toppings and  beverages.  The
Corporation  believes it is a leader in these product  groups in North  America.
Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands.
Generally,  such margins on chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery  products
are greater than those on grocery products.

     In North America, the Corporation  manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate
confectionery  products  in a variety of packaged  forms and markets  them under
more than 50 brands. The different  packaged forms include various  arrangements
of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as a variety of
different  sizes  and  weights  of the same bar  products,  such as snack  size,
standard,  king size,  large and giant bars.  Among the principal  chocolate and
non-chocolate  confectionery  products in the United States are: HERSHEY'S BITES
candies, HERSHEY'S classic caramels, HERSHEY'S COOKIES 'N' CREME chocolate bars,
HERSHEY'S HUGS chocolates,  HERSHEY'S KISSES  chocolates,  HERSHEY'S KISSES WITH
ALMONDS chocolates, HERSHEY'S milk chocolate bars, HERSHEY'S milk chocolate bars
with almonds, HERSHEY'S MINIATURES chocolate bars, HERSHEY'S NUGGETS chocolates,
AMAZIN'  FRUIT gummy  bears fruit  candy,  CARAMELLO  candy bars,  GOOD & PLENTY
candy, HEATH toffee bar, JOLLY RANCHER candy, KIT KAT wafer bars, LUDEN'S throat
drops,  MILK DUDS chocolate  covered  caramels,  MR. GOODBAR milk chocolate bars
with peanuts, NIBS candy, PAYDAY peanut caramel bar, PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY candy
bars, PETER PAUL MOUNDS candy bars, POT OF GOLD boxed  chocolates,  RAIN-BLO and
SUPER BUBBLE gum,  REESE'S  NUTRAGEOUS  candy bars,  REESE'S peanut butter cups,
REESE'S PIECES candies, REESESTICKS wafer bars, ROLO caramels in milk chocolate,
SIXLETS candies,  SKOR toffee bars,  SYMPHONY milk chocolate bars, SWEET ESCAPES
candy bars,  TASTETATIONS candy,  TWIZZLERS candy,  WHATCHAMACALLIT  candy bars,
WHOPPERS malted milk balls,  YORK peppermint pattie candy, 5TH AVENUE candy bars
and ZERO candy bars.  Principal  products in Canada  include  CHIPITS  chocolate
chips, GLOSETTE  chocolate-covered raisins, peanuts and almonds, OH HENRY! candy
bars,  POT OF GOLD  boxed  chocolates,  REESE  PEANUT  BUTTER  CUPS  candy,  and
TWIZZLERS candy. The Corporation also manufactures,  imports, markets, sells and
distributes chocolate products in Mexico under the HERSHEY'S brand name.

     The Corporation  manufactures and markets a line of grocery products in the
baking, beverage,  peanut butter and toppings categories.  Principal products in
the United States include HERSHEY'S,  REESE'S and HEATH baking pieces, HERSHEY'S
drink boxes,  HERSHEY'S chocolate milk mix, HERSHEY'S cocoa, HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE
SHOPPE  ice cream  toppings,  HERSHEY'S  HOT  COCOA  COLLECTION  hot cocoa  mix,
HERSHEY'S syrup and REESE'S peanut butter.  HERSHEY'S chocolate milk is produced
and sold under  license by certain  independent  dairies  throughout  the United
States,  using a chocolate milk mix manufactured by the Corporation.  Baking and
various  other  products are produced and sold under the  HERSHEY'S  and REESE'S
brand names by third parties who have been granted  licenses by the  Corporation
to use these trademarks.


                                       1
<PAGE>

     The Corporation's products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain
grocery  stores,  candy  distributors,  mass  merchandisers,  chain drug stores,
vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food
distributors  by full-time  sales  representatives,  food brokers and  part-time
retail sales merchandisers  throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The
Corporation  believes its products are sold in over 2 million  retail outlets in
North America. In 1999, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Subsidiaries amounted
to approximately 15% of the Corporation's total net sales.

     In Japan, the Philippines,  Korea and China, the Corporation imports and/or
markets  selected  confectionery  and grocery  products.  The  Corporation  also
markets chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery products in over 90 countries
worldwide.

     The  Corporation's  marketing  strategy  is  based  upon  the  consistently
superior  quality  of its  products,  mass  distribution  and the best  possible
consumer  value in terms of price  and  weight.  In  addition,  the  Corporation
devotes  considerable  resources to the  identification,  development,  testing,
manufacturing and marketing of new products.  The Corporation utilizes a variety
of promotional  programs for customers and advertising and promotional  programs
for consumers.  The Corporation  employs  promotional  programs at various times
during  the  year  to  stimulate  sales  of  certain  products.   Chocolate  and
non-chocolate  confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have
typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year.

     The Corporation  recognizes that the mass distribution of its consumer food
products is an  important  element in  maintaining  sales  growth and  providing
service to its customers.  The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands
of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable  delivery times
consistent with  achievement of efficiencies in  distribution.  To achieve these
objectives,  the  Corporation  has  developed a  distribution  network  from its
manufacturing  plants,  distribution centers and field warehouses  strategically
located throughout the United States,  Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a
combination  of public and contract  carriers to deliver its  products  from the
distribution  points to its customers.  In conjunction  with sales and marketing
efforts,  the  distribution  system  has  been  instrumental  in  the  effective
promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional
scales.

     Problems  with the  start-up of new business  systems and  processes in the
areas of customer  service,  warehousing and order  fulfillment were encountered
during the  Corporation's  peak  shipping  season in the third  quarter of 1999.
These problems resulted in lost sales,  longer  turnaround times,  significantly
increased  freight and  warehousing  costs,  and higher levels of inventories in
1999.  Additionally,  as a result of these problems,  accounts  receivable as of
December 31, 1999,  included  increased  deductions  from customer  invoices and
higher  past due amounts as  compared  to the prior  year.  Improvements  to the
systems and processes led to a significantly improved order fulfillment process,
with  reduced  order  cycle time and much  improved  fill rates on orders in the
first  quarter of 2000.  While  customer  service has not yet fully  returned to
historical levels, the Corporation  expects that it will continue to be enhanced
with further improvement of the systems and processes and, as the first phase of
a new 1.2 million  square-foot  distribution  center becomes  operational in the
spring of 2000,  with full  utilization  expected  during the fall 2000 shipping
season.

     From time to time,  the  Corporation  has changed the prices and weights of
its products to accommodate  changes in  manufacturing  costs,  the  competitive
environment and profit objectives,  while at the same time maintaining  consumer
value.  The last  standard  candy  bar price  increase  was  implemented  by the
Corporation  in  December  1995,  resulting  in a  wholesale  price  increase of
approximately  11% on its standard and  king-size  candy bars sold in the United
States.

     The  most   significant   raw  material  used  in  the  production  of  the
Corporation's  chocolate  products is cocoa  beans.  This  commodity is imported
principally  from  West  African,  South  American  and Far  Eastern  equatorial
regions.  West Africa accounts for  approximately 70% of the world's crop. Cocoa
beans are not uniform,  and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse
agricultural  practices and natural  conditions found in the many growing areas.
The  Corporation   buys  a  mix  of  cocoa  beans  to  meet  its   manufacturing
requirements.

     The table  below  sets forth  annual  average  cocoa  prices as well as the
highest and lowest monthly  averages for each of the calendar  years  indicated.
The prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active
futures  trading  contracts  closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade.
Because of the Corporation's  forward purchasing  practices discussed below, and
premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans,  these average futures
contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporation's average cost
of cocoa beans or cocoa products.

          Statistics

     The Federal  Agricultural  and Improvement  Reform Act of 1996,  which is a
seven-year farm bill,  impacts the prices of sugar,  peanuts and milk because it
sets price support levels for these commodities.

     The price of sugar, the Corporation's  second most important  commodity for
its domestic chocolate and confectionery  products, is subject to price supports
under the above  referenced  farm  legislation.  Due to import quotas and duties
imposed to support the price of sugar  established  by that  legislation,  sugar
prices  paid by United  States  users are  currently  substantially  higher than
prices on the world sugar market.  The average  wholesale  list price of refined
sugar, F.O.B.  Northeast,  has remained relatively stable in a range of $.27
to $.35 per pound for the past ten years.

     Peanut prices  remained near normal levels  throughout  1999,  while almond
prices declined to relatively low levels due to a record crop in California.

     Milk  prices  were  extremely  volatile  in  1999;  however,   strong  milk
production  resulted in the average  milk price  dropping to a more normal level
from the historic high prices of 1998.

     The  Corporation  attempts  to  minimize  the effect of price  fluctuations
related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through the forward
purchasing  of such  commodities  to  cover  future  manufacturing  requirements
generally for periods ranging from 3 to 24 months.  With regard to cocoa, sugar,
corn  sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy products,  price risks are also
managed by entering into futures contracts.  At the present time, active futures
contracts are not available for use in pricing the Corporation's other major raw
materials.  Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of
cocoa,   sugar,   corn  sweeteners,   natural  gas  and  certain  dairy  product
requirements  principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide
more favorable pricing opportunities and to increase diversity or flexibility in
sourcing these raw materials.  The Corporation's commodity procurement practices
are  intended  to  reduce  the  risk of  future  price  increases,  but also may
potentially  limit the  Corporation's  ability to benefit  from  possible  price
decreases.

     The primary effect on liquidity from using futures  contracts is associated
with margin  requirements for futures  contracts  related to cocoa,  sugar, corn
sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy  products.  Cash outflows and inflows
result from original  margins  which are "good faith  deposits"  established  by
futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual
financial obligations.  Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are
required  when the value of open  positions  is adjusted to reflect  daily price
movements.  The  magnitude of such cash  inflows and outflows is dependent  upon
price  coverage  levels and the  volatility of the markets.  Historically,  cash
flows related to margin requirements have not been material to the Corporation's
total working capital requirements.

     The  Corporation  manages the purchase of forward and futures  contracts by
developing  and  monitoring   procurement  strategies  for  each  of  its  major
commodities.  These  procurement  strategies,   including  the  use  of  futures
contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas and
certain  dairy  products,  are  directly  linked  to the  overall  planning  and
management  of the  Corporation's  business,  since  the  cost of raw  materials
accounts for a significant  portion of the cost of finished  goods.  Procurement
strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material requirements
are  developed  by the  analysis  of  fundamentals,  including  weather and crop
analysis,  and  by  discussions  with  market  analysts,  brokers  and  dealers.
Procurement  strategies are  determined,  implemented and monitored on a regular
basis by senior management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are
also reported to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.

     The   Corporation  has  license   agreements  with  several   companies  to
manufacture  and/or sell  products  worldwide.  Among the more  significant  are
agreements with affiliated  companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture
and/or market and distribute  YORK,  PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY and PETER PAUL MOUNDS
confectionery products worldwide as well as CADBURY and CARAMELLO  confectionery
products in the United States.  The Corporation's  rights under these agreements
are

                                       3
<PAGE>

extendible on a long-term  basis at the  Corporation's  option.  The license for
CADBURY and CARAMELLO  products is subject to a minimum sales  requirement which
the  Corporation  exceeded in 1999. The  Corporation  also has an agreement with
Societe des Produits  Nestle SA, which  licenses the  Corporation to manufacture
and distribute KIT KAT and ROLO confectionery products in the United States. The
Corporation's rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term basis at
the Corporation's option, subject to certain conditions,  including minimum unit
volume sales.  In 1999,  the minimum  volume  requirements  were  exceeded.  The
Corporation  has an agreement  with an  affiliate  of  Huhtamaki Oy  (Huhtamaki)
pursuant to which it licenses the use of certain  trademarks,  including  GOOD &
PLENTY,  HEATH,  JOLLY  RANCHER,  MILK DUDS,  PAYDAY and WHOPPERS  confectionery
products worldwide. The Corporation's rights under this agreement are extendible
on a long-term basis at the Corporation's option.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES

     The Corporation completed its year 2000 testing and remediation programs in
the  third  quarter  of 1999.  No  significant  year  2000  problems  have  been
encountered  with the  Corporation's  information  technology  (IT)  and  non-IT
systems.

     The Corporation also assessed year 2000 remediation  issues relating to its
major business  partners.  All of the  Corporation's  major  customers have been
contacted regarding year 2000 issues related to electronic data interchange. The
Corporation also contacted all of its major suppliers of ingredients, packaging,
facilities, logistics and financial services with regard to year 2000 issues. No
significant  year 2000 problems  have been  encountered  with the  Corporation's
major business partners.

COMPETITION

     Many of the  Corporation's  brands enjoy wide consumer  acceptance  and are
among the leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold
in  highly  competitive  markets  and  compete  with many  other  multinational,
national,  regional and local firms,  some of which have  resources in excess of
those available to the Corporation.

TRADEMARKS

     The Corporation  owns various  registered and  unregistered  trademarks and
service marks, and has rights under licenses to use various trademarks which are
of material importance to the Corporation's business.

BACKLOG OF ORDERS

     The Corporation  manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders
from finished goods inventories. Customer service and order fulfillment problems
associated  with  the  start-up  of new  business  systems  and  processes  were
encountered  during  the  important  Back-to-School/Halloween  shipping  period,
causing  distribution  difficulties  in the form of  incomplete  and/or  delayed
shipments  and  selective  regional/customer  out of  stock  conditions  for the
Corporation's  products  in  certain  markets.  While the  backlog of orders was
significant  during the third quarter of 1999,  such backlog was not material in
respect to total sales as of December 31, 1999.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     The  Corporation  engages  in  a  variety  of  research  activities.  These
principally involve  development of new products,  improvement in the quality of
existing products,  improvement and modernization of production  processes,  and
the development and  implementation  of new  technologies to enhance the quality
and value of both current and proposed product lines.

REGULATION

     The Corporation's domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and
Drug  Administration and various other governmental  agencies,  and its products
must comply with  regulations  under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
with  various  comparable  state  statutes   regulating  the  manufacturing  and
marketing of food products.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In January 1999, the Corporation  received a Notice of Proposed  Deficiency
from the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) related to the years 1989 through 1996.
The most significant issue pertains to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI)
program which was  implemented  by the  Corporation in 1989. The IRS proposed an
assessment for the disallowance of interest expense  deductions  associated with
the underlying life insurance policies. The total impact of the disallowance was
approximately  $60.4  million,  including  interest as of December 31, 1999. The
Corporation  may be subject to additional  assessments for federal and state tax
and interest  payments for years  subsequent to 1996. The  Corporation  believes
that it has fully  complied  with the tax law as it relates to its COLI  program
The  Corporation  filed a protest of the  proposed  deficiency  with the Appeals
section of the IRS in April 1999 and continues to vigorously defend its position
on this matter. The Corporation has no other material pending legal proceedings,
other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Hershey Foods Corporation:

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing  standards,  the
consolidated  financial statements included in Hershey Foods Corporation's Proxy
Statement for its 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders  incorporated by reference
in this Form 10-K,  and have issued our report  thereon  dated January 28, 2000.
Our audit was made for the  purpose of  forming  an  opinion on those  financial
statements  taken as a whole.  The schedule listed on page 9 in Item 14(a)(2) is
the responsibility of the Corporation's management and is presented for purposes
of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part
of the basic  financial  statements.  This  schedule  has been  subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial  statements and,
in our opinion,  fairly  states in all  material  respects  the  financial  data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements
taken as a whole.

Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall be made on notice,  given not later than (i)
11:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the third  Business Day prior to the date of
the  proposed  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  in the case of a  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing  consisting of  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or (ii) 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the day of the proposed  Revolving Credit Borrowing in the case of
a Revolving Credit Borrowing  consisting of Base Rate Advances,  by any Borrower
to the  Agent,  which  shall  give to  each  Lender  prompt  notice  thereof  by
telecopier or telex. Each such notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing (a "NOTICE

such  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,  make  available  for  the  account  of  its
Applicable  Lending  Office to the  Agent at the  Agent's  Account,  in same day
funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit  Borrowing.  After
the  Agent's  receipt  of such  funds  and upon  fulfillment  of the  applicable
conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to


                                       13
<PAGE>

the Borrower  requesting the Revolving  Credit  Borrowing at the Agent's address
referred to in Section 9.02.

                  (b)  Anything  herein  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,   a
Borrower  may not select  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  for any  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing if the  obligation  of the Lenders to make  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances
shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12.

                  (c) Each Notice of Revolving  Credit Borrowing of any Borrower
shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower.  In the case of any Revolving
Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies
is to be comprised of Eurodollar  Rate Advances,  the Borrower  requesting  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall  indemnify  each Lender,  after receipt of a
written request by such Lender setting forth in reasonable  detail the basis for
such request, against any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by such Lender
as a result of any  failure  by such  Borrower  to fulfill on or before the date
specified in such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing for such Revolving Credit
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without
limitation,  any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits),  cost or expense
actually  incurred by reason of the  liquidation or  reemployment of deposits or
other funds  acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving  Credit Advance to be
made  by such  Lender  as part of such  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  when  such
Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

                  (d) Unless the Agent shall have received  notice from a Lender
prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate
Advances  or prior to the time of the  proposed  disbursement  of any  Revolving
Credit Borrowing  comprised of Base Rate Advances that such Lender will not make
available to the Agent such Lender's  ratable  portion of such Revolving  Credit
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Agent on the date of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in accordance with
subsection  (a) of this  Section  2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance  upon such
assumption,  make available to the Borrower  requesting  such  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing on such date a  corresponding  amount.  If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion  available to the Agent, such
Lender and such  Borrower  severally  agree to repay to the Agent  forthwith  on
demand such  corresponding  amount together with interest thereon,  for each day
from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest
rate  applicable  at the  time to  Revolving  Credit  Advances  comprising  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of such  Lender,  the Federal
Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such  corresponding  amount,
such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as
part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (e) The  failure  of any Lender to make the  Revolving  Credit
Advance to be made by it as part of any  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall not
relieve  any  other  Lender of its  obligation,  if any,  hereunder  to make its
Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing,  but no
Lender  shall be  responsible  for the  failure of any other  Lender to make the
Revolving  Credit  Advance  to be made by such  other  Lender on the date of any
Revolving Credit Borrowing.

         (the Advances  comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing being referred
         to herein as "LIBO RATE  ADVANCES").  Each  Notice of  Competitive  Bid
         Borrowing  of a  Borrower  shall be  irrevocable  and  binding  on such
         Borrower.  Any Notice of  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  by a  Designated
         Subsidiary shall be given to the Agent in accordance with the preceding
         sentence  through the Company on behalf of such Designated  Subsidiary.

         any Competitive Bid Advance as part of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing;
         PROVIDED  that the failure by any Lender to give such notice  shall not
         cause such Lender to be obligated to make any  Competitive  Bid Advance
         as part of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                  (iii) The Borrower  proposing  the  Competitive  Bid Borrowing
         shall,  in turn,  before 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of
         such proposed  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive
         Bid  Borrowing  consisting of Fixed Rate Advances and before 11:00 A.M.
         (New  York City  time)  three  Business  Days  before  the date of such
         proposed  Competitive  Bid Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive Bid
         Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances, either:

                           (x)      cancel such Competitive Bid Borrowing by
                  giving the Agent notice to that effect, or

                           (y)  accept  one or  more of the  offers  made by any
                  Lender or Lenders  pursuant to  paragraph  (ii) above,  in its
                  sole  discretion,  by giving notice to the Agent of the amount
                  of each  Competitive  Bid Advance (which amount shall be equal
                  to or greater  than the minimum  amount,  and equal to or less
                  than the  maximum  amount,  notified  to such  Borrower by the
                  Agent  on  behalf  of such  Lender  for such  Competitive  Bid
                  Advance  pursuant to paragraph  (ii) above) to be made by each
                  Lender as part of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  and reject
                  any  remaining  offers made by Lenders  pursuant to  paragraph
                  (ii)  above  by  giving  the  Agent  notice  to  that  effect;
                  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that such  Borrower  shall not accept any
                  offer in excess of the  requested bid amount for any maturity.
                  Such  Borrower  shall  accept the offers made by any Lender or
                  Lenders  to make  Competitive  Bid  Advances  in  order of the

                                       16
<PAGE>


                  lowest  to the  highest  rates  of  interest  offered  by such
                  Lenders. If two or more Lenders have offered the same interest
                  rate,  the amount to be borrowed at such interest rate will be
                  allocated  among such Lenders in proportion to the amount that
                  each such Lender offered at such interest rate.

                  (iv) If the Borrower  proposing  the  Competitive  Bid Advance
         notifies  the Agent that such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing is cancelled
         pursuant  to  paragraph  (iii)(x)  above,  the Agent  shall give prompt
         notice thereof to the Lenders and such  Competitive Bid Borrowing shall
         not be made.

                  (v) If the  Borrower  proposing  the  Competitive  Bid Advance
         accepts  one or  more  of the  offers  made by any  Lender  or  Lenders
         pursuant to paragraph  (iii)(y) above, the Agent shall in turn promptly
         notify (A) each Lender that has made an offer as described in paragraph
         (ii) above,  of the date and aggregate  amount of such  Competitive Bid
         Borrowing  and  whether or not any offer or offers  made by such Lender
         pursuant to paragraph  (ii) above have been accepted by such  Borrower,
         (B) each  Lender that is to make a  Competitive  Bid Advance as part of
         such  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  of the amount of each Competitive Bid
         Advance  to be made  by such  Lender  as part of such  Competitive  Bid
         Borrowing,  and (C)  each  Lender  that is to  make a  Competitive  Bid
         Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing,  upon receipt,  that
         the Agent has  received  forms of  documents  appearing  to fulfill the
         applicable  conditions set forth in Article III. Each Lender that is to
         make a  Competitive  Bid  Advance  as  part  of  such  Competitive  Bid
         Borrowing shall,  before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of
         such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing  specified in the notice received from
         the Agent pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding sentence or any later
         time  when  such  Lender  shall  have  received  notice  from the Agent
         pursuant to clause (C) of the preceding  sentence,  make  available for
         the  account  of its  Applicable  Lending  Office  to the  Agent at the
         Agent's  Account,  in same day  funds,  such  Lender's  portion of such
         Competitive   Bid  Borrowing.   Upon   fulfillment  of  the  applicable
         conditions  set forth in Article III and after  receipt by the Agent of
         such funds,  the Agent will make such funds  available to such Borrower
         at the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.02. Promptly after each
         Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  the Agent will  notify  each Lender of the
         amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing, the consequent Competitive Bid
         Reduction  and the dates  upon  which such  Competitive  Bid  Reduction
         commenced and will terminate.

                  (vi) If the Borrower  proposing  the  Competitive  Bid Advance
         notifies  the Agent that it accepts  one or more of the offers  made by
         any Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above, such notice
         of acceptance  shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower.  Such
         Borrower  shall  indemnify  each  Lender,  after  receipt  of a written
         request by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
         such request,  against any loss, cost or expense  actually  incurred by
         such Lender as a result of any  failure by such  Borrower to fulfill on
         or before the date specified in the related  Notice of Competitive  Bid
         Borrowing for such Competitive Bid Borrowing the applicable  conditions
         set forth in  Article  III,  including,  without  limitation,  any loss
         (other  than loss of  anticipated  profits),  cost or expense  actually

                                       17

         incurred by reason of the  liquidation or  reemployment  of deposits or
         other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Competitive Bid Advance
         to be made by such  Lender as part of such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing
         when such Competitive Bid Advance,  as a result of such failure, is not
         made on such date.

<PAGE>

                  (b) Each  Competitive  Bid Borrowing  shall be in an aggregate
amount of  $10,000,000  or an integral  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof
and,  following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing,  the Borrower that
has borrowed  through such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in compliance with
the  limitation set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of subsection (a)
above.

                  (c) Within the limits and on the  conditions set forth in this
Section  2.03,  each  Borrower  may from time to time borrow  under this Section
2.03,  repay or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this
Section 2.03.

                  (d) Each Borrower that has borrowed  through a Competitive Bid
Borrowing  shall repay to the Agent for the account of each Lender that has made
a Competitive Bid Advance,  on the maturity date of such Competitive Bid Advance
(such  maturity date being that specified by such Borrower for repayment of such
Competitive  Bid  Advance in the related  Notice of  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing
delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(i) above and provided in the  Competitive
Bid Note evidencing such  Competitive  Bid Advance),  the then unpaid  principal
amount of such Competitive Bid Advance. A Borrower shall have no right to prepay
any principal  amount of any  Competitive Bid Advance without the consent of the
Lender  that has made such  Competitive  Bid Advance or as is  specified  in the
Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                  (e) Each Borrower that has borrowed  through a Competitive Bid
Borrowing shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal amount of each Competitive
Bid  Advance  from the date of such  Competitive  Bid  Advance  comprising  such
Competitive Bid Borrowing to the date the principal  amount of such  Competitive
Bid Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such  Competitive Bid
Advance  specified  by the Lender  making  such  Competitive  Bid Advance in its
notice with respect  thereto  delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(ii)  above,
payable on the  interest  payment date or dates  specified by such  Borrower for
such  Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing
delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(i) above,  as provided in the Competitive
Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), each Borrower that
has borrowed though a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall pay interest on the amount
of unpaid principal of and interest on each  Competitive Bid Advance  comprising
such Competitive Bid Borrowing that is owing to a Lender,  payable in arrears on
the date or dates interest is payable thereon,  at a rate per annum equal at all
times to 2% per  annum  above  the rate per  annum  required  to be paid on such
Competitive  Bid Advance under the terms of the  Competitive Bid Note evidencing
such  Competitive Bid Advance unless  otherwise  agreed in such  Competitive Bid
Note.

                  (f) The  indebtedness  of any  Borrower  resulting  from  each
Competitive  Bid  Advance  made to such  Borrower as part of a  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing shall be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of such Borrower
payable to the order of the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.


                  SECTION 2.04.  FEES.  (a)  FACILITY FEE.  The Company agrees
to pay to the Agent for the  account of each  Lender a facility  fee (i) on
the  aggregate  amount of such Lender's  Commitment  from the date hereof in the
case of each  Initial  Lender  and  from the  effective  date  specified  in the
Assumption  Agreement  or the  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  as the case may be,

Credit  Advances  payable to such  Lender from the  Termination  Date until such

equal to .055%,  payable in arrears  quarterly on the last day of each February,

 its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed in writing between
 the Company and the Agent.

                  SECTION  2.05.  TERMINATION,  REDUCTION  OR  INCREASE  OF  THE
COMMITMENTS.  (a) TERMINATION OR RATABLE  REDUCTION BY THE COMPANY.  The Company
shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to
terminate  in  whole  or  reduce  ratably  in part the  unused  portions  of the
respective  Commitments  of the Lenders,  PROVIDED  that each partial  reduction
shall be in the  aggregate  amount of  $10,000,000  or an  integral  multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and PROVIDED  FURTHER that the aggregate  amount of
the  Commitments  of the Lenders  shall not be reduced to an amount that is less

outstanding. The aggregate amount of the Commitments, once reduced or terminated
as provided in this Section 2.05(a),  may not be reinstated,  except as provided
in Section 2.05(c) below.

                  (b)  TERMINATION  BY  THE  MAJORITY  LENDERS  UPON  CHANGE  OF
CONTROL.  In the event that a Change of Control  occurs,  (i) the Agent shall at
the request,  or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the
Company  given not later than 10 Business  Days after receipt by the Lenders and
the Agent of notice  from the  Company  of such  Change of Control  pursuant  to
Section 5.01(h)(iv),  declare the Commitments  (determined without giving effect
to any Competitive Bid Reduction) to be terminated in whole, effective as of the
date set forth in such  notice,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that such date shall be no
earlier  than 10  Business  Days after the  Company's  receipt of such notice of
termination  and (ii)  each  Borrower's  right to make a  Borrowing  under  this
Agreement  shall  thereupon be suspended  and shall  remain  suspended  until 10
Business  Days after  receipt by the  Lenders  and the Agent of notice  from the
Company of such  Change of Control  pursuant to Section  5.01(h)(iv)  unless the
Majority  Lenders shall have exercised  their right to terminate the Commitments
as provided in clause (i) of this Section 2.05(b), in which case each Borrower's
right to make a Borrowing under this Agreement shall remain  suspended until the
effective date of such  termination.  A notice of  termination  pursuant to this

                                       19
<PAGE>

Section 2.05(b) shall have the effect of accelerating  the outstanding  Advances
of the Lenders and the Notes of the Lenders and each Borrower shall, on or prior
to the effective date of the termination of the Commitments,  prepay or cause to
be prepaid the  outstanding  principal  amount of all Advances owing by any such
Borrower to the Lenders,  together with accrued  interest thereon to the date of

Section 2.14).  Upon such  prepayment and the  termination of the Commitments in
accordance with this Section 2.05(b),  the obligations of the Lenders under this
Agreement shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged.

                  (c) INCREASE BY THE COMPANY.  (i) The Company may at any time,
by notice to the Agent,  propose that the aggregate amount of the Commitments be
increased (each such proposed  increase being a "COMMITMENT  INCREASE") by up to
$250,000,000  in excess of the aggregate of the  Commitments as of the Effective
Date,  effective  as at a date (the  "COMMITMENT  INCREASE  DATE") that shall be
specified in such notice and that shall be (A) prior to the Termination Date and
(B) at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that (w) the Company may not propose more than two Commitment  Increases  during
any  calendar  year,  (x) the  minimum  proposed  Commitment  Increase  for each
Commitment  Increase  Date  shall  be  $50,000,000,  (y) in no event  shall  the
aggregate  amount of the Commitments at any time exceed  $450,000,000 and (z) no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such  Commitment  Increase Date
or shall  result  from such  Commitment  Increase.  The Agent  shall  notify the
Lenders and any Eligible  Assignees  requested by the Company and  acceptable to
the Agent as potential  Assuming  Lenders  hereunder of the proposed  Commitment
Increase  promptly upon the Agent's  receipt of any such notice.  It shall be in
each Lender's sole  discretion  whether to increase its Commitment  hereunder in
connection with the proposed Commitment Increase. No later than 10 Business Days
after its  receipt  of the  Company's  notice,  each  Lender  that is willing to
increase  its  Commitment  hereunder  (each  such  Lender  being an  "INCREASING
LENDER")  shall  deliver  to the Agent a notice in which such  Lender  shall set
forth the maximum  increase in its Commitment to which such Lender is willing to
agree,  and the  Agent  shall  promptly  provide  to the  Company a copy of such
Increasing  Lender's  notice.  The Agent  shall  cooperate  with the  Company in
discussions with the Lenders and Eligible Assignees with a view to arranging the
proposed  Commitment  Increase through the increase of the Commitments of one or
more of the  Lenders  and/or  the  addition  of one or more  Eligible  Assignees
acceptable  to the Company  and the Agent as Assuming  Lenders and as parties to
this  Agreement;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVEr,  that the minimum  Commitment of each such
Assuming Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement  pursuant to this Section
2.05(c) shall be  $10,000,000;  and PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  that any allocations of
Commitments shall be determined by the Company.

                  (ii) If agreement is reached prior to the relevant  Commitment
Increase  Date  with  any  Increasing  Lenders  and  Assuming  Lenders  as  to a
Commitment  Increase  (the  amount  of which may be less  than  (subject  to the
limitation  set forth in clause (i)(x) of this Section  2.05(c)) but not greater
than that amount  specified  in the  applicable  notice from the  Company),  the
Company shall  deliver,  no later than one Business Day prior to the  Commitment
Increase Date, a notice thereof in reasonable detail to the Agent (and the Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Lenders,  including any Assuming Lenders).  The

                                       20

Assuming  Lenders,  if any, shall become Lenders  hereunder as of the Commitment
Increase Date and the  Commitments of any  Increasing  Lenders and such Assuming
Lenders  shall become or be, as the case may be, as of the  Commitment  Increase
Date, the amounts specified in the notice delivered by the Company to the Agent;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that:

         effect  to  such  Commitment  Increase,  (B) a  certificate  of a  duly
         authorized  officer of the Company  stating  that no event has occurred
         and is continuing,  or would result from such Commitment Increase, that
         constitutes a Default, and that each of the other applicable conditions
         to such  Commitment  Increase set forth in this  Section  2.05(c) to be
         fulfilled  by the  Company  has been  satisfied  and (C) an  opinion of
         counsel  for the  Company  in  substantially  the form of  Exhibit  H-1
         hereto,  dated the  Commitment  Increase  Date  (with  copies  for each
         Lender, including each Assuming Lender);

                  (y) with respect to each Assuming Lender, the Agent shall have

         Assuming Lender and the Company, and acknowledged by the Agent; and

                  (z) each Increasing  Lender shall have delivered to the Agent,

         confirmation  in writing  satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased
         Commitment, with a copy of such confirmation to the Company.

                  (iii) Upon its receipt of  confirmation  from a Lender that it
is increasing its Commitment hereunder,  together with the appropriate Revolving
Credit  Note or Notes,  certificate  and opinion  referred to in clause  (ii)(x)
above,  the Agent  shall (A) record  the  information  contained  therein in the
Register and (B) give prompt notice thereof to the Company.  Upon its receipt of
an Assumption  Agreement executed by an Assuming Lender  representing that it is
an Eligible  Assignee,  together with the appropriate  Revolving  Credit Note or
Notes,  certificate and opinion  referred to in clause (ii)(x) above,  the Agent
shall, if such Assumption  Agreement has been completed and is in  substantially

                  (iv) In the  event  that the  Agent  shall  not have  received
notice  from the  Company  as to such  agreement  on or prior to the  Commitment
Increase  Date or the  Company  shall,  by  notice  to the  Agent  prior  to the
Commitment Increase Date, withdraw its proposal for a Commitment Increase or any
of the actions  provided for above in clauses  (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) shall not
have occurred by 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment Increase Date,
such  proposal  by the  Company  shall be deemed not to have been made.  In such
event, any actions theretofore taken under clauses (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) above
shall be deemed to be of no effect  and all the rights  and  obligations  of the
parties shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.

                  (v) In the event  that the Agent  shall have  received  notice
from the Company as to such  agreement  on or prior to the  Commitment  Increase
Date and each of the actions  provided for in clauses  (ii)(x)  through  (ii)(z)
above shall have  occurred by 9:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the  Commitment
Increase  Date,  the Agent shall  notify the  Lenders  (including  any  Assuming
Lenders) of the occurrence of the  Commitment  Increase Date promptly and in any
event by 10:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on such date by  telecopier,  telex or
cable. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall,  before 11:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on the  Commitment  Increase  Date,  make available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in
same day funds,  in the case of such  Assuming  Lender,  an amount equal to such
Assuming  Lender's  ratable  portion of the  Revolving  Credit  Borrowings  then
outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase)
and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (i)
such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then
outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase)
over (ii) such  Increasing  Lender's  ratable  portion of the  Revolving  Credit
Borrowings then outstanding  (calculated based on its Commitment (without giving
effect to the relevant  Commitment  Increase) as a percentage  of the  aggregate
Commitments  without giving effect to the relevant Commitment  Increase).  After
the Agent's receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such
Assuming Lender, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like
funds to the  other  Lenders  for the  account  of their  respective  Applicable
Lending Offices in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount
of the outstanding  Revolving  Credit Advances owing to each Lender after giving
effect  to  such  distribution  equals  such  Lender's  ratable  portion  of the
Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding  (calculated based on such Lender's
Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving
effect to the relevant  Commitment  Increase).  If the Commitment  Increase Date
shall  occur on a date that is not the last day of the  Interest  Period for all
Eurodollar Rate Advances then outstanding, (a) the Company shall pay any amounts
owing pursuant to Section  9.04(d) as a result of the  distributions  to Lenders
under  this  Section  2.05(c)(v)  and (b) for each  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing
comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances,  the respective Revolving Credit Advances
made by the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders pursuant to this Section
2.05(c)(v)  shall be Base Rate Advances  until the last day of the then existing
Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.06.  REPAYMENT OF REVOLVING  CREDIT  ADVANCES.  Each
Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable  account of the Lenders on the
Final  Maturity Date the  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Revolving  Credit
Advances then outstanding in respect of such Borrower.

                  SECTION  2.07.  INTEREST ON  REVOLVING  CREDIT  ADVANCES.  (a)
SCHEDULED  INTEREST.  Each Borrower  shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal
amount of each  Revolving  Credit  Advance owing by such Borrower to each Lender
from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount shall
be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

                  (i) BASE RATE ADVANCES.  During such periods as such Revolving
         Credit  Advance is a Base Rate  Advance,  a rate per annum equal at all
         times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect  from time to time PLUS
         (y) at all times that the  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Advance
         exceeds 50% of the aggregate  Commitments,  0.10% per annum, payable in
         arrears  quarterly on the last day of each  February,  May,  August and
         November  during such  periods  and on the date such Base Rate  Advance
         shall be Converted or paid in full.

                  (ii)  EURODOLLAR  RATE  ADVANCES.  During such periods as such
         Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum
         equal at all times  during  each  Interest  Period  for such  Revolving
         Credit Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar  Rate for such Interest
         Period for such  Revolving  Credit Advance PLUS (y) .20% per annum PLUS
         (z) at all times that the  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Advance
         exceeds 50% of the aggregate  Commitments,  0.10% per annum, payable in
         arrears on the last day of such  Interest  Period and, if such Interest
         Period  has a  duration  of more than  three  months,  on each day that
         occurs  during such  Interest  Period every three months from the first
         day of such  Interest  Period  and on the  date  such  Eurodollar  Rate
         Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                  (b)  DEFAULT  INTEREST.  Upon the  occurrence  and  during the
continuance  of an Event of Default under Section  6.01(a),  each Borrower shall
pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance
owing by such Borrower to each Lender,  payable in arrears on the dates referred
to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above,  at a rate per annum equal at all times to
2% per  annum  above the rate per annum  required  to be paid on such  Revolving
Credit  Advance  pursuant  to  clause  (a)(i) or  (a)(ii)  above and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount
payable hereunder by such Borrower that is not paid when due, from the date such
amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full,  payable in arrears
on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum
equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum  required to be paid
on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

                  (c)  ADDITIONAL  INTEREST ON  EURODOLLAR  RATE  ADVANCES.  The
applicable  Borrower  shall pay to each Lender,  so long as such Lender shall be
required  under  regulations  of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve
System to maintain  reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of
or  including  Eurocurrency  Liabilities,  additional  interest  on  the  unpaid

                                       23
<PAGE>

principal  amount  of  each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance  of such  Lender  to such
Borrower,  from the date of such Advance until such principal  amount is paid in
full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained
by subtracting  (i) the Eurodollar  Rate for the applicable  Interest Period for
such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such  Eurodollar  Rate by a
percentage  equal to 100% MINUS the Eurodollar  Rate Reserve  Percentage of such
Lender  for such  Interest  Period,  payable on each date on which  interest  is
payable on such Advance.  Such  additional  interest shall be determined by such
Lender and notified in reasonable detail to such Borrower through the Agent.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 2.08. INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION.  (a) Each Reference
Bank  agrees to  furnish  to the Agent  timely  information  for the  purpose of
determining  each  Eurodollar Rate and each LIBO Rate. If any one or more of the
Reference  Banks shall not furnish such timely  information to the Agent for the
purpose of determining  any such interest  rate, the Agent shall  determine such
interest  rate on the basis of timely  information  furnished  by the  remaining
Reference  Banks.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the relevant  Borrowers
and the Lenders of the  applicable  interest  rate  determined  by the Agent for
purposes of Section  2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by each
Reference  Bank for the purpose of  determining  the interest rate under Section
2.07(a)(ii).

                  (b) If, with  respect to any  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  the
Majority  Lenders  notify the Agent that the  Eurodollar  Rate for any  Interest
Period for such Advances will not  adequately  reflect the cost to such Majority
Lenders of making,  funding or  maintaining  their  respective  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances  for such  Interest  Period  (which  cost each such  Lender  reasonably
determines in good faith is material),  the Agent shall forthwith so notify each
Borrower  and the  Lenders,  whereupon  (i) each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance will
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert  into a Base Rate  Advance,  and (ii) the  obligation  of the Lenders to
make, or to Convert  Revolving  Credit  Advances into,  Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders
that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  (c)  If  any  Borrower,   in  requesting  a  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing  comprised  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  shall  fail to select the
duration of the Interest  Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance
with the provisions  contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section
1.01,  the Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such
Advances  will  automatically,  on the last day of the  then  existing  Interest
Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of  Eurodollar  Rate Advances  comprising  any  Borrowing  shall be reduced,  by
payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (e) Upon the  occurrence  and  during the  continuance  of any
Event of Default,  (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will  automatically,  on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate


                                       24
<PAGE>

Advance and (ii) the  obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert  Advances
into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

                  (f)  If  fewer  than  two  Reference   Banks  furnish   timely
information to the Agent for  determining  the Eurodollar  Rate or LIBO Rate for
any  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or LIBO Rate  Advances,  as the case may be, such
Eurodollar Rate or LIBO Rate shall be the interest rate per annum  determined by
the Agent to be the offered rate per annum at which deposits in U.S. dollars for
a maturity  comparable to the Interest  Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances
or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may be, appears on the Telerate Page 3750 (or
any  successor  page) as of 11:00 A.M.  (London time) two Business Days prior to
the first day of such  Interest  Period (the  "TELERATE");  PROVIDED that if the
Telerate is not then available:

                  (i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the relevant Borrower and
         the  Lenders  that the  interest  rate  cannot be  determined  for such
         Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may be;

                  (ii) with  respect  to  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  each such
         Advance  will  automatically,  on the  last  day of the  then  existing
         Interest Period therefor,  Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if such
         Advance  is then a Base  Rate  Advance,  will  continue  as a Base Rate
         Advance); and

                  (iii) the  obligation of the Lenders to make  Eurodollar  Rate
         Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to Convert  Revolving Credit Advances
         into  Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall
         notify each  Borrower  and the Lenders that the  circumstances  causing
         such suspension no longer exist.

                  SECTION  2.09.   OPTIONAL   CONVERSION  OF  REVOLVING   CREDIT
ADVANCES.  Any Borrower may on any Business  Day, upon notice given to the Agent
not later than 11:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the third  Business Day prior
to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections
2.08 and 2.12,  Convert all Revolving Credit Advances of one Type comprising the
same  Borrowing  into  Revolving  Credit  Advances of the other Type;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances
shall be made only on the last day of an  Interest  Period  for such  Eurodollar
Rate Advances.  Each such notice of a Conversion shall,  within the restrictions
specified  above,  specify (i) the date of such  Conversion,  (ii) the Revolving
Credit Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar
Rate  Advances,  the  duration  of the  initial  Interest  Period  for each such
Advance.  Each  notice of  Conversion  shall be  irrevocable  and binding on the
relevant Borrower.

                  SECTION  2.10.   OPTIONAL   PREPAYMENTS  OF  REVOLVING  CREDIT
ADVANCES.  Any Borrower  may, upon notice to the Agent stating the proposed date
and aggregate  principal  amount of the  prepayment,  given not later than 11:00
A.M.  (New York City time) on the second  Business Day prior to the date of such
proposed prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, and not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of such proposed  prepayment,  in the
case of Base Rate  Advances,  and, if such notice is given such Borrower  shall,

                                       25
<PAGE>

prepay  the  outstanding  principal  amount  of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
comprising  part of the same Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in whole or ratably in
part,  together  with  accrued  interest to the date of such  prepayment  on the
principal amount prepaid;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that (x) each partial prepayment
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance,  such  Borrower  shall be obligated to reimburse  the
Lenders  in  respect  thereof  pursuant  to  Section  9.04(d).  Each  notice  of
prepayment  by a Designated  Subsidiary  shall be given to the Agent through the
Company.


                  SECTION 2.11.  INCREASED COSTS. (a) If, after the date hereof,
due to either (i) the  introduction  of or any change  (other than any change by
way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar
Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or
(ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  over any Lender  (whether  or not
having the force of law),  there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender
(which cost such Lender  reasonably  determines  in good faith is  material)  of
agreeing to make or making,  funding or maintaining  Eurodollar Rate Advances or
LIBO  Rate  Advances  (excluding  for  purposes  of this  Section  2.11 any such
increased  costs  resulting  from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which  Section
2.14 shall govern) and (ii) Excluded Taxes),  then the Borrower of such Advances
shall from time to time,  upon demand by such Lender made not later than 60 days
after such Lender obtains knowledge of such increased costs (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional
amounts  sufficient  to compensate  such Lender for such  increased  cost.  Each
Lender agrees that if such Lender  requests  compensation  for any amounts owing
from a Borrower for such increased cost under this Section 2.11(a),  such Lender
shall,  prior to a Borrower being required to pay such increased costs,  furnish
to such  Borrower a  certificate  of a senior  financial  officer of such Lender
verifying that such increased cost was actually  incurred by such Lender and the
amount of such increased  cost and setting forth in reasonable  detail the basis
therefore  (with a copy of such  certificate to the Agent);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that such certificate  shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,  absent
manifest error.

                  (b) If,  after the date  hereof,  any Lender  determines  that
compliance  with any law or  regulation  or any  guideline  or request  from any
central bank or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over any Lender
(whether or not having the force of law)  affects or would  affect the amount of
capital  required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling  such Lender and that the amount of such  capital is increased by or
based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other
commitments of this type,  then,  upon demand by such Lender made not later than
60 days after such Lender obtains  knowledge of such increase in capital (with a
copy of such  demand to the Agent),  the Company  shall pay to the Agent for the
account  of  such  Lender,  from  time  to time  as  specified  by such  Lender,
additional  amounts  sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in
the light of such  circumstances,  to the  extent  that such  Lender  reasonably
determines  such  increase in capital to be allocable  to the  existence of such
Lender's  commitment to lend  hereunder.  Each Lender agrees that if such Lender
requests  compensation  for any amounts owing from the Company for such increase
in capital under this Section  2.11(b),  such Lender shall,  prior to a Borrower

                                       26
<PAGE>


being required to compensate  such Lender for such increase in capital,  furnish
to the  Company a  certificate  of a senior  financial  officer  of such  Lender
verifying that such increase in capital was actually required by such Lender and
the amount of such increase in capital and setting  forth in  reasonable  detail
the basis  therefore (with a copy of such  certificate to the Agent);  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that such certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

         (c) No Borrower  shall be  obligated to pay under this Section 2.11 any
amounts which relate to costs or increases of capital  incurred  prior to the 12
months  immediately  preceding  the date of demand for payment of such  amounts,
unless the applicable law,  regulation,  guideline or request  resulting in such
costs or increases of capital is imposed retroactively.  In the case of any law,
regulation,  guideline  or request  which is imposed  retroactively,  the Lender
making demand for payment of any amount under this Section 2.11 shall notify the
related  Borrower not later than 12 months from the date that such Lender should
reasonably have known (but promptly upon gaining  knowledge of such increase) of
such law,  regulation,  guideline or request and such  Borrower's  obligation to
compensate  such  Lender for such  amount is  contingent  upon such  Lender's so
notifying such Borrower;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that any failure by such Lender to
provide  such notice  shall not affect such  Borrower's  obligations  under this
Section  2.11 with  respect to amounts  resulting  from  costs or  increases  of
capital incurred after the date which occurs 12 months immediately preceding the
date on which  such  Lender  notified  such  Borrower  of such law,  regulation,
guideline or request.

         (d) If any Lender shall subsequently  recoup any costs (other than from
a Borrower) for which such Lender has theretofore been compensated by a Borrower
under this  Section  2.11,  such Lender  shall remit to such  Borrower an amount
equal to the amount of such recoupment as reasonably determined by such Lender.

                  SECTION 2.12. ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement,  if any Lender shall after the date hereof,  notify the Agent
that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation  makes  it  unlawful,  or any  central  bank  or  other  governmental
authority having  jurisdiction over any Lender asserts that it is unlawful,  for
any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder
to make  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to fund or maintain
Eurodollar  Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances  hereunder,  (i) each Eurodollar
Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance, as the case may be, will automatically,  upon
such demand,  Convert into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest
at the rate set forth in  Section  2.07(a)(i),  as the case may be, and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances
or to Convert  Revolving  Credit Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  SECTION  2.13.  PAYMENTS AND  COMPUTATIONS.  (a) Each Borrower
shall make each payment  hereunder  and under the Notes not later than 1:00 P.M.
(New York  City  time) on the day when due in U.S.  dollars  to the Agent at the
Agent's Account in same day funds.  The Agent will promptly  thereafter cause to
be  distributed  like funds  relating to the payment of principal or interest or

                                       27
<PAGE>

facility  fees ratably  (other than amounts  payable  pursuant to Section  2.03,
2.05(c), 2.07(c), 2.11, 2.14, 2.18(a) or 9.04(cd) to the Lenders for the account
of their respective  Applicable Lending Offices,  and like funds relating to the
payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account
of its Applicable  Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance
and recording of the information  contained  therein in the Register pursuant to
Section 9.07(c),  from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment
and Acceptance,  the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes
in respect of the interest  assigned thereby to the Lender assignee  thereunder,
and the parties to such  Assignment  and Acceptance  shall make all  appropriate
adjustments  in such payments for periods prior to such  effective date directly
between  themselves.  Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender  hereunder as a
result  of the  effectiveness  of a  Commitment  Increase  pursuant  to  Section
2.05(c),  and upon the Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and
recording the information contained therein in the Register,  from and after the
relevant  Increase Date,  the Agent shall make all payments  hereunder and under
the Notes in respect of the interest assumed thereby to such Assuming Lender.

                  (b) All  computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall
be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may
be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal
Funds  Rate and of  facility  fees  shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a
year of 360 days,  in each case for the  actual  number of days  (including  the
first day but  excluding  the last day)  occurring  in the period for which such
interest or facility  fees are payable.  Each  determination  by the Agent of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

                  (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business  Day, such payment shall be made
on the next  succeeding  Business Day, and such  extension of time shall in such
case be included in the  computation  of payment of interest or facility fee, as
the case may be; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that, if such extension would cause payment
of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances to
be made in the next following  calendar month, such payment shall be made on the
next preceding Business Day.

                  (d)  Unless  the  Agent  shall  have  received  notice  from a
Borrower  prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders from such
Borrower  hereunder  that such Borrower will not make such payment in full,  the
Agent may assume that such  Borrower  has made such payment in full to the Agent
on such date and the Agent may, in reliance  upon such  assumption,  cause to be
distributed  to each Lender on such due date an amount  equal to the amount then
due such Lender.  If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such
payment in full to the Agent,  each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount  distributed to such Lender  together with interest  thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is  distributed  to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  SECTION 2.14. TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by each Borrower
hereunder or under the Notes shall be made,  in  accordance  with Section  2.13,
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions,  charges or withholdings,  and all liabilities with
respect  thereto,  EXCLUDING,  in the case of each  Lender and the Agent,  taxes
imposed on its overall net income,  and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of
net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political  subdivision thereof or
by any  jurisdiction  in which such  Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is
doing  business that is unrelated to this Agreement and such net income taxes or
franchise taxes that would not have been imposed if such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) had not been  conducting  such  unrelated  business and, in the
case of each  Lender,  taxes  imposed on its overall net income,  and  franchise
taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income  taxes,  by the  jurisdiction  of such
Lender's  Applicable  Lending Office or any political  subdivision  thereof (all
such excluded taxes being  hereinafter  referred to as "EXCLUDED  TAXES" and all
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,  charges, withholdings and
liabilities  in  respect  of  payments   hereunder  or  under  the  Notes  being
hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum  payable  hereunder  or under any
Note to any Lender or the Agent,  (i) the sum payable  shall be increased as may
be necessary so that after making all required  deductions for Taxes  (including
deductions  for Taxes  applicable to additional  sums payable under this Section
2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)  receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have  received  had no such  deductions  been  made,  (ii) such
Borrower  shall make such  deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full
amount  deducted  to the  relevant  taxation  authority  or other  authority  in
accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition,  each  Borrower  agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar  levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes
or from the  execution,  delivery  or  registration  of,  performing  under,  or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter  referred to
as "OTHER TAXES").

                  (c) Each Borrower  shall  indemnify  each Lender and the Agent
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,  without limitation, any
taxes imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable under this Section 2.14)
imposed  on or paid by such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case may be) and any
liability for penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the
date  such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case  may be)  makes  written  demand
therefor; PROVIDED that such Lender shall, prior to a Borrower being required to
indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14(c), furnish to such Borrower
a certificate of a senior  financial  officer of such Lender verifying that such
Taxes or Other  Taxes were  actually  incurred  by such Lender and the amount of
such  Taxes or Other  Taxes and  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail the basis
therefor (with a copy of such certificate to the Agent), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
such  certificate  shall be  conclusive  and  binding for all  purposes,  absent
manifest error.

                  (d)  Within 30 days  after the date of any  payment  of Taxes,
each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address  referred to in Section
9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt  evidencing payment thereof.

                                       29

In the case of any payment  hereunder  or under the Notes by or on behalf of any
Borrower  through  an account or branch  outside  the United  States or by or on
behalf of any Borrower by a payor that is not a United  States  person,  if such
Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof,  such Borrower
shall  furnish,  or shall  cause such payor to  furnish,  to the Agent,  at such
address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment
is exempt from Taxes.  For purposes of this  subsection (d) and subsection  (e),
the terms  "UNITED  STATES" and "UNITED  STATES  PERSON" shall have the meanings
specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

                  (e) Each  Lender  organized  under the laws of a  jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this  Agreement  in the case of each  Initial  Lender  and on the date of the
Assignment  and  Acceptance  or the  Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,
pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from
time to time  thereafter  as requested  in writing by any Borrower  (but only so
long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Agent and
each Borrower with two original  Internal Revenue Service forms 1001 or 4224, as
appropriate,  or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal  Revenue
Service,  certifying  that such  Lender is exempt  from or entitled to a reduced
rate of United States  withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or
the  Notes.  If the forms  provided  by a Lender at the time such  Lender  first
becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding
tax rate in excess of zero,  withholding  tax at such rate  shall be  considered
excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate  forms
certifying that a lesser rate applies,  whereupon withholding tax at such lesser
rate only shall be considered  excluded from Taxes for periods  governed by such
form; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
or the  Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,  pursuant  to which a Lender
assignee becomes a party to this Agreement,  the Lender assignor was entitled to
payments under  subsection (a) in respect of United States  withholding tax with
respect to interest  paid at such date,  then,  to such  extent,  the term Taxes
shall  include  (in  addition  to  withholding  taxes that may be imposed in the
future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding
tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.

                  (f) For any period  with  respect to which a Lender has failed
to provide each Borrower with the appropriate  form described in Section 2.14(e)
(OTHER THAN if such failure is due to a change in law  occurring  subsequent  to
the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form
otherwise is not required  under the first  sentence of  subsection  (e) above),
such Lender shall not be entitled to  indemnification  under Section  2.14(a) or
(c) with  respect  to Taxes  imposed  by the  United  States  by  reason of such
failure; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because
of its failure to deliver a form required  hereunder,  each  Borrower  agrees to
take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to
recover such Taxes.

                  (g) If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion,  that it
has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, deduction or credit of
any Taxes or Other Taxes paid or reimbursed by a Borrower pursuant to subjection
(a) or (c) above in respect of payments under the Credit Agreement or the Notes,
a current monetary  benefit that it would otherwise not have obtained,  and that

                                       30
<PAGE>


would result in the total  payments under this Section 2.14 exceeding the amount
needed to make such Lender whole,  such Lender shall pay to such Borrower,  with
reasonable  promptness  following  the date on which it actually  realizes  such
benefit,  an amount  equal to the  lesser of the  amount of such  benefit or the
amount of such excess, in each case net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
in securing such refund, deduction or credit.


                  SECTION  2.15.  SHARING OF PAYMENTS,  ETC. If any Lender shall
obtain any payment (whether voluntary,  involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off,  or  otherwise) on account of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
owing to it (other  than  pursuant  to Section  2.05(c),  2.07(c),  2.11,  2.14,
2.18(a) or 9.04(d)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the
Revolving  Credit  Advances  obtained  by all the  Lenders,  such  Lender  shall
forthwith  purchase from the other Lenders such  participations in the Revolving
Credit  Advances  owing to them as shall be necessary  to cause such  purchasing
Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if all or any portion of such excess  payment is thereafter  recovered from
such  purchasing  Lender,  such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and
such  Lender  shall repay to the  purchasing  Lender the  purchase  price to the
extent of such recovery  together with an amount equal to such Lender's  ratable
share  (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's  required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the  purchasing  Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total  amount so  recovered.  Each  Borrower  agrees  that any  Lender so
purchasing a  participation  from another  Lender  pursuant to this Section 2.15
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,  exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such  participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct  creditor of such  Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

                  SECTION  2.16.  USE OF PROCEEDS.  The proceeds of the Advances
shall be available  (and each Borrower  agrees that it shall use such  proceeds)
solely (i) for general corporate  purposes of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries
and (ii) for  acquisitions by such Borrower that have been approved by the Board
of Directors of the corporation that is to be acquired by such Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.17. MANDATORY ASSIGNMENT BY A LENDER; MITIGATION. If
any Lender  requests from a Borrower  either  payment of additional  interest on
Eurodollar  Rate Advances  pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  or  reimbursement  for
increased  costs  pursuant to Section 2.11, or payment of or  reimbursement  for
Taxes  pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender  notifies the Agent that it is
unlawful  for such  Lender  or its  Eurodollar  Lending  Office to  perform  its
obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 2.12, (i) such Lender will, upon three
Business  Days'  notice by such  Borrower to such  Lender and the Agent,  to the
extent not  inconsistent  with such Lender's  internal  policies and  applicable
legal and  regulatory  restrictions,  use  reasonable  efforts to make,  fund or
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances through another  Eurodollar Lending Office
of such Lender if (A) as a result thereof the additional  amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  2.11 or 2.14, as  applicable,  in respect of
such Eurodollar  Rate Advances would be materially  reduced or the provisions of
Section  2.12  would  not  apply  to  such  Lender,  as  applicable,  and (B) as
determined by such Lender in good faith but in its sole  discretion,  the making
or maintaining of such  Eurodollar Rate Advances  through such other  Eurodollar

                                       31
<PAGE>

Lending  Office  would  not  otherwise  materially  and  adversely  affect  such
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  or such  Lender  and (ii)  unless  such  Lender  has
therefore taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured (to the extent
not  inconsistent  with internal  policies and  applicable  legal and regulatory
restrictions),  the conditions  creating such  obligation to pay such additional
amounts or the  circumstances  described in Section 2.12, such Lender will, upon
at least five  Business  Days'  notice  from the  Company to such Lender and the
Agent,  assign,  pursuant to and in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section
9.07, to one or more Eligible  Assignees  designated by the Company all, but not
less than all, of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances then owing to such Lender and
all, but not less than all, of such Lender's  rights and  obligations  hereunder
(other  than  rights in respect of such  Lender's  outstanding  Competitive  Bid
Advance),  without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender, for a
purchase price equal to the  outstanding  principal  amount of each such Advance
then owing to such Lender PLUS any accrued but unpaid  interest  thereon and any
accrued but unpaid facility fees owing thereto and, in addition,  all additional
costs reimbursements,  expense reimbursements and indemnities,  if any, owing in
respect of such Lender's Commitment hereunder at such time shall be paid to such
Lender.

                  SECTION 2.18.  EXTENSION OF THE TERMINATION DATE AND THE FINAL
MATURITY DATE..  (a) EXTENSION OF THE TERMINATION  DATE. (i) The Company may, at
its option,  by written notice to the Agent in substantially the form of Exhibit
E-1  hereto,  no  earlier  than 60 days and no later  that 30 days  prior to the
Termination  Date  then  in  effect,   request  that  the  Lenders  extend  such
Termination  Date for an  additional  period of 364 days.  Such request shall be
irrevocable  and binding upon the Company.  The Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender  of  such  request.  If a  Lender  agrees,  in its  individual  and  sole
discretion,  to so extend its  Commitment  (each such Lender being an "EXTENDING
LENDER"),  it shall deliver to the Agent a written notice in  substantially  the
form of Exhibit E-2 hereto of its agreement to do so no earlier than 30 days and
no later than 25 days prior to such  Termination Date and the Agent shall notify
the  Company in  writing  of such  Extending  Lender's  agreement  to extend its
Commitment no later than 20 days prior to such Termination Date.

                  (ii) If any  Lender  does not  consent,  or  fails to  respond
within the time  period set forth in clause (i) of this  Section  2.18(a),  to a
request by the Company for an extension of the  Termination  Date then in effect
(each such Lender being a "DECLINING LENDER"),  the Company shall have the right
to:

                  (A) require any Declining  Lender to assign in full its rights
         and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (I)  to an  Extending  Lender
         designated  by the Company that has offered to increase its  Commitment
         in an amount at least  equal to the amount of such  Declining  Lender's
         Commitment in its notice delivered to the Agent under subsection (a) of
         this Section  2.18 (each such  Extending  Lender  being an  "INCREASING
         EXTENDING  LENDER")  and (II) to the  extent  of any  shortfall  in the
         aggregate  amount  of  extended   Commitments,   to  any  other  Person
         designated by the Company and acceptable to the Agent (which acceptance
         shall not be  unreasonably  withheld) that agrees to accept all of such
         rights and  obligations  (each such other Person  being a  "REPLACEMENT
         LENDER"), PROVIDED, that (w) such assignment is otherwise in compliance
         with Section 9.07, (x) such Declining  Lender receives  payment in full


                                       32
<PAGE>

         of the  aggregate  principal  amount  of all  Advances  owing  to  such
         Declining Lender, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
         to the effective date of such assignment and all fees and other accrued
         and unpaid amounts owing to such  Declining  Lender under any provision
         of this Agreement  (including,  but not limited to, any increased costs
         or other additional  amounts owing under Section 2.11, and any Taxes or
         Other Taxes owing under Section 2.14) as of the effective  date of such
         assignment,   (y)  with  respect  to  any  Replacement   Lender,   such
         Replacement  Lender  shall  have  paid the  applicable  processing  and
         recordation  fee required under Section 9.07(a) for such assignment and
         (z) such assignment  shall be effective on or prior to such Termination
         Date; or

                  (B) subject to the giving of notice to such  Declining  Lender
         at least five days prior to such Termination Date, pay, prepay or cause
         to be  prepaid,  on and  effective  as of such  Termination  Date,  the
         aggregate  principal  amount of all  Advances  owing to such  Declining
         Lender,  together with all accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon to the
         date of such payment, and all fees and other accrued and unpaid amounts
         owing to such  Declining  Lender under any provision of this  Agreement
         (including, but not limited to, any increased costs or other additional
         amounts owing under  Section  2.11,  and any Taxes or Other Taxes owing
         under Section 2.14) as of the date of such payment or  prepayment,  and
         terminate in whole such Declining Lender's Commitment,  notwithstanding
         the provisions of Section 2.05(a).

                  (iii) The  Company  shall,  no later  than one day  before the
Termination Date then in effect, deliver to the Agent a notice setting forth the
Commitments of the Extending Lenders and the Replacement  Lenders, if any, which
are to become or be, as the case may be, effective as of such Termination  Date.
If Extending  Lenders  and/or  Replacement  Lenders  provide  Commitments  in an
aggregate  amount  at  least  equal  to  51%  of  the  aggregate  amount  of the
Commitments  outstanding  immediately  prior to such Termination Date, the Agent
shall give  prompt  notice  thereof to the  Lenders  and,  effective  as of such
Termination  Date,  (A) the  Termination  Date shall be extended by 364 days for
such Extending Lenders and such Replacement  Lenders,  SUBJECT,  HOWEVER, to the
provisions of subsection  (b) of this Section 2.18,  (B) each  Declining  Lender
shall have no  further  Commitment  hereunder  and (C) the  Commitments  of such
Extending  Lenders and such Replacement  Lenders shall become or be, as the case
may be the  amounts  specified  in the notice  delivered  by the  Company to the
Agent.

                  (b) EXTENSION OF THE FINAL MATURITY  DATE. On the  Termination
Date in effect at any time, if no Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company may, by written notice to the Agent, request that the Final Maturity
Date be a date occurring up to the first  anniversary of such Termination  Date.
Such request shall be irrevocable and binding upon the Company.  The Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of such request.  Subject to the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.05 as of such Termination Date, the
Final Maturity Date shall be, effective as of such  Termination  Date, such date
as the Company shall  request  pursuant to this  subsection  (b) of this Section
2.18. In the event that the Company  shall request that the Final  Maturity Date
be a  date  occurring  up  to  the  first  anniversary  of  the  then  scheduled
Termination  Date,  and the Final Maturity Date shall be so extended as provided

                                       33
<PAGE>


in this subsection (b) of this Section 2.18, the right of the Company to request
an extension of the Termination  Date pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section
2.18 shall automatically  terminate and any extension of the Termination Date in
effect at the time such request is made that would  otherwise  occur as provided
in subsection  (a) of this Section 2.18 shall  automatically  be cancelled.  The
Agent  shall  promptly  notify each  Lender of any such  extension  of the Final
Maturity Date and any such cancellation of an extension of the Termination Date.

         result of which the information  concerning such Borrower that has been
         provided  to the Agent and each Lender by such  Borrower in  connection

by notice to the Lenders,  designates as the proposed Effective Date, specifying
its  objection  thereto.  The Agent  shall  promptly  notify the  Lenders of the

         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body

<PAGE>

         Consolidated   results  of  the  operations  of  the  Company  and  its
         Subsidiaries  for the periods  ended on such dates,  all in  accordance
         with generally accepted  accounting  principles  consistently  applied;
         PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that said balance sheet and statements of income and

         prepared in accordance  with  applicable  rules and  regulations of the
         Securities and Exchange Commission.  Since December 31, 1998, there has
         been no Material Adverse Change.

                  (f) (i) There is no pending  or, to the  Company's  knowledge,
         threatened  action,  suit,  investigation,  litigation  or  proceeding,
         including,  without limitation, any Environmental Action, affecting the
         Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries  before  any  court,  governmental
         agency  or  arbitrator  that (A) would be  reasonably  likely to have a
         Material  Adverse  Effect (other than the Disclosed  Litigation) or (B)
         purports to affect the  legality,  validity or  enforceability  of this
         Agreement  or  any  Note  or  the   consummation  of  the  transactions
         contemplated  hereby,  and (ii) there has been no adverse change in the
         status,  or financial effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken
         as a whole, of the Disclosed Litigation from that described on Schedule
         3.01(b) hereto.

                  (g) No proceeds  of any Advance  will be applied in any manner
         that will  violate  or cause  any  Lender to  violate  Regulation  U or
         Regulation G issued by the Board of  Governors  of the Federal  Reserve
         System.

                  (h) The Company is not, and immediately  after the application
         by the  Company  of the  proceeds  of each  Advance  will  not  be,  an
         "investment  company",  or a  company  "controlled"  by an  "investment
         company",  as such terms are defined in the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940, as amended.

                  (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance
         with all applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations and orders,  including,
         without  limitation,  ERISA and  Environmental  Laws and  Environmental
         Permits,  except where the failure to so comply would not be reasonably
         likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (j) To the Company's  knowledge,  (i) all past  non-compliance
         with any Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits has been resolved
         without  ongoing  obligations  or costs  except where the failure to so
         comply would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
         and (ii) no circumstances  exist that would be reasonably likely to (A)
         form the basis of an Environmental Action against the Company or any of
         its  Subsidiaries  or any of their  properties that would be reasonably
         likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (B) cause any such property
         to be subject  to any  restrictions  on  ownership,  occupancy,  use or
         transferability  under any  Environmental  Law that would be reasonably
         likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (k) No ERISA Event that would be  reasonably  likely to have a
         Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
         with respect to any Plan.

         annual  report (Form 5500 Series) for each Plan whose  "funded  current
         liability  percentage"  is less  than 90% and whose  "unfunded  current
         liability"  exceeds  $5,000,000  (as such terms are  defined in Section
         302(d)(8) of ERISA),  copies of which have been filed with the Internal
         Revenue Service and furnished to the Lenders,  is complete and accurate
         and fairly presents in all material respects the funding status of such
         Plan.

                  (m)  Neither  the   Company  nor  any  ERISA   Affiliate   has
         outstanding  liability  with respect to, or is  reasonably  expected to
         incur any Withdrawal Liability to, any Multiemployer Plan that would be
         reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (n)  Neither  the  Company  nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
         Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within the meaning of
         Title  IV of  ERISA,  and no  such  Multiemployer  Plan  is  reasonably
         expected  to be in  reorganization  or to  be  terminated,  within  the
         meaning of Title IV of ERISA, where such  reorganization or termination
         would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (o) Except as set forth in the financial  statements  referred
         to in Section  4.01(e)  and in Section  5.01(h),  the  Company  and its
         Subsidiaries  taken as a whole have no material  liability with respect
         to "expected post retirement benefit obligations" within the meaning of
         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106.

         Laws as provided  in Section  5.01(i),  except  where the failure to so

         of its Subsidiaries to pay and discharge,  before the same shall become

         and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its property
         and (ii) all lawful claims that,  if unpaid,  will by law become a Lien
         upon its property;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither the Company nor any
         of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax,
         assessment,  charge or claim that is being  contested in good faith and

         Subsidiary operates.

         shall be required to preserve  any right or  franchise  if the Board of
         Directors of the Company or such  Subsidiary  shall  determine that the
         preservation  thereof  is no longer  desirable  in the  conduct  of the
         business  of the  Company or such  Subsidiary,  as the case may be, and
         that the loss thereof would not be reasonably likely to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

         Adverse Effect.

                           (vi) the  replacement,  extension  or  renewal of any

         proposed transaction or would result therefrom.

                  (c)      CHANGE IN NATURE OF BUSINESS.  Make, or permit any of
        its Subsidiaries to make, any  material change in the nature of its

         Designation  Letter,  or  by  any  Borrower  in  connection  with  this
         Agreement  shall prove to have been  incorrect in any material  respect
         when made; or

         any such proceeding  instituted  against it (but not instituted by it),
         either such  proceeding  shall  remain  undismissed  or unstayed  for a
         period of 60 days,  or any of the  actions  sought  in such  proceeding
         (including,  without  limitation,  the  entry  of an order  for  relief
         against, or the appointment of a receiver,  trustee, custodian or other
         similar  official for, it or for any substantial  part of its property)
         shall occur; or any Borrower or any of its Material  Subsidiaries shall

         reasonable opinion of the Majority Lenders,  shall be reasonably likely
         to incur  liability  in excess of  $75,000,000  in the  aggregate  as a

         its  ERISA   Affiliates  from  a  Multiemployer   Plan;  or  (iii)  the
         reorganization or termination of a Multiemployer Plan; or

                  (h) Any ERISA Event shall have occurred with respect to a Plan
         and the sum  (determined  as of the date of  occurrence  of such  ERISA

         and all other  Plans with  respect to which an ERISA  Event  shall have
         occurred and then exist (or the  liability of the Company and the ERISA

                                       47

         Affiliates related to such ERISA Event) exceeds $75,000,000; or

                  (i)  The  Company  or any  ERISA  Affiliate  shall  have  been
         notified by the sponsor of a  Multiemployer  Plan that it has  incurred
         Withdrawal Liability to such Multiemployer Plan in an amount that, when
         aggregated with all other amounts  required to be paid to Multiemployer
         Plans by the Company and the ERISA  Affiliates as Withdrawal  Liability
         (determined as of the date of such notification),  exceeds $75,000,000;
         or

                  (j)  The  Company  or any  ERISA  Affiliate  shall  have  been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
         Plan is in reorganization or is being terminated, within the meaning of
         Title  IV  of  ERISA,  and  as  a  result  of  such  reorganization  or
         termination the aggregate  annual  contributions of the Company and the
         ERISA  Affiliates  to  all   Multiemployer   Plans  that  are  then  in
         reorganization  or being terminated have been or will be increased over
         the amounts  contributed to such Multiemployer Plans for the plan years
         of such  Multiemployer  Plans  immediately  preceding  the plan year in
         which such  reorganization or termination occurs by an amount exceeding
         $75,000,000 in the aggregate;


then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the
consent,  of the  Majority  Lenders,  by notice to the  Company  and each  other
Borrower,  declare  the  obligation  of  each  Lender  to  make  Advances  to be
terminated,  whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the
request,  or may with the  consent,  of the Majority  Lenders,  by notice to the
Company and each other Borrower, declare the Notes, all interest thereon and all
other  amounts  payable  under this  Agreement to be forthwith  due and payable,
whereupon the Notes,  all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be
forthwith  due and  payable,  without  presentment,  demand,  protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby  expressly  waived by the Borrowers;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that in the event of an actual or deemed  entry of an order
for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Federal  Bankruptcy  Code, (A)
the  obligation  of each Lender to make  Advances to such  Borrower (or, if such
event has occurred in respect of the Company,  to make Advances to any Borrower)
shall  automatically  be terminated and (B) the Notes, all such interest and all
such amounts  owing by such  Borrower (or, if such event has occurred in respect
of the Company, owing by all of the Borrowers) shall automatically become and be
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers.

                                    GUARANTY

                  SECTION 7.01. GUARANTY.  For valuable  consideration,  receipt
whereof is hereby  acknowledged,  and to induce each Lender to make  Advances to
the  Designated  Subsidiaries  and to  induce  the Agent to act  hereunder,  the
Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each Lender and the

                                       48
<PAGE>

Agent the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise, of all obligations of the Designated Subsidiaries now or hereafter
existing  under this Agreement or the Notes,  whether for  principal,  interest,
fees, indemnities, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS"),  and agrees to pay any and all reasonable and documented expenses
(including  reasonable  counsel fees and expenses)  incurred by the Agent or any
Lender in  enforcing  any  rights  under this  Guaranty.  Without  limiting  the
generality of the foregoing, the Company's liability shall extend to all amounts
that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and that would be owed by any
Designated  Subsidiary  to the Agent or any Lender under this  Agreement and the
Notes but for the fact that such Guaranteed Obligations are unenforceable or not
allowable  due to the  existence  of a  bankruptcy,  reorganization  or  similar
proceeding involving such Designated Subsidiary.

                  SECTION 7.02.  GUARANTY ABSOLUTE.  The Company guarantees that
the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this  Agreement  regardless of any law,  regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the  rights of the
Agent or any Lender with respect  thereto.  The obligations of the Company under
this  Guaranty  are  independent  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or any  other
obligations of any Designated Subsidiary under this Agreement and the Notes, and
a separate  action or actions may be brought and prosecuted  against the Company
to enforce the  obligations of the Company under this Guaranty,  irrespective of
whether any action is brought  against any  Borrower or whether any  Borrower is
joined in any such action or actions.  The  liability of the Company  under this
Guaranty shall be irrevocable,  absolute and unconditional  irrespective of, and
the Company hereby  irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have
in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

                  (a)      any lack of validity or enforceability of this
         Agreement or the Notes, or any other agreement or instrument relating
         thereto;

                  (b) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations or any
         other obligations of any Designated  Subsidiary under this Agreement or
         the  Notes,  or any other  amendment  or waiver  of or any  consent  to
         departure  from  this  Agreement  or  any  Note,   including,   without
         limitation,  any increase in the Guaranteed  Obligations resulting from
         the extension of additional credit to any Designated  Subsidiary or any
         of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

                  (c)      any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or
         consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations;

                  (d)      any change, restructuring or termination of the
         corporate structure or existence of any Designated Subsidiary or any of
         its Subsidiaries;

                  (e) any  failure of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the
         Company or any Designated  Subsidiary any  information  relating to the
         financial  condition,  operations,   properties  or  prospects  of  any
         Designated  Subsidiary  now or in the future known to the Agent or such


                                       49
<PAGE>

         Lender, as the case may be (the Company waiving any duty on the part of
         the Agent or the Lenders to disclose such information); or

                  (f) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
         statute  of  limitations)  or  any  existence  of or  reliance  on  any
         representation  by  the  Agent  or  any  Lender  that  might  otherwise
         constitute a defense  available to, or a discharge  of, any  Designated
         Subsidiary or the Company or any other guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall  continue to be effective or be reinstated,  as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must  otherwise  be returned by the Agent or any Lender upon the  insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Designated  Subsidiary or otherwise,  all as
though such payment had not been made.

                  SECTION  7.03.  WAIVERS AND  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.  (a) The Company
hereby waives promptness,  diligence,  notice of acceptance and any other notice
with  respect to any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and this  Guaranty and any
requirement  that the Agent or any Lender  exhaust  any right or take any action
against any Designated Subsidiary or any other Person, and all other notices and
demands whatsoever.

                  (b) The  Company  hereby  waives  any  right  to  revoke  this
Guaranty,  and  acknowledges  that this  Guaranty  is  continuing  in nature and
applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

                  (c) The Company  acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect  benefits from the financing  arrangements  contemplated  by
this Agreement and the Notes and that the waivers set forth in this Section 7.03
are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

                  SECTION 7.04.  SUBROGATION.  The Company will not exercise any
rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against any Designated Subsidiary or
any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence,  payment, performance
or enforcement of the Company's obligations under this Guaranty or any provision
of this  Agreement or the Notes,  including,  without  limitation,  any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any
right to  participate  in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against
such  Designated  Subsidiary or any other insider  guarantor or any  collateral,
whether or not such claim,  remedy or right arises in equity or under  contract,
statute  or common  law,  including,  without  limitation,  the right to take or
receive from such Designated Subsidiary or any other insider guarantor, directly
or  indirectly,  in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim,  remedy or right, unless and until
all of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other  amounts  payable  under this
Guaranty  shall  have been paid in full in cash and the  Commitments  shall have
expired or  terminated.  If any amount shall be paid to the Company in violation
of the preceding  sentence at any time prior to the later of the payment in full
in cash of the Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty and the Final Maturity Date, such amount shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Agent and Lenders and shall  forthwith be paid to the Agent to be
credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable

                                       50
<PAGE>


under this Guaranty,  whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Notes,  or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed
Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty  thereafter arising. If
(i) the Company shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all or any part
of the Guaranteed  Obligations,  (ii) all of the Guaranteed  Obligations and all
other  amounts  payable  under this  Guaranty  shall be paid in full in cash and
(iii) the Final  Maturity  Date shall have  occurred,  the Agent and the Lenders
will, at the Company's  request and expense,  execute and deliver to the Company
appropriate documents,  without recourse and without representation or warranty,
necessary to evidence the transfer by  subrogation to the Company of an interest
in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment by the Company.


         SECTION  7.05.  CONTINUING  GUARANTY;   ASSIGNMENTS  UNDER  THE  CREDIT
AGREEMENT.  This Guaranty is a continuing  guaranty and shall (a) remain in full
force  and  effect  until  the  later  of the  payment  in  full  in cash of the
Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts  payable under this Agreement and
the Final  Maturity  Date,  (b) be binding upon the Company,  its successors and
assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable by the Agent and the
Lenders  and their  respective  successors,  transferees  and  assigns.  Without
limiting the  generality of the  foregoing  clause (c), any Lender may assign or
otherwise  transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations  under this
Agreement (including,  without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitment,
the Advances  owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person,
and such other Person  shall  thereupon  become  vested with all the benefits in
respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise,  in each case as and
to the extent provided in Section 9.07 of this Agreement.

         SECTION  7.06.  NO STAY.  The Company  agrees that,  as between (a) the
Company and (b) the Lenders and the Agent,  the  Guaranteed  Obligations  of any
Designated  Subsidiary guaranteed by the Company hereunder may be declared to be
forthwith  due and payable as provided in Article VI hereof for purposes of this
Guaranty by  declaration to the Company as guarantor  notwithstanding  any stay,
injunction or other  prohibition  preventing  such  declaration  as against such
Designated  Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration to the Company
as guarantor,  such  Guaranteed  Obligations  (whether or not due and payable by
such  Designated  Subsidiary),  shall  forthwith  become due and  payable by the
Company for purposes of this Guaranty.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    THE AGENT

                  SECTION  8.01.  AUTHORIZATION  AND ACTION.  Each Lender hereby
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers and discretion  under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Agent by the terms hereof,  together with such powers and  discretion as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including, without limitation,  enforcement or collection of the
Notes),  the Agent shall not be required to exercise any  discretion or take any
action,  but shall be  required  to act or to refrain  from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Majority Lenders,  and such  instructions  shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all  holders  of  Notes;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the  Agent  shall not be
required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this  Agreement  or  applicable  law. The Agent agrees to give to
each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by any Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.02. AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC. Neither the Agent nor any
of its directors,  officers,  agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or  omitted  to be taken by it or them  under or in  connection  with this
Agreement,  except for its or their own gross negligence or willful  misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing,  the Agent: (a) may treat
the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent receives and accepts
an  Assignment  and  Acceptance  entered into by the Lender that is the payee of
such Note, as assignor,  and an Eligible Assignee,  as assignee,  as provided in
Section  9.07;  (b) may consult with legal  counsel  (including  counsel for any
Borrower),  independent  public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance  with the advice of such counsel,  accountants or experts;  (c)
makes no warranty or  representation  to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection  with this  Agreement;  (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the  performance  or  observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of any Borrower
or to inspect the property  (including  the books and records) of any  Borrower;
(e) shall not be  responsible  to any  Lender for the due  execution,  legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or
any other instrument or document  furnished pursuant hereto; and (f) shall incur
no  liability  under or in respect of this  Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

                  SECTION  8.03.  CITIBANK AND  AFFILIATES.  With respect to its
Commitment,  the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it,  Citibank  shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise  the same as though it were not the  Agent;  and the term  "Lender"  or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly  indicated,  include Citibank in its
individual capacity.  Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money  to,  act as  trustee  under  indentures  of,  accept  investment  banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company,

                                       52
<PAGE>


any  of its  Subsidiaries  and  any  Person  who  may do  business  with  or own
securities  of the Company or any such  Subsidiary,  all as if Citibank were not
the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

                  SECTION 8.04. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has,  independently  and  without  reliance  upon the Agent or any other
Lender and based on the  financial  statements  referred to in Section  4.01 and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,  made its own
credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such  documents and  information  as it shall deem
appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.05. INDEMNIFICATION.  The Lenders agree to indemnify
the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by a Borrower), ratably according to the
respective  principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Notes then held by each of
them (or if no  Revolving  Credit  Notes are at the time  outstanding  or if any
Revolving  Credit  Notes  are  held by  Persons  that are not  Lenders,  ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments),  from and against any
and  all  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  or  disbursements  of any  kind or  nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in
any way  relating to or arising  out of this  Agreement  or any action  taken or
omitted by the Agent  under this  Agreement,  PROVIDED  that no Lender  shall be
liable  for any  portion  of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without limitation of
the  foregoing,  each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent  promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any  out-of-pocket  expenses  (including  counsel fees)
incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration,   modification,   amendment  or  enforcement   (whether  through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities  under, this Agreement,  to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by a Borrower.

                  SECTION  8.06.  SUCCESSOR  AGENT.  The Agent may resign at any
time by giving  written  notice thereof to the Lenders and each Borrower and may
be removed at any time with or without  cause by the  Majority  Lenders and such
resignation  or removal shall be effective  upon the  appointment of a successor
Agent. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the
right to appoint a successor  Agent,  subject to the Company's  approval  (which
shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).  If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Majority  Lenders,  and shall have accepted  such  appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders,  appoint a successor  Agent,  which shall be a commercial
bank  organized  under the laws of the United  States of America or of any State
thereof  and having a combined  capital  and  surplus of at least  $250,000,000,
subject to the Company's  approval (which shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor  Agent,
such successor Agent shall  thereupon  succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the

                                       53
<PAGE>


retiring Agent shall be discharged  from its duties and  obligations  under this
Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 9.01.  AMENDMENTS,  ETC. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this  Agreement or the Revolving  Credit Notes,  nor consent to any
departure by any Borrower therefrom,  shall in any event be effective unless the
same  shall be in  writing  and signed by the  Majority  Lenders,  and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that no amendment,  waiver
or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any of the
following: (a) increase the Commitment of any Lender (other than as provided for
in Section  2.05(c) or Section  2.18(a)) or subject any Lender to any additional
monetary obligations, (b) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Revolving
Credit Notes or any fees or other amounts  payable  hereunder,  (c) postpone any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Credit
Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than as provided for
under Section 2.18),  (d) release the Company from any of its obligations  under
Article VII or limit the  liability  of the Company  thereunder  or (e) amend or
waive this Section 9.01 or the  definition of "Majority  Lenders";  and PROVIDED
FURTHER that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by the Agent in  addition  to the Lenders  required  above to take such  action,
affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any Note.

                  SECTION   9.02.   NOTICES,   ETC.   All   notices   and  other
communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier,
telegraphic or telex communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed
or  delivered,  if to  the  Company  or to  any  Designated  Subsidiary,  at the
Company's  address at  Corporate  Headquarters,  100  Crystal A Drive,  Hershey,
Pennsylvania 17033-0810, Attention: Treasury Department, Fax No. (717) 534-6724;
if to any Initial Lender, at its Domestic Lending Office specified  opposite its
name on  Schedule I hereto;  if to any other  Lender,  at its  Domestic  Lending
Office  specified in the Assumption  Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance,
as the case may be,  pursuant to which it became a Lender;  and if to the Agent,
at its address at One Court Square,  Seventh  Floor,  Long Island City, New York
11120, Attention: Bank Loan Syndications,  Fax No. (718) 248-4844; or, as to any
Borrower  or the Agent,  at such other  address as shall be  designated  by such
party in a written  notice to the other parties and, as to each other party,  at
such other address as shall be  designated by such party in a written  notice to
the  Company and the Agent.  All such  notices and  communications  shall,  when
mailed,  telecopied,  telegraphed or telexed, be effective when deposited in the
mails,  telecopied,  delivered  to the  telegraph  company or confirmed by telex
answerback,  respectively,  except that notices and  communications to the Agent

Agent.  Delivery by  telecopier of an executed  counterpart  of any amendment or
waiver of any provision of this  Agreement or the Notes or of any Exhibit hereto

                                       54
<PAGE>


to be executed  and  delivered  hereunder  shall be  effective  as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart thereof.

                  SECTION 9.03. NO WAIVER;  REMEDIES.  No failure on the part of
any  Lender  or the Agent to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any right
hereunder  or under any Note shall  operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any
single or  partial  exercise  of any such  right  preclude  any other or further
exercise  thereof  or the  exercise  of any other  right.  The  remedies  herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  SECTION 9.04.  COSTS AND EXPENSES.  (a) The Company  agrees to
pay or cause to be paid on  demand  all  reasonable  and  documented  costs  and
expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration,  modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  (A)
all due  diligence,  syndication  (including  printing,  distribution  and  bank
meetings),  transportation,  computer,  duplication,  and  messenger  costs  and
expenses and (B) the reasonable  fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with
respect  thereto  and with  respect to  advising  the Agent as to its rights and
responsibilities  under this  Agreement.  The Company  further  agrees to pay or
cause to be paid on demand all reasonable  and documented  costs and expenses of
the Agent and the Lenders,  if any (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable
counsel fees and expenses),  in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement,  the Notes and
the other documents to be delivered  hereunder,  including,  without limitation,
reasonable  fees and  expenses  of  counsel  for the  Agent  and each  Lender in
connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 9.04(a).

                  (b) The Company  agrees to  indemnify  and hold  harmless  the
Agent  and  each  Lender  and  each of  their  Affiliates  and  their  officers,
directors,  employees,  agents and advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED  PARTY") from
and  against any and all  claims,  damages,  losses,  liabilities  and  expenses
(including,  without  limitation,  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that
may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each
case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with
the  preparation for a defense of, any  investigation,  litigation or proceeding
arising out of, related to or in connection with the Notes, this Agreement,  any
of the  transactions  contemplated  herein or the actual or proposed  use of the
proceeds  of the  Advances  whether  or not such  investigation,  litigation  or
proceeding  is  brought  by any  Borrower  or  the  directors,  shareholders  or
creditors  of any  Borrower or an  Indemnified  Party or any other Person or any
Indemnified  Party  is  otherwise  a  party  thereto  and  whether  or  not  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby are  consummated,  except to the extent  such
claim,  damage, loss, liability or expense results from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an  Indemnified  Party of notice
of the  commencement  of any action or proceeding  involving any claim,  damage,
loss or liability  referred to in paragraph (b) above,  such  Indemnified  Party
will,  if a claim in respect  thereof is to be made against any  Borrower,  give
written  notice to such Borrower of the  commencement  of such action;  PROVIDED
that the  failure of any  Indemnified  Party to give  notice as provided in this

                                       55
<PAGE>


Section  9.04(c)  shall not  relieve  such  Borrower  of its  obligations  under
paragraph  (b) above,  except  only to the extent  that such  Borrower  actually
suffers  damage solely as a result of such failure to give notice.  In the event
that any such action or  proceeding  is brought  against an  Indemnified  Party,
unless in such Indemnified  Party's sole judgment (based on advise of counsel) a
conflict of interest between such Indemnified  Party and a Borrower may exist in
respect thereof, such Borrower shall be entitled to participate in and to assume
the defense thereof with counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to such  Indemnified
Party. After notice from such Borrower to such Indemnified Party of its election
to  assume  the  defense  thereof,  such  Borrower  shall  not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified  Party in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable
costs of investigation). No Borrower shall consent to the entry of any dismissal
or judgment, or enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened action or
proceeding  against any Indemnified Party that is or could have been a party and
for whom indemnity  could have been sought under paragraph (b) above without the
consent of such Indemnified Party unless such judgment,  dismissal or settlement
includes  as an  unconditional  term  thereof  the giving of a release  from all
liability in respect of such action or  proceeding  to such  Indemnified  Party;
PROVIDED that each  Indemnified  Party agrees that, if a Borrower  reconfirms to
such  Indemnified  Party that it is indemnified from all liability in respect of
any such  action or  proceeding  referred  to in the  preceding  sentence,  such
Indemnified  Party  will not enter  into any  settlement  of any such  action or
proceeding  without the consent of such  Borrower  (which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld).  In addition to the foregoing,  each Borrower shall not,
in assuming  the defense of any  Indemnified  Party,  agree to any  dismissal or
settlement  without the prior written consent of such Indemnified  Party if such
dismissal or settlement  (A) would require any admission or  acknowledgement  of
culpability or wrongdoing by such Indemnified Party or (B) would provide for any
nonmonetary relief to any Persons to be performed by such Indemnified Party.

                  (d) If any  payment of  principal  of, or  Conversion  of, any
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance or LIBO Rate Advance is made by any Borrower to or for
the account of a Lender  other than on the last day of the  Interest  Period for
such  Advance,  as a result of (i) a payment or  Conversion  pursuant to Section
2.03(d),  2.10, 2.12 or 2.18(a),  (ii) a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section
2.05(c),  (iii)  acceleration  of the maturity of the Notes  pursuant to Section
6.01 or for any other reason,  or (iv) by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender other
than on the last day of the Interest  Period for such Advance upon an assignment
of rights and obligations under this Agreement  pursuant to Section 9.07(a) as a
result of a demand by the Company pursuant to Section 2.17, such Borrower shall,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the
Agent for the  account of such Lender any amounts  required to  compensate  such
Lender for any additional  losses,  costs or expenses that it may reasonably and
actually  incur as a result of such payment or  Conversion,  including,  without
limitation,  any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits),  cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

                  (e) Without  prejudice to the survival of any other  agreement
of any Borrower  hereunder,  the  agreements  and  obligations  of such Borrower
contained in Sections  2.11,  2.14 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of
principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes.

                  SECTION 9.05.  RIGHT OF SET-OFF.  Upon (a) the  occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request
or the granting of the consent  specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent
to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01,
each  Lender is  hereby  authorized  at any time and from  time to time,  to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  to set off and apply  any and all  deposits
(general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final but excluding  trust
accounts)  at any time held and  other  indebtedness  at any time  owing by such
Lender to or for the credit or the account of any  Borrower  against any and all
of the  obligations  of such  Borrower  now or  hereafter  existing  under  this
Agreement and the Note of such Borrower held by such Lender, whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note. Each Lender
agrees  promptly  to notify the  relevant  Borrower  after any such  set-off and
application,  PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and  application.  The rights of each Lender under this
Section  are in  addition  to other  rights  and  remedies  (including,  without
limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.06.  BINDING  EFFECT.  This  Agreement  shall become
effective  (other than Sections 2.01 and 2.03, which shall only become effective
upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it
shall have been  executed  by the Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall
have been notified by each Initial  Lender that such Initial Lender has executed
it and  thereafter  shall be  binding  upon and  inure  to the  benefit  of each
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns,
except that no Borrower  shall have the right to assign its rights  hereunder or
any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

                  SECTION 9.07.  ASSIGNMENTS,  DESIGNATIONS AND  PARTICIPATIONS.
(a) Each Lender may at any time,  and if  demanded  by the  Company  pursuant to
Section 2.17, shall assign to one or more Persons all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement  (including,  without limitation,  all or a
portion of its  Commitment,  the Revolving  Credit  Advances owing to it and the
Revolving  Credit Note or Notes held by it);  provided,  HOWEVER,  that (i) each
such  assignment  shall be of a constant,  and not a varying,  percentage of all
rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (other  than any right to make
Competitive  Bid Advances,  Competitive Bid Advances owing to it and Competitive
Bid  Notes),  (ii)  except  in the  case  of an  assignment  to a  Person  that,
immediately prior to such assignment,  was a Lender or an assignment of all of a
Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of the
Commitment  of the  assigning  Lender  being  assigned  pursuant  to  each  such
assignment  (determined as of the date of the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  with
respect to such assignment)  shall in no event be less than  $10,000,000,  (iii)
each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment
made as a result of a demand by the Company  pursuant  to Section  2.17 shall be
arranged by the Company after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an
assignment of all of the rights and  obligations  of the assigning  Lender under

                                       57
<PAGE>


this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made
concurrently  with  another  such  assignment  or other  such  assignments  that
together cover all of the rights and  obligations of the assigning  Lender under
this Agreement,  (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as
a result of a demand by the Company  pursuant  to Section  2.17 (A) so long as a
Default shall have occurred and be continuing,  (B) unless and until such Lender
shall have  received one or more  payments  from either the  Company,  any other
Borrower or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal
to the  aggregate  outstanding  principal  amount of the Advances  owing to such
Lender,  together with accrued  interest  thereon to the date of payment of such
principal  amount  and all other  amounts  payable  to such  Lender  under  this
Agreement  (including,  but not limited to, any amounts owing under Section 2.11
and  Section  2.14),  and the  Company  shall  have  satisfied  all of its other
obligations  under this Agreement as of the effective date of the assignment and
(C) if any such Eligible  Assignee is not an existing Lender,  the Company shall
have paid to the Agent a  processing  and  recordation  fee of $1,000,  (vi) the
parties to each such assignment  shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with  any  Revolving  Credit  Note  subject  to  such  assignment  and,  if such
assignment  does not occur as a result of a demand by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section  2.17 (in which case the  Company  shall pay the fee  required by clause
(v)(C) of this Section 9.07(a)), a processing and recordation fee of $3,000, and
(vii) in the case of an  assignment  to any  Affiliate  of such  Lender  that is
engaged in the business of commercial  banking,  notice  thereof shall have been
given to the Company and the Agent.  Upon such execution,  delivery,  acceptance
and recording,  from and after the effective  date specified in each  Assignment
and Acceptance,  (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and  obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder  and (y) the Lender  assignor  thereunder  shall,  to the extent  that
rights and  obligations  hereunder  have been  assigned  by it  pursuant to such
Assignment  and  Acceptance,  relinquish  its  rights and be  released  from its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the  case  of an  Assignment  and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender  shall cease to be a party
hereto).

                  (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and  Acceptance,
the Lender assignor  thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each  other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:  (i) other  than as
provided in such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  such  assigning  Lender makes no
representation  or warranty  and assumes no  responsibility  with respect to any
statements,  warranties or  representations  made in or in connection  with this
Agreement or the execution,  legality,  validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,
sufficiency  or value of this  Agreement  or any other  instrument  or  document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility  with respect to the financial  condition
of any Borrower or the  performance  or observance by any Borrower of any of its
obligations  under this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished
pursuant  hereto;  (iii) such  assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement,  together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section  4.01(e),  the most recent financial  statements  referred to in Section
5.01(h) and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
make its own credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into such  Assignment  and
Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit  decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement;  (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible  Assignee;  (vi) such assignee appoints

                                       58
<PAGE>


and  authorizes  the Agent to take such  action  as agent on its  behalf  and to
exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms  hereof,  together  with such  powers and  discretion  as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto;  and (vii) such  assignee  agrees  that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations  that by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance  executed
by an  assigning  Lender and an  assignee  representing  that it is an  Eligible
Assignee,  together  with any  Revolving  Credit  Note or Notes  subject to such
assignment,  the  Agent  shall,  if such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  has  been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto,  (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance,  (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register  and (iii) give prompt  notice  thereof to each  Borrower.  Within five
Business  Days  after its  receipt of such  notice,  each  Borrower,  at its own
expense,  shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered
Revolving  Credit Note of such Borrower a new Revolving Credit Note to the order
of such Eligible  Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment  assumed by such
Eligible  Assignee  pursuant  to such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  and,  if the
assigning  Lender has retained a Commitment  hereunder,  a new Revolving  Credit
Note to the order of the assigning  Lender in an amount equal to the  Commitment
retained  by it  hereunder.  Such  new  Revolving  Credit  Note or  Notes of any
Borrower  shall be in an  aggregate  principal  amount  equal  to the  aggregate
principal  amount  of the  surrendered  Revolving  Credit  Note or Notes of such
Borrower,  shall be dated the effective  date of such  Assignment and Acceptance
and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto.

                  (d) The Agent shall  maintain  at its  address  referred to in
Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance  delivered to and accepted
by it and a  register  for the  recordation  of the names and  addresses  of the
Lenders and the  Commitment  of, and principal  amount of the Advances owing to,
each Lender  from time to time (the  "REGISTER").  The  entries in the  Register
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,  absent  manifest  error,  and
each  Borrower,  the Agent and the Lenders  may treat each Person  whose name is
recorded  in the  Register  as a  Lender  hereunder  for  all  purposes  of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower or any
Lender  at any  reasonable  time and from  time to time  upon  reasonable  prior
notice.

                  (e) Each Lender may sell  participations  to one or more banks
or other  entities  (other than any Borrower or any of its  Affiliates) in or to
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement  (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it
and the Note or Notes held by it);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that (i) such  Lender's
obligations under this Agreement (including,  without limitation, its Commitment
to any Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely  responsible  to the other  parties  hereto for the  performance  of such
obligations,  (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement,  (iv) each Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders
shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection  with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant
under any such  participation  shall have any right to approve any  amendment or

                                       59
<PAGE>

waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement  or any Note,  or any consent to any
departure by any Borrower  therefrom,  except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent  would reduce the  principal  of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,  in each case to the extent subject
to such  participation,  or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal
of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in
each case to the extent subject to such participation.  Each Lender agrees that,
promptly upon selling any such  participation  in  accordance  with this Section
9.07(e), such Lender shall deliver written notice thereof to the Company.

                  (f) Any Lender  may,  in  connection  with any  assignment  or
participation or proposed  assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section
9.07,  disclose  to the  assignee,  or  participant  or  proposed  assignee,  or
participant,  any  information  relating  to the  Company or any other  Borrower
furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower;  PROVIDED that, prior
to any such  disclosure,  the assignee,  or participant or proposed  assignee or
participant  shall agree to preserve  the  confidentiality  of any  Confidential
Information relating to such Borrower received by it from such Lender.

                  (g)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  set forth in this
Agreement,  any Lender may at any time create a security  interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  the
Advances  owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any  Federal
Reserve Bank in  accordance  with  Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

                  SECTION 9.08. DESIGNATED  SUBSIDIARIES.  (a) DESIGNATION.  The
Company  may at any time,  and from time to time,  by delivery to the Agent of a
Designation  Letter duly executed by the Company and the  respective  Subsidiary
and substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto,  designate such Subsidiary as
a "Designated  Subsidiary"  for purposes of this  Agreement and such  Subsidiary
shall thereupon become a "Designated  Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement
and,  as such,  shall  have all of the  rights  and  obligations  of a  Borrower
hereunder.  The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each such designation
by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary.

                  (b)  TERMINATION.  Upon the payment and performance in full of
all of the  indebtedness,  liabilities and obligations  under this Agreement and
the Notes of any Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Notice of
Revolving  Credit Borrowing or Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing in respect of
such  Designated  Subsidiary  is  outstanding,  such  Subsidiary's  status  as a
"Designated  Subsidiary"  shall  terminate  upon  notice to such effect from the
Agent to the  Lenders  (which  notice  the Agent  shall give  promptly  upon its
receipt of a request therefor from the Company).  Thereafter,  the Lenders shall
be under no further  obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated
Subsidiary.

                  SECTION  9.09.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Neither  the  Agent  nor any
Lender shall disclose any  Confidential  Information to any other Person without
the  consent of the  relevant  Borrower,  other than (a) to the  Agent's or such
Lender's   officers,   directors,   employees,   agents  and  advisors  and,  as
contemplated  by  Section  9.07(f),  to  actual  or  prospective  assignees  and

                                       60
<PAGE>

participants,  and  then  only  on a  need-to-know  and  confidential  basis  in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) pursuant to
subpoena or other legal process or as otherwise  required by law (provided  that
the Person making such disclosure shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide
the Company with notice thereof), and (c) as requested or required by any state,
federal or foreign  authority  or examiner  regulating  banks or banking  having
jurisdiction over any Lender.

                  SECTION 9.10.  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement and the Notes
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York.

                  SECTION 9.11. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed  in any  number of  counterparts  and by  different  parties  hereto in
separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original  and all of which  taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
agreement.  Delivery of an  executed  counterpart  of a  signature  page to this
Agreement by  telecopier  shall be effective as delivery of a manually  executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.12.  JURISDICTION,  ETC.  (a)  Each of the  parties
hereto  hereby  irrevocably  and   unconditionally   submits  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction  only of any New York State  court or  federal  court of the United
States of America  sitting in New York City,  and any  appellate  court from any
thereof,  in any  action  or  proceeding  arising  out of or  relating  to  this
Agreement or the Notes, or for  recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and
each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally  agrees that
all  claims  in  respect  of any such  action  or  proceeding  may be heard  and
determined only in any such New York State court or, to the extent  permitted by
law, in such federal court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each of the
parties  hereto  agrees that a final  judgment in any such action or  proceeding
shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each Designated Subsidiary that
has its  principal  place of  business  outside of the United  States of America
hereby  agrees that service of process in any such action or  proceeding  may be
made upon the Company at its offices  specified  in Section  9.02 (the  "PROCESS
AGENT") and each such  Designated  Subsidiary  hereby  irrevocably  appoints the
Process Agent its authorized agent to accept such service of process, and agrees
that the  failure of the  Process  Agent to give any notice of any such  service
shall not  impair or affect the  validity  of such  service  or of any  judgment
rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. Each Borrower hereby further
irrevocably  consents to the service of process in any action or  proceeding  in
such  courts by the  mailing  thereof by any  parties  hereto by  registered  or
certified mail,  postage  prepaid,  to such Borrower at its address set forth in
Section 9.02.  Nothing in this  Agreement  shall affect any right that any party
may otherwise have to serve legal process in any other manner  permitted by law.
To the extent that any  Designated  Subsidiary  has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity  from  jurisdiction  of any  court or from any legal  process  (whether
through service or notice,  attachment  prior to judgment,  attachment in aid of
execution,  execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such
Designated  Subsidiary hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations under this Agreement.

                                       61
<PAGE>


                  (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the Notes
in any New York State or federal court of the United  States of America  sitting
in New York City. Each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives, to the
fullest  extent  permitted by law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

U.S.$_______________                                    Dated: December 10, 1999


                  FOR VALUE RECEIVED,  the  undersigned,  [NAME OF BORROWER],  a
_________________________  corporation (the "BORROWER"),  HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY
to the order of _________________________  (the "LENDER") for the account of its
Applicable  Lending  Office on the Final  Maturity  Date (each as defined in the
Credit  Agreement  referred to below) the principal sum of  U.S.$[amount  of the
Lender's  Commitment in figures] or, if less, the aggregate  principal amount of
the Revolving  Credit Advances (as defined in the Credit  Agreement  referred to
below) made by the Lender to the  Borrower  pursuant to the Amended and Restated
364-Day  Credit  Agreement  dated as of December  10, 1999 among  Hershey  Foods
Corporation, the Lender and certain other lenders party thereto, Citibank, N.A.,
as  administrative  agent (the  "AGENT") for the Lender and such other  lenders,
Nationsbanc  Montgomery  Securities,  Inc., as co-syndication agent, and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc., as co-syndication  agent and arranger (as amended or modified
from time to time, the "CREDIT AGREEMENT";  the terms defined therein being used
herein as therein defined), outstanding on the Final Maturity Date.

                  The Borrower  promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal
amount of each Revolving  Credit Advance from the date of such Revolving  Credit
Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates, and
payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.

                  Both principal and interest are payable in lawful money of the
United States of America to Citibank,  N.A., as Agent, at the Agent's Account in
same day  funds.  Each  Revolving  Credit  Advance  owing to the  Lender  by the
Borrower pursuant to the Credit  Agreement,  and all payments made on account of
principal  thereof,  shall be recorded by the Lender and,  prior to any transfer
hereof,  endorsed on the grid attached  hereto which is part of this  Promissory
Note.

                  This  Promissory  Note is one of the  Revolving  Credit  Notes
referred to in, and is entitled to the  benefits of, the Credit  Agreement.  The
Credit Agreement,  among other things,  (i) provides for the making of Revolving
Credit  Advances  by the  Lender  to the  Borrower  and  each  other  "Borrower"
thereunder  from time to time in an  aggregate  amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the U.S. dollar amount first above  mentioned,  the  indebtedness of
the Borrower  resulting from each such Revolving  Credit Advance being evidenced
by this Promissory Note, and (ii) contains provisions in Sections 6.01 and 2.10,
respectively,  for  acceleration  of the maturity  hereof upon the  happening of
certain stated events and also for  prepayments  on account of principal  hereof
prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified.

                   The Borrower hereby waives presentment,  demand,  protest and
notice of any kind.  No failure to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any
rights  hereunder on the part of the holder  hereof shall operate as a waiver of
such rights.

         Subsidiary  enforceable against the Designated Subsidiary in accordance
         with their  respective terms except to the extent that such enforcement
         may be limited by applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency and other similar

         investigation,  litigation or proceeding including, without limitation,
         any Environmental Action, affecting the Designated Subsidiary or any of

         that (i) could be reasonably  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,
         or (ii) purports to effect the legality,  validity or enforceability of
         this  Designation  Letter,  the  Credit  Agreement,  any  Note  of  the
         Designated   Subsidiary  or  the   consummation  of  the   transactions
         contemplated thereby.

                  5. No  authorization  or approval  or other  action by, and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental  authority or administrative

         effect.

To each of the Lenders party
  to the Credit Agreement referred

  to below and to Citibank, N.A., as
  Agent for such Lenders

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  This   opinion  is   furnished  to  you  pursuant  to  Section
3.01(g)(iv) of the Amended and Restated  364-Day Credit  Agreement,  dated as of
December 10, 1999 (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), among Hershey Foods Corporation (the
"COMPANY"),  the Lenders party thereto,  Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent
(the  "AGENT") for said Lenders,  Nationsbanc  Montgomery  Securities,  Inc., as
co-syndication agent, and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., as co-syndication agent and
arranger.  Terms  defined in the  Credit  Agreement  are used  herein as therein
defined.

                  I am the Senior  Vice  President  and  General  Counsel of the
Company,  and I have acted as counsel  for the  Company in  connection  with the
preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

                  In that connection, I have examined:

                  (1)   the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes
             of the Company;

                  (2)   the documents furnished by the Company pursuant to
             Article III of the Credit Agreement;

                  (3)   the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
             the Company and all amendments thereto (the "CHARTER"); and


                  (4)   The by-laws of the Company and all amendments thereto
            (the "BY-LAWS").
<PAGE>



                  I have also examined the originals,  or copies certified to my
satisfaction,  of such other corporate  records of the Company,  certificates of
public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and
other  documents,  as I have  deemed  necessary  as a  basis  for  the  opinions
expressed below. In making such examinations,  I have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures (other than those on behalf of the Company),  the authenticity of
all  documents  submitted to me as  originals  and the  conformity  to authentic
original documents of all documents  submitted to me as certified,  conformed or
photographic  copies. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have,
when  relevant  facts were not  independently  established  by me,  relied  upon
certificates  of the Company or its  officers or of public  officials  and as to
questions of fact and law, on opinions or statements by other lawyers  reporting
to  me.  I  have  assumed  the  due  execution  and  delivery,  pursuant  to due
authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders and the Agent.

                  My  opinions  expressed  below are  limited  to the law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, where applicable, the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States.

                  Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have
deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:

                  1.  The  Company  is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

                  2. The execution,  delivery and  performance by the Company of
         the  Credit  Agreement  and  the  Notes,  and the  consummation  of the
         transactions  contemplated  thereby, are within the Company's corporate
         powers,  have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate  action,
         and do not  contravene  (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law,
         rule  or  regulation  applicable  to the  Company  (including,  without
         limitation,  Regulation  X of the  Board of  Governors  of the  Federal
         Reserve System) or (iii) any contractual or legal  restriction  binding
         on or affecting the Company or, to the best of my knowledge,  contained
         in any other similar document,  except where such  contravention  would
         not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Credit
         Agreement and the Revolving  Credit Notes of the Company have been duly
         executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.

                  3. No  authorization,  approval  or other  action  by,  and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required  for the due  execution,  delivery
         and  performance by the Company of the Credit  Agreement and the Notes,
         or for  the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  thereby,
         except for the authorizations,  approvals, actions, notices and filings
         (i) listed on Schedule  4.01(c) to the Credit  Agreement,  all of which
         have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and are in full force and
         effect and (ii) where the  Company's  failure to receive,  take or make
         such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing would not have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  4. There (i) are no pending  or, to the best of my  knowledge,
         threatened actions, investigations,  litigations or proceedings against
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  before any court,  governmental
         agency  or  arbitrator  that (a) would be  reasonably  likely to have a
         Material  Adverse  Effect (other than the Disclosed  Litigation) or (b)
         purport  to  affect  the   legality,   validity,   binding   effect  or
         enforceability  of the  Credit  Agreement  or any of the  Notes  or the
         consummation of the transactions  contemplated  thereby, and (ii) there
         has been no adverse  change in the status,  or financial  effect on the
         Company  and  its  Subsidiaries  taken  as a  whole,  of the  Disclosed
         Litigation from that described on Schedule 3.01(b) thereto.

                  This  opinion  letter  may  be  relied  upon  by you  only  in
connection  with  the  transaction  being  consummated  pursuant  to the  Credit
Agreement  and may not be used or relied upon by any other  person for any other
purpose.

                                                Very truly yours,

                         OF SIMPSON, THACHER & BARTLETT,
                            SPECIAL NEW YORK COUNSEL

                                 TO THE COMPANY

                   [Letterhead of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett]

To each of the Lenders listed on
         Schedule I hereto and to Citibank,
         N.A., as Agent for such Lenders

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  We have acted as  special  New York  counsel to Hershey  Foods
Corporation  (the "COMPANY") in connection with the  preparation,  execution and
delivery of the Amended  and  Restated  364-Day  Credit  Agreement,  dated as of
December 10, 1999 (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), among the Company, the Lenders party
thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "AGENT") for said Lenders,
and Nationsbanc  Montgomery  Securities,  Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., as
co-syndication agents.

                  This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(g)(v)
of the Five-Year Credit Agreement. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein are used herein as therein defined.

                  In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or
copies,  certified or otherwise  identified to our  satisfaction,  of the Credit
Agreement  and the  Revolving  Credit  Notes and the opinion of Robert M. Reese,
Vice President and General  Counsel of the Company (the "COMPANY  OPINION").  In
addition,  we  have  examined  originals  or  copies,   certified  or  otherwise
identified  to our  satisfaction,  of such  corporate  records  of the  Company,
certificates of public  officials and of officers of the Company and agreements,
instruments and other documents, and have made such other investigations,  as we
have deemed  relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions  hereinafter set
forth.

                  For  the  purposes   hereof,   we  have  assumed,   with  your
permission,  the  genuineness of all  signatures,  the legal capacity of natural
persons and the authenticity and regularity of all documents  examined by us. As
to questions of fact relevant to this opinion,  we have relied upon,  and assume
the  accuracy  of,  certificates  and  oral  or  written  statements  and  other
information  of the  Company  or of its  officers  or of  public  officials  and
representations  and warranties of the Company set forth in the Credit Agreement
and assume  compliance on the part of all parties to the Credit  Agreement  with
their  covenants  and  agreements  contained  therein.  We have  assumed the due
execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization,  of each of the documents
referred to above by all parties thereto.
<PAGE>


                  Based on and  subject  to the  foregoing,  and  subject to the
qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:


                  1. The execution,  delivery and  performance by the Company of
the  Credit  Agreement  and  the  Notes,  and  the  borrowings  by  the  Company
thereunder,  do not  violate  any  present  Federal  or New  York  law,  rule or
regulation  known by us to be  applicable  to the  Company  (including,  without
limitation,  Regulation  X of the  Board of  Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve
System).

                  2. No  authorization,  approval  or other  action  by,  and no
notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body pursuant
to  any  present  Federal  or  New  York  law or  regulation  known  by us to be
applicable  to the  Company is  required  for the due  execution,  delivery  and
performance  by the Company of the Credit  Agreement  and the Notes,  or for the
borrowings of the Company thereunder.

                  3. The Credit  Agreement and the Revolving  Credit Notes dated
and  delivered as of the date hereof are, and the other Notes when  executed and
delivered  under  the  Credit  Agreement  will  be,  legal,  valid  and  binding
obligations of the Company  enforceable  against the Company in accordance  with
their respective terms.

                  Our opinions set forth in paragraph 3 above are subject to the
effects of  bankruptcy,  insolvency  (including,  without  limitation,  all laws
relating to fraudulent  transfers),  reorganization,  moratorium or similar laws
relating to or affecting  creditors' rights generally and general  principles of
equity  (whether  considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

                  With your permission, we do not express any opinion as to:

                  (a) the effect of the law of any  jurisdiction  other than the
         State  of New  York  wherein  any  Lender  may be  located  or  wherein
         enforcement  of the Credit  Agreement  or the Notes may be sought  that
         limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or enforceable.

                  (b) any  indemnification  obligations of the Company under the
         Credit Agreement to the extent such  obligations  might be deemed to be
         inconsistent with public policy.

                  (c) any  provision of the Credit  Agreement  that  purports to
        establish an evidentiary  standard for  determinations by the Lenders or
        the Agent.

                  We are  members of the Bar of the State of New York and do not
purport to be experts on, or to express any opinions herein concerning,  any law
other  than the laws of the State of New York,  the  federal  laws of the United
States of America and the General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  To
the extent that our opinions expressed herein involve  conclusions as to matters
set  forth  in  the  Company  Opinion,   we  have  assumed  without  independent
investigation  the correctness of the matters set forth in the Company  Opinion,
<PAGE>

our opinions being subject to the  assumptions,  qualifications  and limitations
set forth in the Company Opinion with respect thereto.

                 This  opinion is  rendered  only to you and is solely for your
benefit in connection  with the execution and delivery of the Credit  Agreement.
This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon
by or furnished  to any other  person,  firm,  or  corporation  for any purpose,
without our prior written  consent,  except that a copy may be furnished to, but
not relied upon by, an Eligible  Assignee which is a prospective  assignee under
the Credit Agreement.

                                              Very truly yours,

                     EXHIBIT I - FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL
                           TO A DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARY

[Date]


To each of the Lenders party
     to the Credit Agreement
     referred to below,
     and to Citibank, N.A., as Agent
     for said Lenders


Ladies and Gentlemen:

                 In my capacity as counsel to _____________________ ("DESIGNATED
SUBSIDIARY"),  I have reviewed that certain Amended and Restated  364-Day Credit
Agreement, dated as of December 10, 1999 (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), among Hershey
Foods Corporation (the "COMPANY"), the Lenders party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as
administrative  agent (the  "AGENT") for said  Lenders,  Nationsbanc  Montgomery
Securities,  Inc., as  co-syndication  agent,  and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., as
co-syndication  agent and arranger.  Terms  defined in the Credit  Agreement are
used herein as therein defined.  In connection  therewith,  I have also examined
the following documents:

                  (i)    The Designation Letter (as defined in the Credit
         Agreement) executed by the Designated Subsidiary.

                  [such other documents as counsel may wish to refer to]


                  I have also  reviewed  such  matters of law and  examined  the
original,  certified,  conformed or photographic copies of such other documents,
records, agreements and certificates as I have considered relevant hereto. As to
questions of fact material to such opinions,  we have,  when relevant facts were
not independently  established by us, relied upon certificates of the Designated
Subsidiary or of its officers or of public officials and as to questions of fact
and law, on opinions or  statements  by other  lawyers  reporting  to me. I have
assumed (i) the due execution and delivery,  pursuant to due  authorization,  of
each of the  documents  referred to above by all parties  thereto other than the
Designated Subsidiary,  (ii) the authenticity of all such documents submitted to
us as originals  and (iii) the  conformity  to  originals of all such  documents
submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies.

                  My opinions  expressed  below are limited to  ________________
and the State of New York.

<PAGE>

                  Based upon the  foregoing,  and upon such  investigation  as I
have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:

                  1.  The  Designated  Subsidiary  (a)  is  a  corporation  duly
         incorporated,  validly  existing and in good standing under the laws of
         _________________________,   (b)  is  duly   qualified  in  each  other
         jurisdiction  in  which it owns or  leases  property  or in  which  the
         conduct of its  business  requires it to so qualify or be licensed  and
         (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and
         operate its  properties  and to carry on its business as now  conducted
         and as proposed to be conducted.

                  2. The execution,  delivery and  performance by the Designated
         Subsidiary  of its  Designation  Letter,  the Credit  Agreement and its
         Revolving  Credit  Notes,  and  the  consummation  of the  transactions
         contemplated thereby, are within the Designated  Subsidiary's corporate
         powers,  have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate  action,
         and do not  contravene  (i) any  provision of the charter or by-laws or
         other constituent documents of the Designated Subsidiary, (ii) any law,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Designated Subsidiary or (iii) any
         contractual or legal obligation or restriction  binding on or affecting
         the Designated Subsidiary, except where such contravention would not be
         reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect.  The Designation
         Letter and each Revolving Credit Note of the Designated  Subsidiary has
         been  duly  executed  and   delivered  on  behalf  of  the   Designated
         Subsidiary.

                  3. The Designation  Letter of the Designated  Subsidiary,  the
         Credit  Agreement  and the  Revolving  Credit  Notes of the  Designated
         Subsidiary  are, and each other Note of the Designated  Subsidiary when
         executed and delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, legal, valid
         and binding  obligations  of the Designated  Subsidiary  enforceable in
         accordance with their respective  terms,  except as the  enforceability
         thereof may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization  or
         moratorium  or  other  similar  laws  relating  to the  enforcement  of
         creditors' rights generally or by the application of general principles
         of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
         proceeding  in equity or at law),  and except that I express no opinion
         as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Courts of the
         United States of America to adjudicate any controversy  relating to the
         Credit Agreement,  the Designation Letter of the Designated  Subsidiary
         or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary or (ii) the effect of the law
         of any  jurisdiction  (other  than the State of New York)  wherein  any
         Lender  or  Applicable   Lending  Office  may  be  located  or  wherein
         enforcement  of the Credit  Agreement,  the  Designation  Letter of the
         Designated  Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary may be
         sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected
         by such Lender.

                  4.  There  is no  pending,  or to the  best  of my  knowledge,
         threatened action, investigation, litigation or proceeding at law or in
         equity against the Designated Subsidiary before any court, governmental
         agency or arbitrator that would be reasonably likely to have a Material
         Adverse  Effect or that  purports  to affect  the  legality,  validity,
         binding  effect  or  enforceability  of the  Designation  Letter of the
         Designated  Subsidiary,  the Credit  Agreement or any Revolving  Credit
<PAGE>

         Note  of  the  Designated  Subsidiary,   or  the  consummation  of  the
         transactions contemplated thereby.

                  5.  No  authorization, approval  or other  action  by,  and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required  for the due  execution,  delivery
         and performance by the Designated Subsidiary of its Designation Letter,
         the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Designated  Subsidiary  except
         for such  authorizations,  consents,  approvals,  actions,  notices  or
         filings as have heretofore  been made,  obtained or affected and are in
         full force and effect.

                  This  opinion  letter  may  be  relied  upon  by you  only  in
connection  with  the  transaction  being  consummated  pursuant  to the  Credit
Agreement  and may not be used or relied upon by any other  person for any other
purpose.

                                             Very truly yours,

<PAGE>

         While the exclusive grant of trademark  license  relating to Trademarks
became effective in the Territory on the Original  Effective Date, the exclusive
grant of trademark  license  relating to Trademarks  shall become effective on a
global basis on the Effective  Date with the  exception of trademarks  and trade
dress  associated  with "Jolly  Rancher" and "Milkduds"  and any  modifications,
variations or extensions  thereof,  which shall become effective on an exclusive
basis outside of the Territory on September 30, 2000 being non-exclusive outside
of the Territory  from the Effective Date through  September 30, 2000.  From the
Effective  Date  through  September  30,  2000,  the  Licensee  shall retain its
exclusive (even as to Licensor and its Affiliates) authority,  right and license
to produce, market,  advertise,  promote, sell, distribute or offer for sale the
Products  under the  Trademarks in the  Territory  and to use the  Trademarks as
trade names in connection therewith under the Original Agreement.

         2.2  CONSIDERATION.  In consideration  for the right and license herein
granted to the Licensee to use the Trademarks in connection with the Products on
a global basis,  the Licensee  agrees (i) to pay to the Licensor or its assignee
an  amount  of  Five  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  (USD$500,000)  payable  in one
installment  on the  Effective  Date  in  immediately  available  funds  by wire
transfer  to an  account  designated  by the  Licensor  and  (ii) to  convey  to
Licensor,  as of the  Effective  Date,  all of its right and  license to use the
trademark  "XyliFresh" together with its exclusive right to use in the Territory
all  Patent  Rights  and  Technical   Information   related  thereto,   and  any
modifications,  variations  or  extensions  thereof,  and  all of its  trademark
registrations  and applications  therefor,  and Licensee shall cancel all of its
security  interests  related thereto.  As of the Effective Date,  Licensee shall
cease any and all use of the  XyliFresh  trademark  and trade dress  (subject to
Licensee's  right to dispose of inventory on hand as of the Effective Date), and
its  right  to use  any  Patent  Rights  and  Technical  Information  associated
therewith,  provided,  however,  that nothing herein shall prevent Licensee from
using any Patent Rights and/or Technical Information associated with any Product
produced, marketed, advertised,  promoted, sold, distributed or offered for sale
by Licensee or any sublicensed Affiliate of Licensee prior to the Effective Date
with respect to which any Patent Right and/or Technical  Information  associated
with  XyliFresh  was  used  ("XyliFresh  Technical  Information")  (but  no such
Technical  Information relating solely and specifically to the use of Xylitol as
a  sweetener  in chewing  gum) and with the signing of this  Agreement  Licensee
<PAGE>


shall  receive  a   non-exclusive   license  to  use  any  XyliFresh   Technical
Information.

         2.3.  GOODWILL.  The use of the Trademarks by  Licensee  and any of its
sublicensees  and the  goodwill associated therewith shall enure solely to the
benefit of the Licensor.

         2.4.  EXPANSION OF TRADEMARK USE BY LICENSEE.  The Licensee  shall have
the absolute and unconditional right, subject only to the limitations imposed by
any of the license or limitations  agreements  referred to on SCHEDULE A, to use
in any  jurisdiction  anywhere in the world any of the  Trademarks in any way in
connection with the manufacturing,  marketing, advertising,  promoting, selling,
distributing or offering for sale of any product or service in addition to those
specified in SECTION 1.1.(H)(I).  In the event of such use of a Trademark,  such
product or service shall  thereupon  become a Product as provided for in SECTION
1.1.(H)(II)  and be  subject  to the terms  and  conditions  of this  Agreement,
including but not limited to ARTICLE 4 AND 5 HEREOF,  but only when such product
or service bears or has a Trademark  used in connection  with it and solely with
respect to the  jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which such use of the Trademark
occurs.

         2.5.  GRANT OF  LICENSE TO  TECHNICAL  INFORMATION  AND PATENT  RIGHTS.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  Licensor (for itself and
its  Affiliates)  hereby  grants to  Licensee,  to the  extent  Licensor  or its
Affiliates  have the right to do so, an exclusive  license  (even as to Licensor
and its Affiliates) to use the Technical  Information and the Patent Rights on a
global  basis  without  restriction  as to  use  thereof  by  Licensee  and  its
Affiliates in the conduct of any and all aspects of their respective businesses.
To the extent necessary,  Licensor agrees to obtain, at its expense,  for use by
Licensee the aforesaid rights from Licensor's Affiliates.  Licensee shall at its
expense maintain the Patent Rights.

         While the exclusive  license to use the Technical  Information  and the
Patent Rights in the Territory became effective on the Original  Effective Date,
the exclusive  license to use the Technical  Information  and Patent Rights on a
global  basis  shall  become  effective  on July 1, 1999 with the  exception  of
Technical  Information  and Patent Rights  associated  with "Jolly  Rancher" and
"Milkduds",  which shall become effective on an exclusive basis on September 30,
2000  being  non-exclusive  outside of the  Territory  from the  Effective  Date


<PAGE>

through September 30, 2000.

         2.6.  TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE.  (a)  During  the term of this  Agreement,
Licensor and its Affiliates  shall,  upon the reasonable  request of Licensee or
its  Affiliates,  and  subject  to  the  availability  of  personnel  and  other
resources,  make available to Licensee and its Affiliates the technical services
of  Licensor's  and  its  Affiliates'  personnel  to  advise  Licensee  and  its
Affiliates in the manufacture and marketing of the Products.

         (b) Included in such technical services shall be the following:
                  (i)     technical  instruction and consulting with Licensee's
                          and its Affiliates' personnel with regard to
                          manufacturing the Products;

                 (ii)     inspections and visits; and

                (iii)     qualitative analysis.

                  (c)  Technical  assistance  shall  also  include,  but  is not
limited  to,  communicating  information,  advice and  proposals  with regard to
details of the manufacturing  processes and techniques for the Products,  advice
as to premises, purchase of machinery,  installation of machinery,  conditioning
of  premises,   warehousing,   purchasing  of  raw  materials,   transportation,
packaging, shelf life, quality assurance and the like.

         2.7. CONTINUED USE OF PATENT RIGHTS AND TECHNICAL  INFORMATION.  In the
event of any termination of this  Agreement,  Licensee's  rights  hereunder with
respect to the Patent Rights and Technical  Information  shall  continue in full
force and effect and shall not be impaired or diminished, except that Licensee's
rights with respect to the use of the Patent  Rights and  Technical  Information
shall thereafter become non-exclusive.

         2.8.  NO  INFRINGEMENT.   Licensor  (for  itself  and  its  Affiliates)
represents  and  warrants  that the  Technical  Information  and  Patent  Rights
comprise all such  information and patents used heretofore by Licensor or any of
its  pre-Original  Effective Date Affiliates in connection with the development,
production, manufacture,  distribution and sale of the Products in the Territory
<PAGE>

and that to its  knowledge the  Technical  Information  and Patent Rights do not
infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

         2.9.  BANKRUPTCY  OR  INSOLVENCY. (a) The rights  granted  to  Licensee
and its Affiliates  under this  Agreement are, and shall  otherwise be deemed to
be, for the  purposes of Section  365(n) of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  a license of
"intellectual  property" rights as defined in Section 101(35A) of the Bankruptcy
Code.
         Licensee,  as  licensee  of  rights  under  this  Agreement,  may fully
exercise all of its rights for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates  under the
Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, Licensee's rights to continue to
exercise its rights licensed hereunder.

         (b)  Licensor  hereby  grants to  Licensee  a first  priority  security
interest in the Trademarks,  Patent Rights and Technical  Information,  together
with all good will associated  therewith,  to secure  performance by Licensor of
its  obligations  under this  Agreement.  Licensor  shall  cooperate  and assist
Licensee with the execution and filing of all documents necessary to perfect and
record such grant of  security  interest on a global  basis,  including  without
limitation, filings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, all of the
expenses associated therewith being for the account of Licensee. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  no security  interest is granted  under this  Agreement  in any
Trademark, Patent Right or Technical Information where such grant would harm the
validity of any such Trademark, Patent Right or Technical Information.  Licensee
agrees that it will,  at its expense,  terminate  all security  interests in the
Trademarks,  if  this  Agreement  is  terminated  by  Licensee  pursuant  to the
provisions  of SECTION 7.1 or if this  Agreement is  terminated  pursuant to the
provisions of SECTION  8.1(B).  Licensee  further  agrees that in the event this
Agreement  and the  Trademarks,  Patent  Rights and  Technical  Information  are
assigned by Licensor  pursuant to the provisions of SECTION 10.3,  Licensee will
release its security interest vis-a-vis Licensor provided that Licensor and such
assignee have previously  taken all reasonable  steps  necessary,  at Licensee's
expense,  to put  Licensee  in the same  secured  position  with  respect to the
Trademarks,  Patent Rights and Technical Information as Licensee was in prior to
any such assignment and Licensee further agrees to cooperate and assist Licensor
and such assignee in that regard.

                          SCHEDULE A with respect thereto and the rights therein
                          have not been abandoned.

         3.2. NOTICE OF INFRINGEMENT  AND PROTECTION OF TRADEMARKS.  Each of the
parties  hereto agrees to give the other party  written  notice of any actual or
threatened  infringement  of the  Trademarks  by a third party,  promptly  after
information with respect to such infringement or threatened  infringement  comes
to its attention. Licensee is hereby given the right, but not the obligation, to
bring suit or take other action to eliminate  such  infringement  or  threatened
infringement  at its own expense in the name of itself,  Licensor or both itself
and Licensor, provided that Licensee shall provide prior notice to Licensor when
bringing  suit or taking other action in the name of Licensor or both itself and
Licensor,  and provided  further that Licensee  shall notify  Licensor  promptly
after  bringing suit or taking other action in its own name.  Licensee shall not
obligate Licensor for, or shall indemnify Licensor against, any costs, expenses,
attorneys'  fees or other  obligations  in  connection  with any such  action or
proceeding.  Further,  Licensor  shall  cooperate  with  Licensee at  Licensee's
expense in connection with any such action or proceeding.  Any damages recovered
in any such  action  or  proceeding,  less all court  costs and other  expenses,
including  expenses incurred by Licensor,  shall be for the account of Licensee.
If, after learning of an infringement of the Trademarks, Licensee chooses not to
bring suit  against  such  infringer  or take  other  action to  eliminate  such
infringement or threatened  infringement,  Licensor shall have the right but not
the  obligation to bring an action against such infringer at its own expense and
any final award or settlement  resulting  therefrom  shall be for the account of
Licensor.

         3.3.  MAINTENANCE OF TRADEMARKS.  Licensee,  at its own expense,  shall
have primary  responsibility  for the  maintenance of all  registrations  of the
Trademarks  on a global basis,  and shall pursue any  currently  pending and any
future  applications  for  registration  therefor  (and  shall have the right to
pursue  registration of any trademark  identical to a Trademark in jurisdictions
within the  Territory  where such  registration  does not exist on the  Original
Effective Date or outside the Territory on the Effective Date), on behalf of the
Licensor,  and,  in the  service  thereof,  shall  provide  Licensor  with  such
documentation as may be necessary to permit Licensor to execute any applications
for  registrations  and  renewals  as may be  necessary  with  respect  to  such
<PAGE>

Trademarks (or  trademarks) in the name of Licensor.  If the Licensor shall fail
to take any action appropriately requested by Licensee to maintain or register a
Trademark  (or  trademark  identical  to a  Trademark  as  provided  for above),
Licensee may,  after  written  notice to Licensor,  register such  Trademark (or
trademark) in its own name and thereafter  promptly assign such  registration to
Licensor.  The parties  agree to  cooperate in obtaining  and  maintaining  such
registrations,  renewals and assignments,  if any. All trademark rights obtained
in accordance  with the provisions of this SECTION 3.3 shall be included  within
the license grant of SECTION 2.1 immediately  upon such  acquisition and without
the  requirement of any further  action by Licensor or Licensee;  and SCHEDULE A
hereto shall be supplemented accordingly.

         3.4.  MODIFICATION  OF TRADEMARKS AND TRADE DRESS.  Licensee shall have
the right to modify the format of the Trademarks and the Trade Dress  associated
therewith  if in its  reasonable  business  judgment  it  determines  that  such
modifications are necessary or desirable.  Any such modified Trademarks shall be
owned by Licensor and shall be included  within the license grant of SECTION 2.1
and shall be considered a Trademark under this Agreement without the requirement
of any notice to or further action by Licensor or Licensee and SCHEDULE A hereto
shall be  supplemented  accordingly.  Licensee  shall  have the  right to pursue
registration  in Licensor's  name of any such  modified  Trademark in accordance
with SECTION 3.3.

                              STANDARDS OF QUALITY

         4.1.  WARRANTY AS TO PRODUCTS.  Licensee  warrants to Licensor that the
Products in connection  with which the Trademarks are used shall,  at all times,
conform to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and shall conform in all material
respects with all laws and  regulations  applicable.  Products will be produced,
packaged,  advertised  and  distributed  consistent  with the quality  standards
applied  prior  to  the  Original  Effective  Date  by  Licensor  or  any of its
pre-Original  Effective  Date  Affiliates  to the Products in the  Territory and
consistent  with the quality  standards  applied prior to the Effective  Date by
Licensor or any of its pre-Effective Date Affiliates to the products outside the
Territory.  Any new  Products  introduced  in the  Territory  after the Original
<PAGE>

Effective Date or introduced  outside of the Territory  after the Effective Date
shall also be produced and packaged  consistent  respectively  with such quality
standards.  In the case of new Products  which are not  confectionery  products,
such Products shall be produced consistent with the quality standards applied by
reputable manufacturers of such products.

         4.2. INSPECTIONS AND SAMPLES. Licensee agrees that Licensor or its duly
authorized  agent  (PROVIDED  that  Licensor or such agent shall have executed a
confidentiality  agreement  reasonably  satisfactory to Licensee) shall have the
right,  on an annual basis at a time to be agreed upon by Licensor and Licensee,
to inspect the manufacturing process utilized to produce the Products under this
Agreement to ensure compliance with the quality standards set forth herein.  The
inspection  shall be limited to those areas of the facilities where the Products
are  manufactured,  and  the  Licensor  agrees  to  such  restrictions  on  such
inspections  as may be required under the  Licensee's  contractual  arrangements
with third parties.  During such inspections,  (i) review may be made of quality
control and manufacturing reports as may be reasonably requested,  (ii) Licensor
or its duly  authorized  agent may take a  reasonable  number of  representative
samples of the Products for quality audit  purposes,  and (iii)  Licensor or its
duly  authorized  agent  may  review  representative   samples  of  promotional,
marketing and point-of-sale  materials for the Products illustrating  Licensee's
use of the Trademarks.

                              PROMOTION OF PRODUCTS

         5.1. BEST  EFFORTS.  Licensee  shall use its best efforts  commercially
reasonable in the  circumstances  and consistent with  Licensee's  marketing and
sales promotion practices to market and promote the sale and distribution of the
Products  under the  Trademarks in North  America.  It is understood  and agreed
between  the  parties  that  Licensee's  obligation  pursuant  to the  foregoing
sentence  shall not limit  Licensee's  ability  to curtail  or  discontinue  the
marketing,  promotion or sale of Products,  provided Licensee determines that it
is  commercially  reasonable  to do so based on the same  criteria it employs in
connection with the curtailment or discontinuance of the marketing, promotion or
sale of its own confectionery products.

                                    ROYALTIES

         6.1.  PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES.  In  consideration of the right and license
herein  granted to the Licensee to use the  Trademarks  in  connection  with the
Products,  the Licensee agrees to pay to the Licensor, or to such other party as
the Licensor may  hereafter  direct to Licensee in writing,  the  royalties  set
forth in SECTION 6.2 hereof in the  amounts and manner set forth  therein and in
SECTION 6.4.

         6.2. ROYALTY PAYMENTS.

                  (a)      Licensee shall pay an annual royalty as follows:

                           (i)     [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED]  for a
                                   period  commencing  on the  Original
                                   Effective Date through the tenth (10th)
                                   anniversary  of the Original  Effective
                                   Date;

                          (ii)     [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED] from the
                                   tenth  (10th)  anniversary  of  the  Original
                                   Effective  Date through the twentieth  (20th)
                                   anniversary of the Original  Effective  Date;
                                   and

                         (iii)     [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED] from the
                                   twentieth (20th)  anniversary of the Original
                                   Effective  Date  until  the   termination  or
                                   expiration of this Agreement.

                  (b) In each  Annual  Period  hereunder,  Licensee  shall  make
quarterly  royalty  payments to Licensor  covering Net Sales  during  Licensee's
accounting  quarter  no later than forty five (45) days after the end of each of
the  first  three  accounting  quarters  and sixty  (60)  days  after the end of
Licensee's fourth accounting  quarter.  The royalty payment for Net Sales during
Licensee's fourth  accounting  quarter shall be adjusted to properly reflect Net
Sales  for the  Annual  Period  and for  purposes  of the  first  Annual  Period
hereunder  (the period  ending on  December  31,  1999) shall take into  account
<PAGE>

royalty  payments for Net Sales made or to be made under the Original  Agreement
for the  period  from  January  1, 1999 to the  Effective  Date.  To the  extent
permitted under applicable United States  securities laws,  Licensee agrees that
in December  (following the  completion of the  Licensee's  and its  sublicensed
Affiliates'  annual  marketing  plans for the Products for the following  fiscal
year) of each year it will advise  Licensor of the amount of Licensee's  and its
sublicensed  Affiliates' planned aggregate sales of the Products for such fiscal
year and Licensor agrees to treat such information confidentially.

         (c) [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]

         6.3. PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES;  WITHHOLDING TAXES. All royalty and interest
payments shall be made in United States dollars.  Royalties not paid by Licensee
by the date specified in SECTION 6.2 shall bear interest from the date specified
for payment  herein until  actually  paid at an interest rate equal to the prime
lending  rate  quoted  and in effect  from  time to time by The Chase  Manhattan
Corporation or its successor. All royalty payments which are required to be made
hereunder by the Licensee to the Licensor shall be made in immediately available
funds at a bank  designated  by the  Licensor  from  time to time.  All  royalty
payments shall be subject to any applicable taxes, if any, which are required to
be withheld,  PROVIDED that the same are forthwith remitted and evidence of such
remittance to the appropriate  taxing authority is provided to the Licensor upon
request.

         6.4.  RECORDS  AND  REPORTS.  At all  times  during  the  Term  of this
Agreement,  Licensee shall (in accordance  with its customary  record  retention
policy)  keep true,  accurate and complete  records of total  quantities  of the
Products sold and the Net Sales in sufficient detail to permit the determination
of  royalties  payable  in  respect  thereof.  At the time  Licensee  makes  its
quarterly  payment of royalties  pursuant to SECTION 6.2, Licensee shall provide
Licensor with a royalty  report for such quarter as to the royalty  payments due
for that quarter.  The royalty report shall state, in reasonable detail, (a) the
Net Sales for each Product, (b) total Net Sales, and (c) the amount of royalties
due for such  quarter.  At the request and expense of Licensor,  Licensee  shall
permit an independent public accountant  selected by Licensor to have access to,
examine  and,  with  the  consent  of  Licensee  (which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably withheld),  copy during ordinary business hours such books, records
<PAGE>

and  accounts as may be necessary  or  advisable  to enable such  accountant  to
verify or  determine  the  royalty  paid or  payable  under this  Agreement  and
Licensee  shall render all  reasonable  assistance  to such  accountant  in that
regard.

         6.5. NO RELIEF.  Nothing  stated in this Article 6 shall relieve the
Licensee from making payments to the Licensor pursuant to the Original Agreement
in respect of periods preceding the Effective Date.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                                      TERM

         7.1. TERM. This Agreement shall have an initial term of seven years and
six months  commencing on the Effective  Date at which time it shall replace the
Original Agreement.  Thereafter,  this Agreement shall be renewed  automatically
without any prior notice to or action by either party or any of their respective
Affiliates,  successors  or assigns for  periods of ten (10) years each,  unless
terminated  (i)  by  Licensee  at  the  end of the  first  renewal  term  or any
subsequent  ten (10) year  renewal  term on not less than six (6)  months  prior
notice to Licensor,  or (ii) pursuant to the provisions of SECTION 8.1 (B). Upon
any such  termination,  all of the  Trademarks  shall remain the property of the
Licensor and no rights therein shall be deemed transferred to the Licensee,  and
Licensee  shall  immediately  cease  all  use  of  the  Trademarks,  subject  to
Licensee's right to dispose of inventory on hand as of the date of termination.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                               REMEDIES FOR BREACH

         8.1. BREACH OF PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS BY LICENSEE.

         (a)  Licensor  acknowledges  and agrees  that it shall have no right to
terminate  this  Agreement  or any of  Licensee's  rights  hereunder  except  as
expressly set forth in this SECTION 8.1.

         (b) In the  event  of a  willful  breach  by  Licensee  of its  payment
obligations pursuant to ARTICLE 6 hereof,  Licensor may send a written notice to
Licensee  stating that it has breached its payment  obligations,  specifying  in
detail the nature of such breach and requiring  Licensee to rectify such breach.
<PAGE>

If such breach is not rectified by Licensee  within a period of thirty (30) days
after  receiving  written  notice from  Licensor,  Licensor shall be entitled to
exercise  any  remedies it may have  hereunder,  including  termination  of this
Agreement.

         (c)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of Section  8.1(b),  in the event
Licensee  disputes in good faith the alleged  breach by disputing  the amount of
royalties owed by Licensee pursuant to SECTION 6.2 hereof, such dispute shall be
resolved  exclusively by  arbitration  pursuant to SECTION 8.3 and in accordance
with the  procedures  set forth therein,  and shall,  in no event,  give rise to
Licensor's  ability to terminate this Agreement.  Such arbitration  shall be the
sole and exclusive dispute  resolution  mechanism for resolving such matter, the
parties  hereto   voluntarily   waiving  for  themselves  and  their  respective
Affiliates any other rights or remedies any of them may have in any jurisdiction
to resolve such matter.

         8.2. OTHER MATERIAL BREACHES.

         (a)  Except  as set  forth in  SECTION  8.1,  in the  event  one  party
determines  that the other party has committed a material  breach of a provision
of this Agreement,  such party may provide written notice to the breaching party
("Breach  Notice")  specifying the material  breach  complained of in reasonable
detail and  requiring  such other party to rectify  such breach.  The  breaching
party  shall then have  ninety  (90) days from  receipt of the Breach  Notice to
rectify  such  breach  or,  if such  material  breach  is such that it cannot be
rectified  within  the said  ninety  (90) day  period  but is  capable  of being
rectified  within a reasonable  period of time  thereafter,  to begin to rectify
such  breach  within  such  ninety  (90) day  period and  thereafter  to proceed
diligently  to complete  the  rectification  of the breach  within a  reasonable
period. In the event that the party receiving the Breach Notice does not rectify
the breach  within the time period  specified  in the  preceding  sentence,  the
non-breaching party shall have the right to invoke binding arbitration  pursuant
to  SECTION  8.3.  Such  arbitration  shall be the sole  and  exclusive  dispute
resolution  mechanism for resolving such matter,  the parties hereto voluntarily
waiving for  themselves  and their  respective  Affiliates  any other  rights or
remedies any of them may have in any jurisdiction to resolve such matter.

         (b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  in the event the party receiving a
Breach  Notice  disputes the other  party's  assertion  that it has  committed a
material breach of this Agreement,  such party shall promptly,  and in any event
within thirty (30) days after receiving such Breach Notice,  send written notice
of such dispute to the other party.  The parties  shall then commence good faith
negotiations  to resolve such dispute.  In the event that the parties are unable
to negotiate a resolution  of such dispute  within sixty (60) days of commencing
such good faith  negotiations,  either party shall,  if it wishes to pursue such
dispute,  invoke binding  arbitration  pursuant to SECTION 8.3. Such arbitration
shall be the sole and exclusive dispute resolution  mechanism for resolving such
matter,  the  parties  hereto  voluntarily  waiving  for  themselves  and  their
respective  Affiliates  any other rights or remedies any of them may have in any
jurisdiction to resolve such matter.
<PAGE>

         8.3.  ARBITRATION.  (a) In the event arbitration is required or invoked
pursuant to SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2, such arbitration  proceeding shall be conducted
under the auspices of the Center for Public  Resources  (the "CPR") in New York,
New York pursuant to the CPR's Model ADR  Procedures  and  Practices,  Rules and
Commentary for  Arbitration.  The arbitrators in any such  arbitration  shall be
persons  knowledgeable  in the industry with regard to the subject matter of the
arbitration.  Both the  foregoing  agreement of the parties to arbitrate any and
all such claims, and the results, determination,  finding, judgment and/or award
rendered  through  such  arbitration,  shall be final and binding on the parties
thereto and may be specifically  enforced by legal proceedings in a court having
jurisdiction over the party in question.  It is expressly  understood and agreed
by the parties that the arbitrators in any such arbitration shall have the right
to order injunctive relief (both preliminary and permanent  injunctions)  and/or
payment of  damages  as the sole and  exclusive  remedy or  remedies  awarded to
either party in  connection  with matters  referred to them pursuant to SECTIONS
8.1 AND 8.2 but in no event  shall they have the right to order  termination  of
all or any part of this Agreement.

         (b) Licensor  shall  appoint one (1)  arbitrator,  and Licensee one (1)
arbitrator  within a term of  thirty  (30)  days  from the date  arbitration  is
required or invoked pursuant to SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2, and the two (2) arbitrators
so appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator (who shall also be knowledgeable
<PAGE>

in the industry with regard to the subject matter of the  arbitration)  within a
term of  thirty  (30)  days  from  the date on  which  the  later of the two (2)
arbitrators has been selected.

         (c) If either  Licensor  or  Licensee  fails to select  its  arbitrator
within  the term  mentioned  above,  or in the event  that the two (2)  selected
arbitrators are unable or unwilling to select a third  arbitrator  within thirty
(30) days  following  the  selection  of the  later of them,  then the CPR shall
select such arbitrator  (meeting the criteria set out in SECTION 8.3(B), and the
three (3)  arbitrators so selected shall  constitute the  arbitration  panel for
purposes of the dispute.  The parties shall have thirty (30) days  thereafter to
submit their position to the  arbitrators.  The arbitrators  shall be instructed
and  required  to render  their  decision  within  thirty  (30)  days  following
completion of the arbitration.

         (d) Each  party  shall  bear  separately  the cost of their  respective
attorneys,  witnesses and experts in connection with such  arbitration and shall
jointly bear the costs of the arbitrators.

         (e) The parties  hereby waive any claim to any damages in the nature of
punitive,  exemplary or statutory damages in excess of compensatory damages, and
the arbitration tribunal is specially divested of any power to award any damages
in the  nature  of  punitive,  exemplary  or  statutory  damages  in  excess  of
compensatory damages, or any form of damages in excess of compensatory damages.

         (f) The  arbitrators  shall be the  exclusive  judges of relevance  and
materiality.  No  witness  or  party  may be  required  to waive  any  privilege
recognized by law.

         (g) Unless the  arbitrators  shall  otherwise  rule in the  interest of
justice,  all direct or rebuttal  testimony  shall be  submitted  in the form of
sworn  affidavits,  provided  that at the  request of another  party,  the party
submitting the affidavit will make the affiant available for  cross-examination.
If the affiant is not made available for cross-examination,  the affidavit shall
not be considered as evidence by the arbitrators  except if the arbitrators find
that the affiant is beyond the control of the party offering the affidavit,  the
affiant is unavailable and the interests of justice require consideration of the
evidence submitted by the affiant.
<PAGE>

         (h) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event of a breach by  either  party of  SECTION  2.1 the  other  party  shall be
entitled,  if it so elects, to institute and prosecute  proceedings in any court
of competent  jurisdiction  to enforce the specific  performance of such party's
obligations pursuant to such section.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                           SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

         9.1. SURVIVAL OF  REPRESENTATIONS.  The representations and warranties

of each such sublicense,  (ii) the sublicensee is required to maintain standards
of quality at least equivalent to those set forth in ARTICLE 4 of this Agreement

sublicensee as are contained in ARTICLE 4 of this  Agreement.  Without  limiting
the foregoing,  Licensor acknowledges and agrees that contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement  Licensee will enter into a sublicense of its rights
hereunder with Hershey Foods Corporation.
<PAGE>

         10.3.  ASSIGNMENT.  Licensor may assign this  Agreement in its entirety
without the prior written consent of Licensee  provided that any such assignment
is made only in conjunction with an assignment of the Trademarks,  Patent Rights
and Technical  Information  to such  assignee.  Licensor  further  covenants and
agrees  that it shall not  assign the  Trademarks,  Patent  Rights or  Technical
Information  other than in  conjunction  with its  assignment  of its rights and
obligations  under this  Agreement  to such  assignee.  Licensee may assign this
Agreement (other than its obligations pursuant to SECTION 6.2(C), in whole or in

obligations  under this Agreement with respect to one or more of the Trademarks)
with  respect to the United  States as a whole,  Canada as a whole,  Mexico as a

reasonably  acceptable  to  Licensor,  assuming  all of  Licensee's  rights  and
obligations  under this Agreement,  and provided  further that (a) Hershey Foods
Corporation guarantees such assignee's performance of its obligations under this
Agreement; or (b)(i) such assignee has at the time of the assignment a net worth

         11.3.  WAIVER.  Failure or delay of either party at any time to require
performance of any provisions under this Agreement shall not affect the right of
such party to require full  performance  thereafter and a waiver by either party
of a breach of any provision of this Agreement  shall not be taken or held to be
a waiver of any further or similar breach or as nullifying the  effectiveness of
such provision.  A waiver of any provision  hereunder shall be effective only if
such  waiver is in writing and signed by the party  against  whom such waiver is
sought to be enforced.  Failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise
any right, remedy, power or privilege provided for herein shall not operate as a
waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any such  right,
remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other rights, remedy, power or privilege.

         11.4. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement
and understanding  between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, representations, understandings
and agreements,  whether oral or in writing, between the parties with respect to
such subject  matter,  including  without  limitation,  the Original  Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall affect in any way the effectiveness
of the  Original  Agreement  from  December  30,  1996 to June  30,  1999.  This
Agreement may be altered,  modified or amended only by a written document signed
by the parties hereto.

         11.5.  SEVERABILITY.  In the event that any clause,  term or  provision
hereof  is  determined  by any  court  or  administrative  agency  of  competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability  of the  remaining  provisions  hereof  will  not  in any  way be
affected or impaired thereby.

         11.6. FORCE MAJEURE.  Any delays in or failure of performance by either
party under this Agreement shall not be considered a breach hereof if such delay
or failure is occasioned by an event beyond the reasonable  control of the party
affected  ("force  majeure"),  provided that the Licensee  shall  continue to be
obligated to pay to the  Licensor  any and all amounts  which it shall have duly
become  obligated to pay in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to
the  occurrence  of such an event,  and  FURTHER  PROVIDED  THAT any party whose
performance  is so delayed shall give prompt  notice  thereof to the other party
and  shall  use all  reasonable  endeavors  to  comply  with  the  terms of this
Agreement as soon as possible.  Force  majeure in this  context  shall  include,
without limitation,  acts of government, acts of God, fires, floods, explosions,
riots, civil disturbances, strikes, insurrections,  earthquakes, wars, rebellion
and epidemics.

         11.7.  NOTICES.  Any notice  referred to in this Agreement may be given
either (i) by first  class  certified  or  registered  airmail,  return  receipt
requested, postage prepaid, or (ii) by means of electronic recorded transmission
whereby  the  party  giving  such  notice   receives  an  immediate   electronic

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                           KEY EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN
                     (Amended and Restated as of June 9, 1999)
1.
   ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

     Hershey Foods Corporation (the  "Corporation")  hereby  establishes the Key
     Employee Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to provide
     to selected  key  employees of the  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  (as
     defined  below),  upon whose efforts the  Corporation  is dependent for the
     successful  conduct of its  business,  further  incentive  to continue  and
     increase  their  efforts  as  employees  and to remain in the employ of the
     Corporation and its subsidiaries.

     The Plan  continues  the Annual  Incentive  Program  ("AIP"),  with certain
     modifications,  as in effect under the Corporation's  Management  Incentive
     Plan ("MIP")  established  in 1975 and as amended  thereafter,  pursuant to
     which participants are entitled to receive cash awards based on achievement
     of  performance  goals  during  annual  performance  cycles.  The Plan also
     continues the Long-Term  Incentive Program ("LTIP") portion of the MIP with
     certain modifications. In addition to performance stock units ("Performance
     Stock  Units"),  the LTIP  portion  now also  includes  nonqualified  stock
     options for the purchase of Common Stock  ("Options");  stock  appreciation
     rights ("SARs"); and restricted stock units ("Restricted Stock Units").

     As used  herein,  (i) the  term  "Subsidiary  Corporation"  shall  mean any
     present  or  future   corporation  which  is  or  would  be  a  "subsidiary
     corporation"  of the  Corporation as defined in Section 424 of the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and (ii) the term "Corporation"  defined
     above  shall  refer  collectively  to  Hershey  Foods  Corporation  and its
     Subsidiary Corporations unless the context indicates otherwise.

                                       1
<PAGE>

2.   STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

     The aggregate  number of shares which may be covered by  Performance  Stock
     Units,  Options,  SARs and Restricted  Stock Units granted  pursuant to the
     LTIP  portion  of  the  Plan  is  6.5  million  (6,500,000)  shares  of the
     Corporation's  Common Stock, $1.00 Par Value (the "Common Stock"),  subject
     to adjustment in accordance with Section 12 below.  The shares issued under
     this Plan may be either  authorized but unissued  shares,  treasury  shares
     held by the  Corporation  or any direct or indirect  subsidiary  thereof or
     shares acquired by the Corporation  through open market purchases  (whether
     made before or after any  exercise of  Options(s)  or the granting of stock
     compensation hereunder) or otherwise. In addition to shares of Common Stock
     actually  issued or  distributed  under the Plan,  there shall be deemed to
     have been  issued a number of shares  equal to (i) the  number of shares of
     Common Stock in respect of which  optionees  utilize the manner of exercise
     of, and payment for,  Options as provided in Paragraph 7II(g) of this Plan,
     and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock which is  equivalent in value
     to any cash amounts  distributed  upon payment of Performance  Stock Units,
     SARs or Restricted  Stock Units.  For purposes of determining the charge to
     be made pursuant to subpart (ii) against the shares of Common Stock subject
     to the Plan,  the value of a share of Common Stock shall be its Fair Market
     Value as  defined  in  Paragraph  4 when  awards  are made with  respect to
     Performance  Stock Units, upon exercise of SARs, and upon expiration of the
     applicable  restriction  period of Restricted  Stock Units.  Any shares
     subject under the Plan to Performance  Stock Units,  Options,  SARs or
     Restricted  Stock Units which, for any reason, expire or terminate or are
     forfeited or surrendered shall again be available for issuance under the
     Plan.


3.   ADMINISTRATION

     The  Plan  shall  be  administered  by  the   Compensation   and  Executive
     Organization  Committee  (the  "Committee"),  or any  successor  committee,
     appointed  by and  consisting  solely of members of the Board of  Directors
     (the  "Board")  of the  Corporation,  each  of  whom  qualifies  as  both a
     "nonemployee  director"  within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 or its  successor
     under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 (the  "Exchange  Act") and an
     "outside  director"  within  the

                                       2
<PAGE>

     meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.  Committee  members shall not be
     eligible to  participate  in the Plan. The Board may from time to time
     remove and appoint members of the  Committee  in  substitution  for, or in
     addition  to,  members previously appointed and may fill vacancies, however
     caused, in the Committee.  The Committee may adopt such rules and
     regulations as it deems useful in governing its affairs.  Any action of the
     Committee  with respect to the  administration  of the Plan  shall be taken
     by  majority  vote at a  Committee meeting or written consent of all
     Committee members.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,  the Committee  shall have
     authority:  (i) to construe and interpret Plan  provisions;  (ii) to define
     the terms used in the Plan; (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
     regulations  relating to the Plan; (iv) to select  particular  employees to
     participate in the Plan, (v) to determine the terms,  conditions,  form and
     amount of  grants,  distributions  or  payments  made to each  participant,
     including  conditions  upon  and  provisions  for  vesting,   exercise  and
     acceleration  of any  grants,  distributions  or  payments;  (vi)  upon the
     request of a participant in the Plan, to approve and determine the duration
     of leaves  of  absence  which may be  granted  to the  participant  without
     constituting  a termination  of his or her  employment  for purposes of the
     Plan; and (vii) to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for
     the  administration and operation of the Plan. The Committee shall have the
     right to impose varying terms and conditions  with respect to each grant or
     award. All determinations and  interpretations  made by the Committee shall
     be final,  binding and  conclusive on all  participants  and on their legal
     representatives and beneficiaries.

4.   FAIR MARKET VALUE

     As used in the Plan (unless a different  method of  calculation is required
     by  applicable  law, and except as otherwise  specifically  provided in any
     Plan  provision),  "Fair Market  Value" on or as of any date shall mean (i)
     the  closing  price of the Common  Stock as  reported in the New York Stock
     Exchange   Composite   Transactions   Report  (or  any  other  consolidated
     transactions reporting system which subsequently may replace such Composite
     Transactions   Report)  for  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange   trading  day
     immediately  preceding such date, or if there are


                                       3
<PAGE>

     no sales on such date, on the next preceding day on which there were sales,
     or (ii) in the event that the Common  Stock is no longer listed  for
     trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  an  amount determined in
     accordance with standards adopted by the Committee.


5.   ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

     Key employees of the Corporation or of any of its Subsidiary  Corporations,
     including  officers and directors who are regular employees but not members
     of the Committee,  who in the opinion of the Committee are in a position to
     contribute   significantly  to  the  success  of  the  Corporation  or  any
     Subsidiary  Corporation,  division  or  operating  unit  thereof,  shall be
     eligible for selection to participate in the Plan. In making this selection
     and in  determining  the form  and  amount  of  grants,  distributions  and
     payments under the Plan,  the Committee  shall take into account the duties
     of the respective employees,  their present and potential  contributions to
     the success of the Corporation or any Subsidiary  Corporation,  division or
     operating  unit  thereof,  and such other factors as the Committee may deem
     relevant in  connection  with  accomplishing  the purposes of the Plan.  An
     employee  who  has  been  selected  to  participate  may,  if he or  she is
     otherwise eligible,  receive more than one grant from time to time, and may
     be granted any  combination  of  contingent  target grants under the AIP or
     under the LTIP components of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine.

6.   ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM

     The Committee may from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the Plan
     and such  other  terms  and  conditions  as the  Committee  may  determine,
     establish  contingent target grants for those eligible employees it selects
     to participate in the AIP. Each such contingent  grant may be, but need not
     be, evidenced by a written instrument,  and shall be determined in relation
     to the  participant's  level of  responsibility  in the Corporation and the
     competitive  compensation  practices  of other major  businesses,  and such
     other factors as are deemed appropriate by the Committee.

     (a) Awards actually earned by and paid to AIP  participants  ("AIP Awards")
         will be based  primarily upon  achievement of performance  goals over a
         one-year performance cycle as approved by the Committee.

     (b) The Committee, within the limits of the Plan, shall have full authority
         and  discretion  to  determine  the  time  or  times  of   establishing
         contingent  target  grants;  to select  from among those  eligible  the
         employees to receive  awards;  to review and certify the achievement of
         performance  goals;  to  designate  levels  of  awards  to be earned in
         relation to levels of achievement of performance  goals;  to adopt such
         financial  and  nonfinancial  performance  or  other  criteria  for the
         payment  of  awards  as it may  determine  from  time to time;  to make
         awards;  and to  establish  such other  measures as may be necessary to
         achieve the  objectives  of the Plan.  The  financial or  non-financial
         performance goals established by the Committee may be based upon one or
         more of the following: earnings per share, return on net assets, market
         share,  control of costs, net sales,  cash flow,  economic  value-added
         measures, sales growth, earnings growth, stock price, return on equity,
         improvements in financial ratings,  regulatory compliance,  achievement
         of balance sheet or income statement objectives, or any other objective
         goals established by the Committee (the "Performance Factors").

     (c) Aggregate  annual AIP Awards  shall not exceed six (6%)  percent of the
         excess of Before-Tax  Income  (defined for these purposes as Net Income
         plus  provision for Federal,  state and local income taxes and interest
         expense on long-term debt, but after  consideration  of the cost of the
         cost of the Plan) over sixteen (16%) percent of Total Invested Capital
         (defined for these  purposes as  Stockholders'  Equity  plus  Long-Term
         Debt  plus Deferred Income Taxes) determined as the average of such
         Total Invested Capital  at the  beginning  of the  year  and the end of
         each  calendar quarter of such year. The maximum amount any participant
         can receive as an AIP Award for any calendar year shall not exceed
         $2,100,000.

     (d) AIP Awards as earned  under the terms of the Plan shall be paid in cash
         and may exceed or be less than the contingent  target grants,  provided
         that  payments  do not exceed  the

                                       5
<PAGE>


         maximum  permitted cost of the AIP calculated  pursuant to subparagraph
         (c) above.  Payment shall normally be made as soon as  possible
         following  the  close  of the  year,  but payment of all or any portion
         may be deferred by participants  with the approval of the Committee.

7.   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM

     The LTIP consists of the following four components:

     I.  PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS

         The Committee may, subject to the provisions of the Plan and such other
         terms and conditions as the Committee may determine,  grant Performance
         Stock  Units  to  reflect  the  value  of   contingent   target  grants
         established for each eligible employee selected for participation. Each
         grant of Performance  Stock Units may be, but need not be, evidenced by
         a written instrument. Such contingent target grants shall be determined
         in  relation  to  the  employee's  level  of   responsibility   in  the
         Corporation or any Subsidiary  Corporation,  division or operating unit
         thereof,  and the  competitive  compensation  practices  of other major
         businesses.

         (a)  Awards actually earned by and paid to holders of Performance Stock
              Units ("PSU Awards") will be based upon achievement of performance
              goals over performance  cycles as approved by the Committee.  Such
              performance  cycles  each  shall  cover such  period of time,  not
              exceeding  five years,  as the  Committee  from time to time shall
              determine.

         (b)  The  Committee,  within  the  limits of the Plan,  shall have full
              authority  and  discretion  to  determine  the  time or  times  of
              establishing   contingent   target  grants  and  the  granting  of
              Performance  Stock Units;  to select from among those eligible the
              employees  to  receive  PSU  Awards;  to review  and  certify  the
              achievement of performance goals; to designate levels of awards to
              be earned in  relation  to levels of  achievement of

                                       6
<PAGE>

              performance goals;  to adopt such  financial and  nonfinancial
              performance or other  criteria for the payment of PSU Awards as it
              may  determine from time to time; to make awards; and to establish
              such other measures as may be necessary to the  objectives  of the
              Plan.  The performance goals established by the Committee may be
              based on one or more of the Performance Factors.

         (c)  Payments of PSU Awards  shall be made in shares of Common Stock or
              partly  in cash as the  Committee  in its  sole  discretion  shall
              determine and shall be charged against the shares  available under
              the LTIP portion of the Plan as provided in Paragraph 2; provided,
              however,  that no  fractional  shares shall be issued and any such
              fraction will be  eliminated  by rounding  downward to the nearest
              whole share. In any case in which actual payment of a PSU Award is
              deferred as  provided  below,  a charge  will be made  against the
              available shares for the number of shares equivalent to the dollar
              amount of the deferred PSU Award.

         (d)  PSU Awards as earned  under the terms of the Plan may exceed or be
              less than the contingent target grants.  Payment shall normally be
              made as soon as  possible  following  the close of the  year,  but
              payment of all or any portion may be deferred by participants with
              the approval of the Committee.

         (e) The maximum amount a participant  can receive as a PSU Award in any
             calendar year is $2,430,000.

     II. STOCK OPTIONS

         The Committee may, from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the
         Plan and such other terms and  conditions  as it may  determine,  grant
         nonqualified  Options  to  purchase  shares  of  Common  Stock  of  the
         Corporation  to employees  eligible to  participate  in the Plan.  Each
         grant of an Option shall be on such terms and conditions and be in such
         form as the  Committee  may from time to time  approve,  subject to the
         following:

<PAGE>

         (a)  The exercise  price per share with respect to each Option shall be
              determined by the Committee in its sole discretion,  but shall not
              be less than 100% of the Fair Market  Value of the Common Stock as
              of the date of the grant of the Option.

         (b)  Options  granted  under  the Plan  shall be  exercisable,  in such
              installments  and for such  periods,  as shall be  provided by the
              Committee  at the  time of  granting,  but in no event  shall  any
              Option granted extend for a period in excess of ten years from the
              date of grant.

         (c)  The maximum  number of shares of Common  Stock  covered by Options
              granted to a  participant  for any calendar  year shall not exceed
              250,000.

         (d)  Among other  conditions  that may be imposed by the Committee,  if
              deemed  appropriate,  are  those  relating  to (i) the  period  or
              periods and the conditions of exercisability  of any Option;  (ii)
              the minimum  periods  during  which  grantees  of Options  must be
              employed, or must hold Options before they may be exercised; (iii)
              the minimum  periods  during which shares  acquired  upon exercise
              must be held  before  sale or transfer  shall be  permitted;  (iv)
              conditions  under  which such  Options or shares may be subject to
              forfeiture;  and (v) the  frequency  of exercise or the minimum or
              maximum number of shares that may be acquired at any one time.

         (e)  Exercise  of an Option  shall be by  written  notice  stating  the
              election  to  exercise  in the form and manner  determined  by the
              Committee.

         (f)  The  purchase  price upon  exercise of any Option shall be paid in
              full by making  payment  (i) in cash;  (ii) in whole or in part by
              the delivery of a certificate or  certificates of shares of Common
              Stock of the Corporation, valued at its then Fair Market Value; or
              (iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii).

         (g)  Notwithstanding  subparagraph  (e) above,  any  optionee  may make
              payment of the Option price through a simultaneous exercise of his
              or her Option and sale of the

                                       8
<PAGE>

              shares thereby acquired  pursuant to a brokerage  arrangement
              approved in advance by the Committee to assure its conformity with
              the terms and conditions of the Plan.

         (h)  The  Committee may require the  surrender of  outstanding  Options
              as a condition to the grant of new Options.

         (i)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of the Plan or of any Option
              agreement  between  the  Corporation  and an  employee,  upon  the
              occurrence of a Change in Control, each outstanding Option held by
              a  participant  who  is an  employee  of  the  Corporation  or any
              Subsidiary  Corporation  or  who  retired  while  employed  by the
              Corporation  or any  Subsidiary  Corporation  shall  become  fully
              vested and  exercisable  notwithstanding  any vesting  schedule or
              installment schedule relating to the exercisability of such Option
              contained  in  the  applicable   Option   agreement  or  otherwise
              established at the time of grant of the Option.

         (j)  For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" means:

              (1) Individuals  who, on June 8, 1999,  constitute  the Board (the
                  "Incumbent  Directors")  cease for any reason to constitute at
                  least a  majority  of the  Board,  provided  that  any  person
                  becoming a director subsequent to June 8, 1999, whose election
                  or nomination  for election was approved by a vote of at least
                  two-thirds  of the  Incumbent  Directors  then  on  the  Board
                  (either by specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement
                  of the  Corporation  in which such  person is named as nominee
                  for director,  without written  objection to such  nomination)
                  shall be an Incumbent  Director;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no

                  contest (as  described in Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange  Act)
                  ("Election   Contest")   or   other   actual   or   threatened
                  solicitation  of  proxies or  consents  by or on behalf of any
                  person  (as such term is  defined  in  Section  3(a)(9) of the
                  Exchange  Act and as used in Section  13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of

                  Election  Contest or Proxy Contest,  shall be  deemed  an
                  Incumbent  Director;   and  PROVIDED  FURTHER, HOWEVER,  that
                  a director who has been approved by the Hershey Trust while it

                  of the then outstanding  voting securities of the Corporation
                  entitled  to vote  generally  in the  election of directors
                  (the "Outstanding Corporation  Voting Power") shall
                   be deemed to be an Incumbent Director; or

              (2) The  acquisition  or  holding  by  any  Person  of  beneficial
                  ownership  (within  the  meaning  of Section  13(d)  under the
                  Exchange  Act  and  the  rules  and  regulations   promulgated
                  thereunder)  of shares of the Common  Stock and/or the Class B
                  Common Stock of the  Corporation  representing  25% or more of
                  either (i) the total number of then outstanding shares of both

                  Corporation  Voting Power;  provided that, at the time of such
                  acquisition  or holding of  beneficial  ownership  of any such
                  shares,  the Hershey Trust does not beneficially own more than
                  50% of the Outstanding Corporation Voting Power; and provided,
                  further,  that any such  acquisition  or holding of beneficial
                  ownership  of shares of either  Common Stock or Class B Common
                  Stock  of the  Corporation  by any of the  following  entities

              price at which all  Options  then  held by each  such  participant
              could  be  exercised  upon  the  obtaining  of  such   stockholder
              approval.

     III.STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

         The Committee may, from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the
         Plan  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Committee  may
         determine, grant SARs to employees eligible to participate in the Plan.
         SARs may, but need not be  evidenced  by an  agreement  executed by
         the Corporation  and the  holder,  and shall be  subject  to such terms
         and conditions  consistent with the Plan as the Committee shall impose
         from time to time, including the following:

         (a)  SARs may, but need not,  relate to Options granted under the Plan,
              as the Committee  shall  determine  from time to time. In no event
              shall any SARs granted  extend for a period in excess of ten years
              from the date of grant.

         (b)  A holder shall  exercise his or her SARs by giving  written notice
              of  such  exercise  in  the  form  and  manner  determined  by the
              Committee, and the date upon which such written notice is received
              by the Corporation shall be the exercise date for the SARs.

         (c)  A holder of SARs shall be entitled to receive  upon  exercise  the
              excess of the Fair Market  Value of a share of Common Stock at the
              time of exercise over the Fair Market Value of a share at the time
              the SARs were  granted,  multiplied  by the number of shares  with
              respect to which the SARs relate.

         (d)  In the sole discretion of the Committee, the amount payable to the
              holder upon exercise of SARs may be paid either in Common Stock or
              in cash or in a combination  thereof. To the extent paid in Common
              Stock,  the value of the Common  Stock  that shall be  distributed
              shall be the Fair  Market  Value of a share of Common  Stock  upon
              exercise  of the  SARs  as  provided  in  Paragraph  2;  provided,
              however,  that no  fractional  shares shall be issued and any such
              fraction will be  eliminated  by rounding  downward to the nearest
              whole share.

                                       13
<PAGE>

         (e)  In the sole discretion of the Committee,  SARs related to specific
              Options may be exercisable only upon surrender of all or a portion
              of the related Option, or may be exercisable, in whole or in part,
              only at such times and to the extent  that the  related  Option is
              exercisable,  and the number of shares purchasable pursuant to the
              related  Option  may be  reduced  to the  extent of the  number of
              shares with respect to which the SARs are exercised.

         (f)  In lieu of  receiving  payment  at the time of  exercise  of SARs,
              payment of all or any portion  may be deferred by the  participant
              with the approval of the Committee.

         (g)  The maximum  number of SARs  granted to a  participant  during any
              calendar year shall not exceed 250,000.

     IV. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

         The Committee may, from time to time,  subject to the provisions of the
         Plan and such other terms and  conditions  as it may  determine,  grant
         Restricted  Stock Units to  employees  eligible to  participate  in the
         Plan.  Each  grant of  Restricted  Stock  Units may be, but need not be
         evidenced by a written instrument.  The grant of Restricted Stock Units
         shall state the number of Restricted  Stock Units covered by the grant,
         and shall contain such terms and  conditions and be in such form as the
         Committee may from time to time approve, subject to the following:

         (a)  Each Restricted Stock Unit shall be equivalent in value to a share
              of Common Stock.

         (b)  Vesting of each grant of Restricted  Stock Units shall require the
              holder  to  remain  in  the  employment  of the  Corporation  or a
              Subsidiary  Corporation  for a prescribed  period (a  "Restriction
              Period").  The Committee shall determine the Restriction Period or
              Periods which shall apply to the shares of Common Stock covered by
              each  grant  of  Restricted  Stock  Units.   Except  as  otherwise
              determined by the Committee and provided in the written instrument
              granting  the  Restricted  Stock  Units,  and except as  otherwise

                                       14
<PAGE>

              provided in Paragraph 8, all  Restricted  Stock Units granted to a
              participant under the Plan shall terminate upon termination of the
              participant's  employment  with the  Corporation or any Subsidiary
              Corporation  before the end of the  Restriction  Period or Periods
              applicable to such Restricted  Stock Units,  and in such event the
              holder  shall not be entitled to receive any payment  with respect
              to those  Restricted  Stock Units.  The Committee may also, in its
              sole  discretion,  establish  other terms and  conditions  for the
              vesting of Restricted Stock Units,  including conditioning vesting
              on the  achievement  of one or  more of the  Performance  Factors.
              Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or of any written
              instrument  granting Ristricted Stock Units, upn the occurrence of
              a Change in Control as defined in  subparagraph  (j) of  Paragraph
              7II hereof,  all  restrictions on Ristricted Stock Units held by a
              participant   who  is  an  employee  of  the  Corporation  or  any
              Subsidiary Corporation shall lapse.

         (c)  Upon expiration of the Restriction Period or Periods applicable to
              each grant of Restricted  Stock Units,  the holder shall,  without
              payment on his part,  be entitled to receive  payment in an amount
              equal to the  aggregate  Fair Market Value of the shares of Common
              Stock covered by such grant upon such expiration. Such payment may
              be made in cash,  in shares of Common Stock equal to the number of
              Restricted Stock Units with respect to which such payment is made,
              or in any  combination  thereof,  as  the  Committee  in its  sole
              discretion shall  determine.  Any payment in cash shall reduce the
              number  of  shares of  Common  Stock  available  under the Plan as
              provided in Paragraph 2, to the extent of the number of Restricted
              Stock  Units to which  such  payment  relates.  Further  upon such
              expiration, the holder shall be entitled to receive a cash payment
              in an amount  equal to each cash  dividend the  Corporation  would
              have paid to such holder during the term of those Restricted Stock
              Units as if the  holder had been the owner of record of the shares
              of Common  Stock  covered by such  Restricted  Stock  Units on the
              record date for the payment of such dividend.

                                       15
<PAGE>

         (d)  In lieu of  receiving  payment  at the time of  expiration  of the
              Restriction  Period or Periods,  payment of all or any portion may
              be deferred by the participant with the approval of the Committee.

         (e)  The  maximum  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  as  to  which
              Restricted  Stock  Units may be granted to a  participant  for any
              calendar year shall not exceed 50,000.

8.   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     Upon  termination of employment  with the  Corporation of any  participant,
     such  participant's  rights with respect to any  contingent  target  grants
     under the AIP, or any Performance Stock Units,  Options, SARs or Restricted
     Stock Units granted under the LTIP, shall be as follows:

     (a) In the event that the  participant  is  terminated or discharged by the
         Corporation  for any reason,  the  participant's  rights and  interests
         under the Plan shall  immediately  terminate upon notice of termination
         of employment. Upon the occurrence of a Potential Change in Control (as
         defined in  subparagraph  (k) of Paragraph 7II hereof) and for a period
         of one year thereafter,  and upon the occurrence of a Change in Control
         (as defined in subparagraph (j) of Paragraph 7II hereof), the following
         special  provisions and notice  requirements shall be applicable in the
         event of the termination of the employment of any  participant  holding
         an Option under the Plan:  (i) in no event may a notice of  termination
         of employment be issued to such a participant  unless at least ten (10)
         business  days  prior to the  effective  date of such  termination  the
         participant  is provided  with a written  notice of intent to terminate
         the participant's  employment which sets forth in reasonable detail the
         reason for such intent to terminate, the date on which such termination
         is to be effective, and a description of the participant's rights under
         this Plan and under the  agreements  granting  such  Option or Options,
         including  the fact that no such  Option  may be  exercised  after such
         termination  has become  effective and the manner,  extent and price at
         which all Options then held by such  participant may be exercised;  and
         (ii) such  notice of intent to  terminate  a  participant's  employment
         shall not be considered a "notice of  termination  of  employment"  for
         purposes of the first  sentence of this Paragraph 8 (a). This Paragraph

                                       16
<PAGE>

         8 (a) is  intended  only to  provide  for a  requirement  of  notice to
         terminate  upon the occurrence of the events set forth herein and shall
         not be construed to create an obligation  of continued  employment or a
         contract of  employment  in any manner or to otherwise  affect or limit
         the   Corporation's   ability  to  terminate  the   employment  of  any
         participant holding an Option under the Plan.

     (b) If a participant  terminates  employment  with the  Corporation  as the
         result,  in the sole judgment of the Committee,  of his or her becoming
         totally disabled (in which event termination will be deemed to occur on
         the date the Committee makes such  determination),  or if a participant
         should  die or (except  as to  Restricted  Stock  Units)  retire  while
         employed by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiary Corporations, then
         the  participant  or, as the case may be, the person or persons to whom
         the participant's  interest under the Plan shall pass by will or by the
         laws of  descent  and  distribution  (the  "Estate"),  shall  have  the
         following rights:

         (i)  the  grantee  of a  contingent  AIP grant or the  Estate  shall be
              entitled to receive payment of an AIP award as, and to the extent,
              determined by the Committee;

         (ii) if the holder of Performance  Stock Units shall have been employed
              for at least two-thirds of the related  performance cycle prior to
              the date of  termination  or  death,  then,  except  as  otherwise
              provided  in  the  written  instrument  (if  any)  evidencing  the
              Performance  Stock Units,  and subject to any further  adjustments
              the Committee may make in its absolute discretion, the participant
              or the Estate shall be entitled to receive  payment of a PSU Award
              upon the  expiration of the related  performance  cycle, provided
              that such award shall be  adjusted  by  multiplying  the
              amount thereof by a fraction,  the numerator of which shall be the
              number of full  and  partial  calendar  months  between  the  date
              of the beginning of each such performance cycle and  the  date  of
              termination  or death,  and the  denominator of which shall be the
              number of full and  partial  calendar  months from the date of the
              beginning  of  the  performance  cycle  to the  end  of  the  said
              performance cycle;

                                       17
<PAGE>

         (iii)except as otherwise  provided in the terms and  conditions  of the
              stock  option or SAR  grant,  the  holder or the  Estate  shall be
              entitled to exercise  (provided any vesting  requirement  has been
              satisfied  as of the date of  exercise)  any  Option  or SAR for a
              period of five years  (three  years in the case of options or SARs
              granted prior to 1997) from such date of death,  total  disability
              or  retirement,  or for such longer  period as the  Committee  may
              determine  in the case of  financial  hardship  or  other  unusual
              circumstances  (subject to the maximum exercise period for Options
              and  SARs  specified  in  Paragraph  7II(b)  and  7III(a)  hereof,
              respectively);

         (iv) except as otherwise provided in the written instrument  evidencing
              the Restricted Stock Units, upon death or termination due to total
              disability  the holder or the Estate  shall be entitled to receive
              payment in respect of the  Restricted  Stock Units,  provided that
              such Units shall be adjusted by multiplying  the amount thereof by
              a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full and
              partial  calendar  months  between the date of grant of such Units
              and the date of death or termination, and the denominator of which
              shall be the number of full and partial  calendar  months from the
              date of the  grant  to the  end of the  Restriction  Period.  Upon
              retirement,  the  participant's  rights with respect to Restricted
              Stock Units shall immediately terminate.

     (c) In the  event of  resignation  by the  participant,  the  participant's
         rights and interests  under the Plan shall  immediately  terminate upon
         such resignation;  provided, however, that the Committee shall have the
         absolute  discretion  to review the  reasons and  circumstances  of the
         resignation  and to  determine  whether,  alternatively,  and  to  what
         extent,  if any,  the  participant  may  continue to hold any rights or
         interests under the Plan.

     (d) A transfer of a participant's  employment without an intervening period
         from the Corporation to a Subsidiary Corporation or vice versa, or from
         one  Subsidiary   Corporation  to  another,   shall  not  be  deemed  a
         termination of employment.

     (e) The  Committee  shall  be  authorized  to make all  determinations  and
         calculations required by this Paragraph 8, including any determinations

                                       18
<PAGE>

         necessary to establish the reason for  terminations  of employment  for
         purposes of the Plan, which  determinations  and calculations  shall be
         conclusive and binding on any affected participants and Estates.

9.   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     No  Performance  Stock  Units,  Options,  SARs or  Restricted  Stock  Units
     (hereinafter collectively an "Interest") granted pursuant to the Plan shall
     be exercisable or realized in whole or in part, and the  Corporation  shall
     not be obligated  to sell,  distribute  or issue any shares  subject to any
     such Interest,  if such exercise and sale would,  in the opinion of counsel
     for the  Corporation,  violate the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended (or
     other Federal or state statutes having similar requirements). Each Interest
     shall be subject to the further  requirement that, if at any time the Board
     of  Directors  shall  determine  in its  discretion  that  the  listing  or
     qualification  of the shares relating or subject to such Interest under any
     securities  exchange  requirements  or under  any  applicable  law,  or the
     consent or approval of any  governmental  regulatory  body, is necessary or
     desirable as a condition  of, or in connection  with,  the granting of such
     Interest or the distribution or issue of shares  thereunder,  such Interest
     may  not  be   exercised   in  whole  or  in  part  unless  such   listing,
     qualification,  consent or  approval  shall have been  effected or obtained
     free of any condition not acceptable to the Board of Directors.

     Interests may be subject to restrictions as to resale or other  disposition
     and to such other  provisions as may be  appropriate to comply with Federal
     and state securities laws and stock exchange requirements, and the exercise
     of any Interest or entitlement to payment thereunder may be contingent upon
     receipt  from the holder  (or any other  person  permitted  by this Plan to
     exercise  any  Interest  or  receive  any  distribution   hereunder)  of  a
     representation  that at the  time of such  exercise  it is his or her  then
     present  intention to acquire the shares being  distributed  for investment
     and not for resale.

10.  NONTRANSFERABILITY

     Unless  otherwise  approved  by  the  Committee,   contingent  AIP  grants,
     Performance Stock Units,  Options,  SARs and Restricted Stock Units granted
     under  the Plan to an  employee  shall

                                       19
<PAGE>


     be  nonassignable  and  shall not be transferable  by him or her  otherwise
     than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be
     exercisable, during the employee's lifetime, only by the employee or the
     employee's guardian or legal representative.

11.  DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

     No provision in the Plan or any contingent  target AIP grants,  Performance
     Stock Units,  Options,  SARs or Restricted  Stock Units granted pursuant to
     the Plan shall be construed to confer upon the  participant any right to be
     employed  by  the  Corporation  or by  any  Subsidiary  Corporation,  or to
     interfere in any way with the right and authority of the Corporation or any
     Subsidiary  Corporation  either to increase or decrease the compensation of
     the participant at any time, or to terminate any relationship of employment
     between  the  participant  and  the  Corporation  or any of its  Subsidiary
     Corporations.

     Participants  under the Plan shall have none of the rights of a stockholder
     of the  Corporation  with respect to shares  subject to  Performance  Stock
     Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units unless and until such shares
     have been issued to him or her.

12.  STOCK ADJUSTMENTS

     In the event that the shares of Common  Stock,  as  presently  constituted,
     shall be changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
     of stock or other  securities of the Corporation or of another  corporation
     (whether   by   reason   of   merger,   consolidation,    recapitalization,
     reclassification,  stock split, combination of shares or otherwise),  or if
     the number of such shares of Common  Stock shall be  increased  through the
     payment of a stock dividend, or a dividend on the shares of Common Stock of
     rights or warrants to purchase securities of the Corporation shall be made,
     then there shall be substituted  for or added to each share available under
     and  subject to the Plan as  provided  in  Paragraph  2 hereof,  and to the
     limitations set forth in Paragraphs 7II (c); 7III (g) and 7IV (e), and each
     share  theretofore  appropriated or thereafter  subject or which may become
     subject to Performance Stock Units, Options, SARs or Restricted Stock Units
     under the Plan, the number and kind of shares of stock or other  securities

                                       20
<PAGE>


     into which each  outstanding  share of Common  Stock shall be so changed or
     for which each such share  shall be  exchanged  or to which each such share
     shall be entitled,  as the case may be.  Outstanding  Options and SARs also
     shall be  appropriately  amended  as to  price  and  other  terms as may be
     necessary to reflect the foregoing  events. In the event there shall be any
     other  change  in the  number or kind of the  outstanding  shares of Common
     Stock,  or of any stock or other  securities  into which the  Common  Stock
     shall have been changed or for which it shall have been exchanged,  then if
     the Board of Directors shall, in its sole  discretion,  determine that such
     change  equitably  requires an adjustment in the shares available under and
     subject to the Plan, or in any Performance  Stock Units,  Options,  SARs or
     Restricted  Stock Units  theretofore  granted or which may be granted under
     the  Plan,  such  adjustments   shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  such
     determination.

     No fractional  shares of Common Stock or units of other securities shall be
     issued pursuant to any such  adjustment,  and any fractions  resulting from
     any such adjustment  shall be eliminated in each case by rounding  downward
     to the nearest whole share or unit.

13.  TAXES

     The  Corporation  shall be  entitled  to  withhold  the  amount  of any tax
     attributable to any amounts  payable or shares of Common Stock  deliverable
     under the Plan. The person  entitled to any such  delivery,  whether due to
     the settlement of PSUs, the exercise of an Option or SAR, or the vesting of
     Restricted  Stock Units,  or any other  taxable event may, by notice to the
     Corporation, elect to have such withholding satisfied by a reduction of the
     number of shares otherwise so deliverable (a "Stock Withholding Election"),
     or by delivery of shares of Stock  already owned by the  Participant,  with
     the amount of shares subject to such reduction or delivery to be calculated
     based on the Fair Market Value on the date of such taxable event. Reporting
     Persons may make a Stock  Withholding  Election only in accordance with the
     methods then permitted under applicable  Securities and Exchange Commission
     interpretations.

14.  EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

     The Plan shall become  effective upon adoption by the Board of Directors of
     the  Corporation,  provided such adoption is approved by the  stockholders,
     within  twelve  months of  adoption by the Board of  Directors.  Contingent
     target AIP grants,  Performance Stock Units,  Options,  SARs and Restricted
     Stock Units  under this Plan,  granted  before  approval of the Plan by the
     stockholders,  shall be granted  subject to such  approval and shall not be
     exercisable or payable before such approval.

     The  Board of  Directors  at any  time may  terminate  the  Plan,  but such
     termination  shall  not alter or impair  any of the  rights or  obligations
     under any contingent target AIP grants,  Performance Stock Units,  Options,
     SARs or Restricted  Stock Units  theretofore  granted under the Plan unless
     the affected participant shall so consent.

15.  PRIOR PLAN

     Effective  upon the  adoption  of this Plan by the Board of  Directors,  no
     additional  grants  of  contingent  target  grants  under  the  AIP  or  of
     Performance  Stock  Units shall be made under the MIP;  provided,  that any
     payments  of AIP awards or  deferrals  thereof  made with  respect to prior
     grants of contingent  AIP awards,  any prior grants of any LTIP Units,  and
     any payments of LTIP awards or deferrals  thereto made with respect to such
     prior grants, shall not be affected.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
     extent the remaining  shares reserved for use under the LTIP portion of the
     MIP are  insufficient  for any LTIP awards  under  performance  cycles that
     began  prior to January 1, 1987,  shares  available  under this Plan may be
     used for such purpose.

     The  granting  of an  Option or SAR shall  impose  no  obligation  upon the
     optionee to exercise such Option or SAR.

18.  AMENDMENT

     The Board of Directors by majority vote, at any time and from time to time,
     may amend the Plan in such respects as it shall deem advisable,  to conform
     to  any   change  in  any   applicable   law  or  in  any  other   respect.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan may not be terminated or amended in
     a manner adverse to the interests of any  participant  (without the consent

     and for one (1) year  following  the  cessation  of a  Potential  Change in
     Control,  or (b) for a two-year period beginning as of the date of a Change
     in Control (the  "Coverage  Period").  Upon the  expiration of the Coverage
     Period,  subparagraph  (l) of Paragraph 7II of the Plan and Paragraph 8 (a)
     of the Plan may not be amended in any manner  that would  adversely  affect
     any participant without the consent of the participant.

                          AMENDED AND RESTATED (1999)

                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN

         1.  PURPOSE OF PLAN.  The purpose of the Amended  and  Restated  (1999)
Supplemental  Executive  Retirement Plan  (hereinafter  called the "Plan") is to
obtain for Hershey Foods Corporation  (hereinafter called the "Corporation") all
of the  benefits  which  flow  from  maintaining  a  strong  management  team by
providing  to  executive  and  upper  level  management  employees  the means to
continue  their  attained  standard of living during  retirement and by offering
benefits  that will assist in attracting  executive  and upper level  management
employees of outstanding  ability.  The Plan is an amendment to and  restatement
(as amended) of the Hershey Foods Corporation Amended and Restated  Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan, as amended from time to time which was in effect from
November 1, 1994 to June 8, 1999.

         2.       DEFINITIONS.  The  following  words and  phrases  as used in
the Plan  shall have the  following  meanings,  unless a different meaning is
plainly required by the context:

                  a.  "Cause"  means the willful  engaging by the
Participant  in illegal  conduct or gross  misconduct  which is materially and
demonstrably injurious to the Corporation.

         For purposes of this definition,  no act or failure to act, on the part
of the Participant,  shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted
to be done, by the Participant in bad faith and without  reasonable  belief that
the  Participant's   action  or  omission  was  in  the  best  interest  of  the
Corporation.  Any act or failure to act,  based upon prior approval given by the
Board or upon  the  instruction  or with the  approval  of the  Chief  Executive
Officer or the  Participant's  superior  or based upon the advice of counsel for
the  Corporation  shall be  conclusively  presumed to be done,  or omitted to be
done,  by  the  Participant  in  good  faith  and in the  best  interest  of the
Corporation.

                  b.  "Committee" means the Compensation and Executive
 Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the
 "Board").

                  c. "Deferred Retirement Date" means the first day of the month
following  a  Participant's  termination  of  employment  with  the  Corporation
provided such termination occurs after his Normal Retirement Date.

                  d.  "Disability"  or  "Disabled",  for  purposes of this Plan,
shall have the same meaning as provided in Section 1.16 of the Retirement  Plan,
as such section may be amended from time to time.

                  e.  "Early  Retirement  Date" means the first day of any month
following a Participant's  termination of employment with the Corporation  which
is coincident with or

                                       1
<PAGE>


following  a  Participant's   fifty-fifth  (55th)  birthday  and  prior  to  the
Participant's Normal Retirement Date.

                  f.  "Final  Average  Compensation"  means  the  sum of (1) the
highest annual average of a Participant's  basic salary paid or accrued over any
thirty-six  (36)  consecutive  month  period  during  his last ten (10) years of

awards under the Annual Incentive Program  (hereinafter called the "AIP") of the
Corporation's Key Employee Incentive Plan ("KEIP") paid or accrued over any five
(5) consecutive calendar years during his last ten (10) years of employment with
the Corporation.  If a Participant dies, retires, or suffers a Disability during
a calendar year and only a partial AIP award is made for that year, for purposes
of the Plan,  his AIP award for such year will be  considered to equal the award
actually  made  divided by the fraction of such year that he was employed by the
Corporation  prior to his death,  retirement  or  Disability.  If a  Participant
otherwise terminates employment with the Corporation during a calendar year, his
AIP award for that year for purposes of the Plan will be  considered  to be zero
(0), regardless of whether any AIP award is actually made for that year.

                  g. "GATT Interest Rate" means,  for purposes of this Plan, for
any specific month, the annual interest rate on 30-year  Treasury  securities as
specified  by the  Commissioner  of the  Internal  Revenue  Service  in  revenue
rulings,  notices or other guidance,  published in the Internal  Revenue Service
Bulletin,  decreased by the percentage  applicable to such month as set forth on
Schedule I attached hereto.

                  h. "Lump Sum Interest Rate" means, as of any specific date:

         2000 the sum of one twelfth (1/12th) of each PBGC Interest Rate for the

         November  1999 and each month  thereafter  to and  including the second
         month  preceding  the month during which such date occurs plus,  if the
         number  of months  for  which a GATT  Interest  Rate is  determined  as
         described is less than twelve, the sum of one-twelfth  (1/12th) of each
         PBGC  Interest  Rate for  December  1999 and  each  preceding  month in

         which such date occurs.

                   i. "Normal  Retirement  Date" means, for the purposes of this
Plan,  the first day of the month  nearest a  Participant's  sixty-fifth  (65th)
birthday,  except that if his birthday is

                                       2
<PAGE>

equally near the first of two calendar months,  the first day of the month prior
to his sixty-fifth (65th) birthday shall be his Normal Retirement Date.

                   j. "PBGC Interest Rate" means,  for any specific  month,  the
interest rate used by the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation for such month

                   k. "Participant"  means an employee of the Corporation who is
eligible to receive a benefit under the Plan in accordance  with the  provisions
of Paragraph 3 (I.E., has attained age 55, has ten (10) Years of Service and has

amended and restated  effective  January 1, 1989, as in effect from time to time
and any successor plan thereto.

                   m. "Years of Service",  for purposes of this Plan, shall have
the same meaning as provided in Section  1.56 of the  Retirement  Plan,  as such
section may be amended from time to time.

         3.  ELIGIBILITY.  An  employee of the  Corporation  will be eligible to
receive  a  benefit  pursuant  to  Section  4 of the Plan if, at the time of his
termination of employment with the Corporation, such employee (i) is at least 55
years of age, (ii) has ten (10) Years of Service,  and (iii) has participated in
the performance share unit portion of the KEIP for at least five (5) of his last
ten (10) years of  employment  with the  Corporation.  No  Participant  shall be
entitled  to receive  any  benefits  under the Plan if his  employment  with the
Corporation  is terminated  for Cause.  Notwithstanding  the above,  an employee
whose  employment  is  terminated  with  the  Corporation  prior  to his  Normal
Retirement  Date for reason of  Disability  will be treated as  provided  for in
Paragraph 4.c.

         4.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS.

Participant, and who retires (or whose employment is otherwise terminated, other
than for Cause) on or after his Normal  Retirement  Date shall be entitled under
the Plan to  receive  a  normal  retirement  benefit  which  shall be an  annual
benefit, payable in monthly installments, equal to:

         (3 2/3%) of his  Final  Average  Compensation  and his Years of Service
         not in excess of fifteen (15) Years of Service;

                           reduced by:



                                       3
<PAGE>

                           (2) one hundred  percent (100%) of the  Participant's
         retirement   benefit   under   the   Retirement   Plan  and  any  other
         tax-qualified   defined   benefit   pension  plan   maintained  by  the
         Corporation  or any affiliate  thereof or any defined  benefit  pension
         plan  maintained  by  any  other  entity,  payable  as a  life  annuity
         commencing  at his Normal  Retirement  Date or his Deferred  Retirement
         Date if he retires  after his Normal  Retirement  Date,  regardless  of
         whether  such  benefit  payment is in that form or begins at that time;
         and

                           (3) one hundred  percent (100%) of the primary social
         security  benefit to which the  Participant  would be  entitled  on his
         Normal  Retirement  Date or his Deferred  Retirement Date if he retires
         after his Normal  Retirement Date regardless of whether he receives any
         portion of such primary Social Security benefit on such date.

         Payment of such benefit shall commence on his Normal Retirement Date if
he retires (or otherwise has his employment terminated, other than for Cause) on
such date and on his Deferred  Retirement  Date if he retires (or  otherwise has
his  employment  terminated,  other than for Cause) after his Normal  Retirement
Date.

                  b. Early  Retirement  Benefit.  An employee who qualifies as a
Participant, and who retires (or whose employment is otherwise terminated, other
than for  Cause) on or after his Early  Retirement  Date and prior to his Normal
Retirement Date shall be entitled under the Plan to receive an early  retirement
benefit which shall be an annual benefit payable in monthly installments,  equal
to:

                           (1) the product of three and  two-thirds  percent
 (3 2/3%) of his Final  Average  Compensation  and his Years of Service not in
 excess of fifteen (15) Years of Service;

                           reduced by:

                           (2) one  hundred  percent  (100%)  of his  retirement
         benefit under the Retirement Plan and any other  tax-qualified  defined
         benefit  pension plan  maintained by the  Corporation  or any affiliate
         thereof or any defined  benefit  pension plan  maintained  by any other
         entity,  payable as a life annuity  commencing at his Early  Retirement
         Date or the first  date  thereafter  on which  such  benefits  would be
         payable if they are not payable on his Early Retirement Date regardless
         of whether such benefit payment is in that form or begins at that time;
         and

                           (3) one hundred  percent (100%) of the primary Social
         Security  benefit to which the  Participant  would be  entitled  on his
         Early  Retirement  Date or the  first  date  thereafter  on which  such
         benefits  would  be  payable  if they  are  not  payable  on his  Early
         Retirement  Date  regardless of whether he receives any portion of such
         primary Social Security benefit on such date; and

                           (4) the product of (a) the difference between (1) and
         the sum of (2) and (3), (b) five-twelfths of a percent (5/12%), and (c)
         the number of complete


                                       4
<PAGE>

         calendar months by which the Participant's  date of termination of
         employment precedes his sixtieth (60th) birthday.

         Payment of such  benefit  shall  commence on the first day of the month
coincident with the Participant's retirement or other termination of employment,
other than for Cause.

                  c.  Disability  Retirement  Benefit.  If an employee who is an
active  participant in the performance  share unit portion of the KEIP suffers a
Disability  prior to his  Normal  Retirement  Date  and  while  employed  by the
Corporation, the period of his Disability will be recognized as Years of Service
and as years of participation in the performance  share unit portion of the KEIP
under the Plan. If such Disability  continues to his Normal Retirement Date, for
purposes  of the Plan,  he will  retire on that date and will be  entitled  to a
normal  retirement   benefit   calculated  in  accordance  with  Paragraph  4.a.
commencing on that date. In calculating  the benefit under  Paragraph  4.a., the
Participant's  Final  Average  Compensation  shall be equal to his  annual  base
compensation  immediately  prior to his  Disability  plus the average of his AIP
earned during the three (3) years  immediately  prior to the commencement of his
Disability.

                  d. Pre-Retirement  Death Benefit. If a Participant dies before
his employment by the Corporation terminates,  his designated  beneficiary(ies),
or his estate if he has not  designated  any  beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  in
accordance  with procedures  established by the Committee,  shall receive within
ten (10) days of the  Participant's  death a death benefit equal to the lump sum
present value of one hundred percent (100%) of the retirement benefit that would
have been payable to the Participant  under  Paragraphs 4.a. or 4.b.  (including
the spousal  survivor benefit payable pursuant to Paragraph 4.e. with respect to
any  Participant  survived  by a spouse)  if he had  retired  on the date of his
death. The lump sum present value of the retirement  benefit shall be calculated
using:  (x) for each  Participant  who was a Participant on January 1, 1998, (i)
the 83 GAM  mortality  tables;  and (ii) an  interest  rate  equal to the sum of
one-twelfth  (1/12th)  of each PBGC  Interest  Rate for the twelve  (12)  months
immediately  preceding  the date of the  Participant's  death;  and (y) for each
Participant  who first  became a  Participant  after  January 1,  1998,  (i) the
prevailing   commissioner's  standard  mortality  table  (described  in  Section
807(d)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time)
used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date of the
Participant's  death (without regard to any other  subparagraph for such Section
807(d)(5))  that is  prescribed  by the  Commissioner  of the  Internal  Revenue
Service in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin;  and (ii) an interest rate equal to the Lump Sum Interest Rate
as of the date of the Participant's death.

                  e.  Post-Retirement  Death  Benefit.  If a Participant  who is
receiving monthly retirement  benefits under this Plan following his termination
of employment by the Corporation  dies, his surviving  spouse, if he is survived
by a spouse,  shall be  entitled  to receive a death  benefit  which  shall be a
monthly  payment for the spouse's life,  beginning on the first day of the month
following the Participant's death, equal to:

                                       5
<PAGE>

                           (1) fifty percent (50%) of the monthly  retirement
         benefit to which the Participant was entitled under the Plan prior to
         his death;

                           reduced by:

                           (2) the monthly  annuity value of any life  insurance
         provided  by the  Corporation  or any  affiliate  thereof  for  retired
         employees  that  is  in  excess  of  post-retirement  group  term  life
         insurance  regularly  provided  by the  Corporation  or  any  affiliate
         thereof.

         5.  ADMINISTRATION  OF THE PLAN.  The  Committee  is  charged  with the
administration  of the Plan.  It shall have full power and authority to construe
and interpret the Plan. Its decisions shall be final,  conclusive and binding on
all parties. Subject to Paragraph 10 of this Plan, the Committee shall also have
the  power,  in its sole  discretion,  at any time (i) to waive,  in whole or in
part,  application of any of the  eligibility  requirements of Paragraph 3 or of
the benefit  reduction  factors in Paragraph 4.a. and 4.b. and (ii) to determine
the timing and form of payment of any benefit under the Plan, in the case of any
individual Participant or other employee of the Corporation participating in, or
who has participated in, the performance share unit portion of the KEIP.

         6. OPTIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT. In lieu of the monthly retirement benefit
(including  the spousal  survivor  benefit  payable  pursuant to Paragraph  4.e.
hereof) payable  pursuant to Paragraph 4.a. or 4.b. hereof to a Participant (and

Participant  who was a Participant  on January 1, 1998, (i) the 83 GAM mortality
tables;  and (ii) an interest  rate equal to one  twelfth  (1/12th) of each PBGC
Interest  Rate  for the  twelve  months  immediately  preceding  the date of the
Participant's retirement (or the Participant's date of termination of employment
other than for Cause), calculated in accordance with the Corporation's practices
for  determining  retirement  benefits;  and (y) for each  Participant who first
became a  Participant  after January 1, 1998 (i) the  prevailing  commissioner's
standard  mortality  table  (described in Section  807(d)(5)(A)  of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended from time to time) used to determine  reserves
for group annuity contracts issued on the date of the  Participant's  retirement
(or the  Participant's  date of termination of employment  other than for Cause)

                  Notwithstanding   the   foregoing,   the  provisions  of  this

shall  provide  each  SERP  Recipient,  a  written  notice  of the terms of this
Paragraph 7.a. and the consent requirement  contained herein not later than five
(5) days after the  earliest  of (x) the  occurrence  of a  Potential  Change in

         nominee for director,  without  written  objection to such  nomination)
         shall be an Incumbent Director;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that no individual

         following  entities  shall  not by itself  constitute  such a Change in

         the Corporation or by any Subsidiary for the benefit of the Corporation
         and/or  its  employees  or those of a  Subsidiary;  (iii) any  employee

         (acting  with  authority)  undertakes  consideration  of any action the
         taking of which  would lead to a Change in  Control as defined  herein,
         including, but not limited to consideration of (i) an offer made to the
         Hershey  Trust to purchase any number of its shares in the  Corporation
         such that if the Hershey Trust accepted such offer and sold such number
         of shares in the  Corporation  the  Hershey  Trust might no longer have
         more than 50% of the Outstanding Company Voting Power, (ii) an offering

         subsection  (2),  (3) or (4) of the  definition  of a Change in Control

not-for-profit  corporation;  (ii)  "Exchange  Act"  shall  mean the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii)

         8.  PAYMENT OF  BENEFITS.  Nothing  contained in the Plan and no action
taken  pursuant to the  provisions  of the Plan shall  create or be construed to
create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary  relationship between the Corporation
and the  Participant,  his spouse or any other person.  No person other than the
Corporation  shall by virtue of the  provisions of the Plan have any interest in
such assets.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments
from the  Corporation  under the Plan,  such right shall be no greater  than the
right of any unsecured  general  creditor of the  Corporation.  The right of the
Participant  or any other person to the payment of benefits under the Plan shall
not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered; such payments and the right
thereto are expressly  declared to be  non-assignable  and  nontransferable.  No
payments  hereunder  shall  be  subject  to the  claim of the  creditors  of the
Participant nor of any other person entitled to payments hereunder. Any payments
required  to be made  pursuant  to the  Plan to a  person  who is  under a legal
disability  may be made by the  Corporation to or for the benefit of such person
in such of the following ways as the Committee shall determine:

                  a.       directly to such person.
                  b.       to the legal representative of such person.

                  c.       to a near relative of such person to be used for such
person's benefit.
                  d.       directly in payment of expenses of support,
maintenance or education of such person.

                   The  Corporation   shall  not  be  required  to  see  to  the
application by any third party of any payments made pursuant to the Plan.

         9.   EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  PLAN.   This  Amended  and  Restated   (1999)
Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan  shall be  effective  June 9, 1999 and
Participants  who become eligible to retire under the Plan on or after that date
shall be entitled to the benefits provided hereunder.

         10.  AMENDMENT,  SUSPENSION OR  TERMINATION  OF THE PLAN.  The Board of
Directors of the  Corporation  may, at any time,  suspend or terminate the Plan.
The Board may also from time to time,  amend the Plan in such respects as it may
deem  advisable in order that  benefits  provided  hereunder  may conform to any
change  in law or in other  respects  which  the  Board  deems to be in the best
interest of the Corporation. No such suspension, termination or amendment of the
Plan shall adversely  affect any right of any person who is a Participant at the
time of such  suspension,  termination  or  amendment  or his  beneficiary(ies),
estate or surviving spouse, as applicable, to receive benefits under the Plan in
accordance with its provisions in effect  immediately  prior to such suspension,
termination   or   amendment   without   the   consent   of  such   Participant,
beneficiary(ies),  estate or surviving  spouse.  Any benefits  payable under the
terms of the Plan at the time of any suspension, termination or amendment of the
Plan shall remain in effect according to their original terms, or such alternate
terms as may be in the best  interests  of both  parties  and  agreed  to by the
Participant or his  beneficiaries,  estate or surviving  spouse,  as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  (a) the Plan may not be terminated or amended in
any manner that is adverse to the  interests of a  Participant  or the surviving
spouse of a  Participant  without the consent of the  Participant  or  surviving
spouse,  as applicable,  either:  (i) after a Potential Change in Control occurs
and for one (1) year following the cessation of the Potential Change in Control,
or (ii) for a two year period  beginning on the date of a Change in Control (the
"Coverage Period"); and (b) no termination of this Plan or amendment hereof in a
manner adverse to the interests of any  Participant  (without the consent of the
Participant  or surviving  spouse)  shall be effective  if such  termination  or
amendment  occurs  (i) at the  request  of a third  party  who has  taken  steps
reasonably  calculated to effect a Change of Control, or (ii) in connection with
or in anticipation of a Change of Control.  After the Coverage Period,  the Plan
may not be amended or terminated in any manner that would  adversely  affect the
entitlement of a Participant or his surviving spouse (without the consent of the
Participant or surviving  spouse) to benefits that have accrued  hereunder.  For
purposes of the  immediately  preceding  two  sentences  of this  Paragraph  10,
"Participant" shall include any employee of the Corporation participating in the
performance  share unit  portion  of the KEIP  (regardless  of whether  any such
employee meets the other  eligibility  requirements  of Paragraph 3) at the time
(a) the Coverage  Period  commences  and  thereafter  or (b) his  employment  is
terminated  or the Plan is amended  (i) at the  request of a third party who has
taken steps  reasonably  calculated  to effect a Change of  Control,  or (ii) in
connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control.

January of the year first  following the year during which the Change in Control
occurs and (ii) the one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day  following the Change in
Control,  pay to each  Executive  a lump sum cash  payment  equal to his  Vested
Deferred PSU Amount  attributable to his Deferred PSU Awards not previously paid
to him in accordance with any of his applicable  Deferral  Elections if prior to
the Change in Control,  he elects, in his sole discretion,  to receive such lump
sum cash payment at such time.

                  2.3.1 each  Executive who either is a participant  in the SERP
on the date of the  Change in Control  or was a  participant  in the SERP on the
date of the  Potential  Change in Control  preceding the Change in Control shall
have a vested and  nonforfeitable  right  hereunder to receive in cash an amount
equal  to  the  actuarial  present  value  (as  determined  in  accordance  with
Subsection  2.3.1.3  hereof) of the monthly  retirement  benefit  (including the
spousal  survivor  benefit) to which he and his spouse  would be entitled  under
Section 4 of the SERP if he  retired  as of the date of the  Change in  Control,
taking into account  Subsections  2.3.1.1 and 2.3.1.2 hereof (the amount of such
monthly  retirement  benefits for him and his spouse being herein referred to as
such  Executive's  "SERP  Benefit",  the  actuarial  present  value of such SERP
Benefit being herein referred to as such  Executive's  "Vested Pension  Benefit"
and the Vested Pension  Benefit plus all investment  credits  applied thereto in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5 hereof being herein referred to as

                           2.3.1.1  for purposes of determining such Executive's
SERP  Benefit as of the date of a Change in Control,  he shall:  (i) be credited
for all purposes under the SERP with additional  Years of Service (as defined in
the SERP)  equal to the  lesser of three (3) or the  number of years  (including
fractions  thereof) from the date of the Change in Control until he would attain
Mandatory  Retirement Age if applicable to him; (ii) be credited for purposes of
Section 3 of the SERP (and not for the  purposes of any other  provision  of the
SERP,  including but not limited to Section 4) with additional  Years of Service
(as  defined  in the SERP)  equal to the  excess,  if any,  of ten (10) over his
actual number of Years of Service (including  fractions thereof) completed as of
the date of the Change in Control; (iii) be deemed for the purposes of Section 3
of the SERP (and not for the  purposes  of any other  provision  of the SERP) to
have five (5) years of  participation  in the performance  share unit portion of
the  KEIP  during  his  last  ten (10)  years  of  employment  with the  Company
regardless of his actual years of  participation  in the performance  share unit
portion of the KEIP at the time of the Change in Control; (iv) be deemed for all
purposes under the SERP  (including but not limited to clause (4) of Section 4.b
of the SERP) to have his age increased by three (3) years (or such lesser number

years (or such  lesser  number  of years  (including  fractions)  until he would
attain  Mandatory   Retirement  Age  if  applicable  to  him)  for  purposes  of
calculating "Final Average Compensation" in Section 2.f. of the SERP;


                           2.3.1.2    if such Executive has not yet attained age
fifty-five (55) (after  increasing his age by three (3) years as provided in the
preceding  Subsection  2.3.1.1),  he shall upon the  occurrence of the Change in
Control be deemed  nevertheless to have attained age fifty-five (55),  provided,
however,  the  reduction  factor  prescribed by clause (4) of Section 4.b of the
SERP shall still be given effect in calculating  his SERP Benefit,  with his age
being increased by three (3) years as provided in Subsection 2.3.1.1 hereof;

                           2.3.1.3    the actuarial present value of such
Executive's  SERP  Benefit,  as  determined  in  accordance  with the  foregoing
provisions  of this  Section  2.3  shall  be  determined  using:  (i) the 83 GAM
mortality  tables;  and (ii) an interest rate equal to 100% of the interest rate
that  would be used (as of the date of the  Change in  Control)  by the  Pension
Benefit Guaranty  Corporation for purposes of determining the present value of a
lump sum distribution on plan  termination;  and (iii) the date of the Change in
Control  as the date on which  payment  of the  Executive's  SERP  Benefit is to
commence and as the date as of which the  actuarial  present  value of such SERP
Benefit is calculated; and

                           2.3.2     each Executive who neither is a participant
in the SERP on the date of the Change in Control  nor was a  participant  in the
SERP on the date of the  Potential  Change in  Control  preceding  the Change in
Control  shall have a vested and  nonforfeitable  right  hereunder to receive in
cash an amount equal to the sum of:

                           2.3.2.1    a lump sum cash amount equal to the
actuarial  equivalent of the excess of (x) the retirement pension (determined as
a straight life annuity  commencing at Normal  Retirement Age, as defined in the
Hershey Pension Plan) which he would have accrued under the terms of the Hershey
Pension  Plan  (as in  effect  immediately  prior  to the  Change  in  Control),
determined as if he were fully vested thereunder and had accumulated  thirty-six
(36) additional months of service credit thereunder during each of which he will
be deemed to have been paid

                                       16
<PAGE>

one-twelfth  (1/12th) of the sum of his highest annual rate of compensation
as an employee of the Company and his Annual  Bonus (but in no event shall he be
deemed to have  accumulated  additional  months of service credit after he would
have attained  Mandatory  Retirement Age, if applicable) over (y) the retirement
pension  (determined as a straight life annuity  commencing at Normal Retirement
Age) which he has accrued  pursuant to the terms of the Hershey  Pension Plan as
of the date of the Change in Control; and

                           2.3.2.2    if he is a participant in the CLRP, a lump
sum cash amount ("CLRP Benefit") equal to his Excess Account,  as defined in the
CLRP (as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control)  determined as if
he were fully vested  thereunder and had accumulated  thirty-six (36) additional
months of service  credit  thereunder  during each of which he will be deemed to
have been paid  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of the sum of his  highest  annual rate of
compensation as an employee of the Company and his Annual Bonus, but in no event
shall he be deemed to have accumulated additional months of service credit after
he would have attained  Mandatory  Retirement Age, if applicable (the sum of the
amounts  described in Subsections  2.3.2.1 and 2.3.2.2 is herein  referred to as
such  Executive's  "Vested Pension  Benefit" and the Vested Pension Benefit plus
all, if any, investment credit applied thereto in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.5 hereof is herein referred to as such Executive's  "Vested Pension
Amount").

For purposes of this Subsection 2.3.2,  "actuarial  equivalent" amounts shall be
determined  using the same methods and assumptions  prescribed under the Hershey
Pension Plan immediately prior to the Change in Control.

                  2.4 PAYMENT OF VESTED PENSION AMOUNT UPON TIMELY ELECTION. The
Company  shall,  on the later of (i) the first day of  January of the year first
following  the year  during  which the  Change in  Control  occurs  and (ii) the
one-hundred  twentieth (120th) day following the Change in Control,  pay to each
Executive  a lump sum cash  payment  equal to his  Vested  Pension  Amount  plus
interest thereon at the rate provided in Section  1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from
the date of the Change in Control to the date of payment if, prior to the Change
in Control,  he elects,  in his sole  discretion,  to receive such lump sum cash
payment at such time.

                  2.5   CONVERSION  OF  VESTED   PENSION   BENEFIT  TO  DEFERRED
COMPENSATION  PLAN ACCOUNT IN ABSENCE OF SECTION 2.4 ELECTION.  In the event the
Executive  makes no election  under  Section 2.4 hereof,  an amount equal to his
Vested Pension Benefit shall be credited to him under the Deferred  Compensation
Plan and subject to the provisions of this Subsection 2.5, the provisions of the
Deferred Compensation Plan shall apply thereto as if such amount were a Deferred
AIP Award.  Within ten (10) days of the Change in Control  the  Executive  shall
select one or more  Investment  Options as defined in the Deferred  Compensation
Plan to be effective  with respect to such amount and  thereafter may change his
selection of such  Investment  Options in accordance  with the provisions of the
Deferred Compensation Plan. Investment credits shall be applied to the amount of
his Vested  Pension  Benefit in accordance  with the  provisions of the Deferred
Compensation  Plan from the date of the Change in Control to the date of payment
to the Executive in accordance with his selection of such Investment Options. If
the Executive makes no election under Section 2.4 hereof and does not select one
or more Investment  Options as defined in the Deferred  Compensation Plan within
ten (10) days of the Change in Control in accordance  with the provisions of the
second sentence of this Section 2.5,  investment credits shall be applied to the
amount of his Vested  Pension  Benefit from the date of the Change in Control to
the earlier of the date he makes a selection of Investment  Options with respect
thereto in accordance with the provisions of the Deferred  Compensation Plan and
the date of payment in accordance  with the latest of his  pre-Change in Control
selections of Investment Options relating to his Deferred AIP Awards or Deferred
PSU Awards,  if any. If there are no such  pre-Change  in Control  selections of
Investment Options,  then investment credits shall be applied in accordance with
the  provisions of the  immediately  preceding  sentence by treating the Hershey
Fixed Income Fund Investment Option under the Deferred  Compensation Plan as his
latest  pre-Change in Control selection of Investment  Options.  Within ten (10)
days of the Change in Control the Executive shall make a Deferral  Election with
respect to his Vested Pension  Amount.  If the Executive makes no election under
Section  2.4 hereof and makes no Deferral  Election  within ten (10) days of the
Change in Control in accordance with the immediately  preceding  sentence,  then
for purposes hereof he will be considered to have made a Deferral Election under
the Deferred  Compensation  Plan to have his Vested  Pension Amount paid to him,
his designated  beneficiaries or his estate,  as applicable,  in accordance with
the latest of his  pre-Change  in Control  Deferral

                                       18
<PAGE>

Elections relating to his Deferred AIP Awards or Deferred PSU Awards, if any. If
there are no such pre-Change in Control  Deferral  Elections,  then for purposes
hereof he will be considered to have made a Deferral Election under the Deferred
Compensation  Plan to have his Vested Pension Amount paid to him, his designated
beneficiaries  or his  estate,  as  applicable,  on the  first  day of the month
following  his  termination  of employment  by the Company.  His Vested  Pension
Amount shall be paid to him in accordance with the Deferral  Election  described
in the preceding  three  sentences,  as applicable,  or any subsequent  Deferral
Election with respect thereto permitted in accordance with the provisions of the
Deferred Compensation Plan.

                  2.6 SERP OR CLRP AMENDMENTS.  Notwithstanding any provision of
the SERP,  CLRP,  or Deferred  Compensation  Plan,  none of the SERP,  CLRP,  or
Deferred  Compensation  Plan may be  terminated or amended in any manner that is
adverse to the interests of any Executive without his consent either:  (i) after
a  Potential  Change  in  Control  occurs  and for one (1)  year  following  the
cessation of the Potential Change in Control, or (ii) after a Change in Control.
Any termination or amendment of the SERP, CLRP, or Deferred Compensation Plan in
a manner adverse to the interests of an Executive within one (1) year prior to a
Potential  Change in Control  shall not be given  effect for purposes of Section
2.3 or Section 2.5 hereof.

                  3.1.3 PAYMENT OF VESTED  CURRENT  BONUS AMOUNT.  Except to the

                  3.1.7 PAYMENT OF VESTED PENSION  AMOUNT.  Except to the extent
that the  Company has  previously  paid or  concurrently  pays to him his Vested

         3.2  SEVERANCE  BENEFITS.  In addition to the payments  provided for by
Section 3.1 hereof, the Company shall pay to an Executive the payments described
in  Subsections  3.2.1  through  3.2.4  below  (the  "Severance   Benefits")  in
accordance  with such  Subsections  upon  termination of his employment with the
Company (i) during the Coverage  Period,  unless such  termination is (a) by the
Company  for  Cause,  (b) by  reason  of his  death or  Disability  or after his
Mandatory  Retirement Age, if applicable,  or (c) by him without Good Reason; or
(ii) prior to his Mandatory  Retirement Age, if applicable,  but during the 13th
full calendar  month of the Coverage  Period for any reason other than his death
or Disability.

                  3.2.1  LUMP-SUM  SEVERANCE  PAYMENT.  In lieu  of any  further
salary payments to him for periods  subsequent to the Date of  Termination,  the
Company shall pay to him a lump sum severance  payment,  in cash, equal to three
(3) (or, if less,  the number of years,  including  fractions,  from the Date of
Termination until he would have reached Mandatory Retirement Age, if applicable)
times the sum of (a), (b) and (c) where (a) equals his Annual Base  Salary,  (b)
equals his Annual Bonus and (c) equals his Highest PSU Amount.

                  3.2.2 CONTINUED  BENEFITS.  For a thirty-six (36) month period
(or, if less, the number of months from the Date of  Termination  until he would
have  reached  Mandatory  Retirement  Age,  if  applicable)  after  the  Date of
Termination,  the  Company  shall  provide  him  with  life  insurance,  health,
disability and other welfare benefits ("Welfare Benefits") substantially similar
in all respects to those which he was receiving  immediately prior to the Notice
of  Termination  on  substantially  the same  terms  and  conditions,  including
contributions  required from him for such benefits (without giving effect to any
reduction  in such  benefits  subsequent  to the  Potential  Change  in  Control
preceding  the  Change in  Control or the  Change in  Control,  which  reduction
constitutes or may constitute Good Reason);  provided that if he cannot continue
to  participate in the Company plans  providing  Welfare  Benefits,  the Company
shall  otherwise  provide  such  benefits  on the  same  after-tax  basis  as if
continued  participation had been

                                       21
<PAGE>

permitted.  The  Executive  shall be  entitled  to elect to change  his level of
coverage and/or his choice of coverage options (such as Executive only or family
medical  coverage)  with  respect to the Welfare  Benefits to be provided by the
Company to him to the same  extent  that  actively  employed  executives  of the
Company are permitted to make such changes; provided, however, that in the event
of any such  changes  he shall pay the  amount of any cost  increase  that would
actually be paid by an actively  employed  executive of the Company by reason of
such actively employed  executive making the same change in level of coverage or
coverage options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive
becomes reemployed with another employer and becomes eligible to receive welfare
benefits form such  employer,  the Welfare  Benefits  described  herein shall be
secondary to such benefits,  but only to the extent that the Company  reimburses
him for any increased  cost and provides any  additional  benefits  necessary to
give him the Welfare Benefits provided hereunder.

                  3.2.3   OUTSTANDING   AWARDS.   If  an  Executive's   Date  of
Termination  occurs  within the  Coverage  Period and during any  calendar  year
following the calendar year during which a Change in Control occurs, he shall be
entitled to a lump sum cash payment with respect to each outstanding  contingent
target AIP and PSU grant under the KEIP or any similar types of grants under any
replacement plans or programs equal to the sum of :

                           3.2.3.1    the sum of the product of (x) and (y)for
each then  outstanding  contingent  target PSU grant  under the KEIP (or similar
types of grants under any replacement  plan or program) for the applicable award
period that  includes his Date of  Termination,  where (x) is an amount equal to
the 100% target award amount of such outstanding contingent target PSU grant and
(y) is a  fraction  the  numerator  of  which  is the  number  of days  from and
including  the first  day of the award  period  applicable  to such  outstanding
contingent  target PSU grant that includes the  Executive's  Date of Termination
until (and  including) his Date of Termination  and the  denominator of which is
the number of days in the award period applicable to such outstanding contingent
target PSU grant; and

                          3.2.3.2    the sum of the product of (x) and (y) for
each then outstanding contingent target AIP grant made to him under the KEIP (or
similar  types of  grants  under  any

                                       22
<PAGE>

replacement plans or programs) for the applicable award period that includes his
Date of Termination, where (x) is an amount equal to the greater of (A) the 100%
target award amount of such outstanding contingent target AIP grant, and (B) the
amount  that would have been  payable  to him under such  contingent  target AIP
grant as of the end of the applicable award period,  calculated utilizing as the
applicable  performance  factors his and the Company's actual  performance on an
annualized  basis  as of his  Date of  Termination,  and (y) is a  fraction  the
numerator of which is the number of days from and including the first day of the
award period  applicable to such outstanding  contingent AIP grant that includes
his Date of Termination  until (and  including) his Date of Termination  and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such applicable award period.

Contingent  target PSU grants  under the KEIP or a similar type of grant under a
replacement  plan or program shall be valued at the highest closing price of the
Company's  Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the period running
from sixty (60) days prior to the Change in Control until the  Executive's  Date
of Termination.

                  3.2.4  RELOCATION  ALLOWANCE.  In the event that an  Executive
relocates  following his Date of Termination  and during the Coverage  Period at
the request of a successor  employer,  the Company shall pay to him a relocation
allowance of $75,000; provided,  however, that any such payment shall be reduced
by any payments received by him from such successor  employer for the purpose of
reimbursing  him for  costs  of  relocation.  The  Company  shall  pay him  such
relocation allowance within five (5) business days after delivery of his written
request and may  condition  the  payment of the  relocation  allowance  upon his
agreeing  in  writing  to  report  to the  Company  any such  payments  from any
successor  employer  and  agreeing  in writing to  reimburse  to the Company any
amounts  received from the Company pursuant to this Subsection 3.2.4 that should
have been so reduced.

         3.3 GROSS-UP  PAYMENT.  In the event that an Executive becomes entitled
to the  Severance  Benefits or any other  benefits  or payments  under this Plan
(other  than  pursuant  to this  Section  3.3),  or the  KEIP by  reason  of the
accelerated   vesting  of  stock  options  thereunder   (together,   the  "Total
Benefits"),  and in the event that any of the Total  Benefits will be subject to

                                       23
<PAGE>

the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to him an additional amount (the "Gross-Up
Payment")  such that the net amount  retained  by him,  after  deduction  of any
Excise Tax on the Total  Benefits and any  federal,  state and local income tax,
Excise Tax and FICA and Medicare withholding taxes upon the payment provided for
by this Section 3.3, shall be equal to the Total Benefits.

         For purposes of  determining  whether any of the Total Benefits will be
subject  to the  Excise Tax and the  amount of such  Excise  Tax,  (i) any other
payments or benefits  received or to be received by an Executive  in  connection
with a Change in Control or his termination of employment  (whether  pursuant to
the terms of this Plan or any other  plan,  arrangement  or  agreement  with the
Company,  any Person whose  actions  result in a Change in Control or any Person
affiliated  with the  Company or such  Person)  shall be  treated  as  parachute
payments  within the meaning of Section  280G(b)(2) of the Code,  and all excess
parachute  payments within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as
subject to the Excise Tax,  unless in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel")
selected by the Company's  independent auditors and acceptable to the Executive,
such  other  payments  or  benefits  (in  whole or in  part)  do not  constitute
parachute  payments,  or such excess  parachute  payments  (in whole or in part)
represent  reasonable  compensation  for services  actually  rendered within the
meaning of Section  280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the Base Amount,  or are
otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax,  (ii) the amount of the Total  Benefits
which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser
of (A) the total  amount of the Total  Benefits  reduced  by the  amount of such
Total Benefits that in the opinion of Tax Counsel are not parachute payments, or
(B) the  amount of excess  parachute  payments  within  the  meaning  of Section
280G(b)(1)  (after  applying  clause  (i),  above),  and  (iii) the value of any
non-cash  benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the
Company's  independent  auditors in accordance  with the  principles of Sections
280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.  For purposes of  determining  the amount of the
Gross-Up  Payment,  an Executive  shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at
the highest  marginal  rate of federal  income  taxation in the calendar year in
which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the
highest  marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of his residence on
the Date of  Termination,  net of the  reduction  in federal  income taxes which
could be obtained from  deduction of such state and local taxes  (calculated  by
assuming  that any  reduction  under  Section  68 of the Code in the  amount  of
itemized deductions  allowable to him

                                       24
<PAGE>

applies  first to reduce the amount of such  state and local  income  taxes that
would otherwise be deductible by him).

         In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently  determined to be less
than the amount taken into account  hereunder at the time of  termination  of an
Executive's  employment,  he shall  repay to the  Company,  at the time that the
amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the
Gross-Up  Payment  attributable  to such  reduction  (plus  that  portion of the
Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax, federal, state and local income
taxes and FICA and  Medicare  withholding  taxes  imposed on the  portion of the
Gross-Up  Payment being repaid by him to the extent that such repayment  results
in a  reduction  in Excise  Tax,  FICA and  Medicare  withholding  taxes  and/or
federal,  state or local  income  taxes)  plus  interest  on the  amount of such
repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. The Company
may require an Executive to agree in writing to the repayment obligation imposed
by the preceding  sentence as a condition to receiving the Gross-Up Payment.  In
the event  that the  Excise Tax is  determined  to exceed the amount  taken into
account  hereunder at the time of the  termination of an Executive's  employment
(including  by reason of any payment the  existence or amount of which cannot be
determined  at the time of the  Gross-Up  Payment),  the  Company  shall make an
additional  Gross-Up  Payment,  determined  as previously  described,  to him in
respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by him
with  respect  to such  excess)  at the time that the  amount of such  excess is
finally determined.

         3.4      TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  The payments provided for:

                  3.4.1 in Subsections 3.1.1, 3.1.3, 3.1.5, 3.2.1 and 3.2.3, and
in Section  3.3 hereof  shall be made to an  Executive  not later than the fifth
(5th) day  following his Date of  Termination;  provided,  however,  that if the
amounts of such payments cannot be finally  determined on or before such day the
Company  shall pay to the  Executive on such day an estimate,  as  determined in
good faith by the Company,  of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay
the remainder of such payments  (together  with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following the Date of
Termination to the payment of such  remainder) as soon as the amount thereof can
be determined

                                       25

but in no  event  later  than  the  thirtieth  (30th)  day  after  the  Date  of
Termination.  In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the
amount subsequently  determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)  business day
after  demand by the Company  (together  with  interest at the rate  provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following the Date of
Termination to the payment of such remainder);

                  3.4.2 in Subsection 3.1.4 hereof shall be made to an Executive
on the later of (i) the first day of  January of the year  first  following  the
year  during  which  his Date of  Termination  occurs  and (ii) the one  hundred
twentieth  (120th) day following his Date of Termination if prior to his Date of
Termination he elects, in his sole discretion,  to receive his previously unpaid
Deferred AIP Awards at such time. In the event the Executive makes such election
and the amount of the payment  described in  Subsection  3.1.4 cannot be finally
determined on or before the later of such one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or
January 1, as  applicable,  the Company  shall pay to the  Executive on such one
hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  an  estimate,  as
determined in good faith by the Company,  of the minimum  amount of such payment
and shall pay the remainder of such payment  (together with interest at the rate
provided in Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the Code from such one hundred  twentieth
(120th) day or January 1, as  applicable,  to the payment of such  remainder) as
soon as the amount  thereof  can be  determined  but in no event  later than the
thirtieth (30th) day after such one hundred  twentieth (120th) day or January 1,
as applicable. In the event that the amount of the estimated payment exceeds the
amount subsequently  determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
loan by the Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)  business day

Section  1274(b)(2)(B)  of the Code from the one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day
following the Date of Termination or January 1, as applicable, to the payment of
such  remainder).  In the  event  the  Executive  makes  no such  election,  his
previously  unpaid  Deferred AIP Awards shall be paid in accordance with each of
his applicable Deferral Elections;

later of (i) the first  day of  January  of the year  first  following  the year
during which his Date of Termination

                                       26
<PAGE>


occurs and (ii) the one  hundred  twentieth  (120th) day  following  his Date of
Termination  if  prior  to his  Date  of  Termination  he  elects,  in his  sole
discretion,  to receive his previously  unpaid Deferred PSU Awards at such time.
In the event the  Executive  makes such  election  and the amount of the payment
provided for in Subsection  3.1.6 cannot be finally  determined on or before the
later of such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or January 1, as applicable, the
Company shall pay to the Executive on such one hundred  twentieth (120th) day or
January  1, as  applicable,  an  estimate,  as  determined  in good faith by the
Company,  of the minimum  amount of such payment and shall pay the  remainder of
such  payment   (together   with  interest  at  the  rate  provided  in  Section
1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or January
1, as  applicable,  to the  payment  of such  remainder)  as soon as the  amount
thereof can be determined  but in no event later than the  thirtieth  (30th) day
after such one hundred twentieth (120th day or January 1, as applicable.  In the
event that the amount of the estimated  payment exceeds the amount  subsequently
determined to have been due, such excess shall  constitute a loan by the Company
to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)  business day after demand by the
Company (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of
the Code  from the one  hundred  twentieth  (120th)  day  following  the Date of
Termination or January 1, as applicable, to the payment of such remainder).

                  3.4.4 in Subsection 3.1.7 shall be made to him on the later of
(i) the first day of January  following his Date of Termination and (ii) the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day following his Date of Termination if, prior to his
Date of Termination,  he elects, in his sole discretion, to receive such payment
at such time. In the event the Executive makes no such election, then his Vested
Pension Amount shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5

         3.5 REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL COSTS. The Company shall pay to an Executive
all legal fees and expenses  incurred by him as a result of a termination of his
employment  which  entitles him to any payments  under this Plan  (including all
such fees and expenses,  if any,  incurred in contesting or disputing any Notice
of Intent to  Terminate  under  Section  4.3  hereof or in  seeking to obtain or
enforce any right or benefit provided by this Plan or in connection with any tax
audit or proceeding to the extent  attributable  to the  application  of Section
4999 of the Code to any

                                       27
<PAGE>

payment or benefit provided hereunder).  Such payments shall be made within five
(5) business days after delivery of his respective  written requests for payment
accompanied  by such  evidence  of fees and  expenses  incurred  as the  Company
reasonably may require.

         3.6 EXECUTIVES' COVENANT.  The Company may condition the payment of the
amounts and  provision of the benefits  described in Article 3 of the Plan to an
Executive upon his providing to the Company a written agreement that, subject to
the terms and  conditions  of this Plan,  in the event of a Potential  Change in
Control, he will remain in the employ of the Company until the earliest of (a) a
date which is nine months  after the date of such  Potential  Change in Control,
(b) the date of a Change  in  Control,  (c) the date of his  termination  of his
employment  for Good Reason  (determined  by treating  the  Potential  Change in
Control for this  purpose as a Change in Control in applying the  definition  of
Good Reason) or by reason of death or  Disability,  (d) the  termination  by the
Company of his  employment  for any reason or (e) his attaining  age  sixty-five
(65).

                           COMPENSATION DURING DISPUTE

         4.1  NOTICE OF  INTENT TO  TERMINATE.  After a Change in  Control,  any
purported  termination  of an  Executive's  employment  (other than by reason of
death) must be preceded by a written  Notice of Intent to Terminate  from him to
the Company or the Company to him, as  applicable,  in  accordance  with Section
8.17 hereof.  For  purposes of this Plan, a Notice of Intent to Terminate  shall
mean a notice which shall indicate the notifying  party's opinion  regarding the
specific provisions of this Plan that will apply upon such termination and shall
set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances  claimed to provide a
basis for the application of the provisions so indicated.  Further,  a Notice of
Intent to Terminate for Cause is required to include a copy of a resolution duly
adopted by the  affirmative  vote of not less than  three-quarters  (3/4) of the
entire  membership  of the Board at a meeting of the Board  which was called and
held for the purpose of considering such termination (after reasonable notice to
the Executive and an

                                       28
<PAGE>

opportunity  for him,  together with his counsel,  to be heard before the Board)
finding that,  in the good faith opinion of the Board,  he was guilty of conduct
set forth in Subsection  1.6.1 or 1.6.2 herein,  and specifying the  particulars
thereof in detail.

         4.2 DATE OF  TERMINATION.  Date of  Termination  , with  respect to any
purported  termination of an Executive's  employment  after a Change in Control,
shall mean (except as provided in Section 4.3 hereof) (a) if his  employment  is
terminated  by reason of his death,  his date of death (b) if his  employment is
terminated for Disability,  thirty (30) days after Notice of Intent to Terminate
is given (provided that he shall not have returned to the full-time  performance
of his duties during such thirty (30) day period),  and (c) if his employment is
terminated  for any other reason,  the date specified in the Notice of Intent to
Terminate  (which (i) in the case of a termination by the Company,  shall not be
less than thirty  (30) days,  except in the case of a  termination  for Cause in
which case it shall not be less than ten (10) days,  provided  that the  Company
may  require  him to not report to work during such ten (10) day period and (ii)
in the case of a  termination  by an  Executive,  shall not be less than fifteen
(15) days nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice
of Intent to Terminate is given).

         4.3 DISPUTE CONCERNING  TERMINATION.  If within fifteen (15) days after
any Notice of Intent to Terminate is given (within eight (8) days in the case of
a  termination  for Cause by the  Company),  or, if later,  prior to the Date of
Termination  (as  determined  without  regard to this Section  4.3),  the person
receiving  such Notice of Intent to Terminate  notifies  the person  giving such
notice that a dispute  exists  concerning  the  termination or the provisions of
this Plan that apply to such  termination,  the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which  the  dispute  is  finally  resolved,  either  by  mutual  written
agreement of the parties to such dispute or by a final judgment, order or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
which  the  time  for  appeal  therefrom  has  expired  and no  appeal  has been
perfected); provided, however, that the Date of Termination shall be extended by
a notice of  dispute  only if such  notice is given in good faith and the person
giving such notice  pursues  the  resolution  of such  dispute  with  reasonable
diligence.

         4.4  COMPENSATION  DURING  DISPUTE.  If a purported  termination  of an
Executive's employment occurs following a Change in Control and such termination
or the  provisions of this Plan that apply upon such  termination is disputed in
accordance  with Section 4.3 hereof  (including a dispute as to the existence of
good faith and/or reasonable diligence  thereunder),  the Company shall continue
to pay the  Executive  the full  compensation  (including,  but not  limited to,
salary)  at his  Annual  Base  Salary  and  continue  his  participation  in all
compensation  plans required to be maintained  hereunder and continue to provide
to him the Welfare  Benefits  provided for in Subsection  3.2.2 hereof until the
dispute is finally resolved in accordance with Section 4.3 hereof.  Amounts paid
under this Section 4.4 are in addition to all other  amounts due under this Plan
(other  than those due under  Subsection  3.1.1  hereof) and shall not be offset
against or reduce any other amounts due under this Plan.

                                     CLAIMS

         6.1 CLAIMS PROCEDURE. Claims for benefits under the Plan shall be filed
with the Plan  Administrator.  If any  Executive  or other  payee  claims  to be
entitled to a benefit under the Plan and the Plan Administrator  determines that
such claim should be denied in whole or in part,  the Plan  Administrator  shall
notify such person of its decision in writing. Such notification will be written
in a manner  calculated  to be  understood  by such person and will  contain (a)
specific  reasons for the denial,  (b)  specific  reference  to  pertinent  Plan
provisions,  (c)  a  description  of  any  additional  material  or  information
necessary for such person to perfect such claim and an  explanation  of why such
material or information is necessary,  and (d) information as to the steps to be
taken if the person  wishes to submit a request  for review.  Such  notification
will  be  given  within  90  days  after  the  claim  is  received  by the  Plan
Administrator.  If such notification is not given within such period,  the claim
will be considered  denied as of the last day of such period and such person may
request a review of his claim.

         6.2 REVIEW  PROCEDURE.  Within 60 days after the date on which a person
receives a written notice of a denied claim (or, if  applicable,  within 60 days
after the date on which such denial is considered to have  occurred) such person
(or his duly authorized  representative) may (a) file a written request with the
Plan  Administrator for a review of his denied claim and of pertinent  documents
and (b) submit written issues and comments to the Plan  Administrator.  The Plan
Administrator  will  notify  such  person  of  its  decision  in  writing.  Such
notification  will be written in a manner  calculated  to be  understood by such
person and will  contain  specific  reasons for the decision as well as specific
references  to pertinent  Plan  provisions.  The decision on review will be made
within  60  days  after  the   request  for  review  is  received  by  the  Plan
Administrator.  If the  decision on review is not made within such  period,  the
claim will be considered denied.

         6.3 CLAIMS AND REVIEW  PROCEDURES NOT MANDATORY.  The claims  procedure
and review procedure provided for in this Article 6 are provided for the use and
benefit of Executives who

                                       31
<PAGE>

may choose to use such  procedures,  but compliance  with the provisions of this
Article 6 is not mandatory for any Executive  claiming  benefits under the Plan.
It  shall  not be  necessary  for any  Executive  to file a claim  with the Plan
Administrator  or to exhaust the  procedures  and remedies  provided for by this
Article 6 prior to bringing any legal claim or action,  or  asserting  any other
demand, for payments or other benefits to which he claims entitlement hereunder.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                        PLAN MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION

         The Plan may be amended or terminated by resolution of the Board at any
time; provided,  however, that: (a) Schedule I hereto may be amended at any time
and in any manner by resolution of the Compensation  Committee of the Board upon
recommendation  of the Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer;  and (b) Schedule I
hereto may be amended at any time by the Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer to
delete any one or more persons therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the
Plan may not be  terminated  or amended in a manner  adverse to the interests of
any Executive, without his consent (including the amendment of Schedule I hereto
to delete him therefrom) (i) after a Potential  Change in Control occurs and for
one (1) year following the cessation of a Potential  Change in Control,  or (ii)
for the two-year period following  consummation of the transaction(s)  resulting
from or in the  Change  in  Control;  and  (b) no  termination  of this  Plan or
amendment hereof in a manner adverse to the interests of any Executive,  without
his  consent  (including  the  amendment  of  Schedule  I hereto to  delete  him
therefrom),  shall be effective if such  termination or amendment  occurs (i) at
the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect
a Change in Control or (ii) in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control or Potential  Change in Control.  For this  purpose,  the cessation of a
Potential  Change in  Control  occurs if a Change in  Control  has not  occurred
within one year following the Potential Change in Control. In the event that the
termination  of this  Plan by the  Company  or an  amendment  hereof in a manner
adverse to the  interests of any Executive  (without his consent)  occurs within
six (6) months  prior to a  Potential  Change in Control or a Change in Control,
there shall be a presumption  that the  conditions of subclauses (i) and (ii) of
clause  (b) of the  next  preceding  sentence  shall  have  been  met.  Upon the


                                       32
<PAGE>

expiration  of the  Coverage  Period,  the Plan may not be amended in any manner
which would adversely  affect the rights which any Executive has at that time to
receive any and all  payments  or  benefits  pursuant to Articles 2, 3, and 4 by
reason of a Change in Control which has  theretofore  occurred or by reason of a
termination  of his  employment  during the Coverage  Period,  and the Company's
obligations  to make such payments and provide such  benefits  shall survive any
termination of the Plan.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         8.1  TERMINATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF CHANGE IN CONTROL.  An Executive's
employment  shall be deemed to have been terminated by the Company without Cause
during the  Coverage  Period if his  employment  is  terminated  by the  Company
without  Cause prior to a Change in Control or  Potential  Change in Control and
such  termination  of employment (a) was at the request of a third party who had
indicated  an  intention  to take or had taken steps  reasonably  calculated  to
effect a Change in Control,  or (b)  otherwise  arose in  connection  with or in
anticipation  of a Change in Control and (c) in either case, a Change in Control
does occur which may involve  such third party (or a party  competing  with such
third party to effectuate a Change in Control).  An Executive shall be deemed to
have  terminated his employment for Good Reason during the Coverage Period if he
terminates  his  employment  with Good  Reason  prior to a Change in  Control or
Potential Change in Control if the circumstance or event which  constitutes Good
Reason  (a)  occurred  at the  request  of a third  party who had  indicated  an
intention to take or had taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in
Control,  or (b) otherwise  arose in  connection  with or in  anticipation  of a
Change in Control,  and (c) in either case, a Change in Control does occur which
may  involve  such third  party (or a party  competing  with such third party to
effectuate a Change in Control).  In the event of a  termination  of  employment
described in this Section 8.1, the  Executive  shall be entitled to all payments
and other  benefits to which he would have been  entitled  had such  termination
occurred  during the Coverage  Period (other than salary  pursuant to Subsection
3.1.1 hereof for any period after the actual date of  termination)  and he shall
be entitled to an additional  payment in an amount which shall compensate him to
the

                                       33
<PAGE>


extent that he was  deprived by such  termination  of the  opportunity  prior to
termination of employment to exercise any stock options granted to him under the
KEIP  (including any such stock options that were not exercisable at the time of
his  termination  of  employment)  at the highest  market price of the Company's
Common  Stock  reached in  connection  with the  Change in Control or  Potential
Change in  Control  if a  Potential  Change in  Control  shall  occur and not be
followed  by a Change in Control  within  twelve  (12)  months of the  Potential
Change in  Control.  In the  event  that the  termination  of  employment  of an
Executive as described in this Section 8.1 occurs  following a Potential  Change
in Control or within six (6) months prior to a Change in Control, there shall be
a  presumption  that  clauses  (a) and (b) of the  first two  sentences  of this
Section 8.1 shall have been met.

         8.2  BURDEN.  In  any  proceeding  (regardless  of who  initiates  such
proceeding) in which the payment of Severance  Benefits or other compensation or
benefits  under  this Plan is at issue,  (i) the  burden of proof as to  whether
Cause exists for purposes of this Plan shall be upon the Company and (ii) in the
event that the last sentence of Section 8.1 applies,  the Company shall have the
burden to  prove,  by clear  and  convincing  evidence,  that a  termination  of
employment  has  not  been  made in  anticipation  of a  Change  in  Control  as
contemplated by Section 8.1.

         8.3 NO RIGHT TO  CONTINUED  EMPLOYMENT.  Nothing  in the Plan  shall be
deemed to give any  Executive  the  right to be  retained  in the  employ of the
Company,  or to interfere  with the right of the Company to discharge him at any
time and for any lawful reason, with or without notice,  subject in all cases to
the terms of this Plan.

         8.4 NO ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS.  Except as otherwise  provided herein or
by law, no right or interest of any Executive under the Plan shall be assignable
or transferable,  in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or
otherwise,   including  without  limitation  by  execution,  levy,  garnishment,
attachment, pledge or in any manner; no attempted assignment or transfer thereof
shall be  effective;  and no right or interest of any  Executive  under the Plan
shall be liable  for,  or  subject  to,  any  obligation  or  liability  of such
Executive.

                                       34

         8.5 DEATH.  This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable
by an Executive's personal or legal representatives,  executors, administrators,
successors,  heirs,  distributees,  devisees and legatees. If an Executive shall
die while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder (other than amounts
which,  by their terms,  terminate  upon his death) if he had continued to live,
all such amounts,  unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
with the  terms  of this  Plan to the  executors,  personal  representatives  or
administrators of his estate.

         8.6  INCOMPETENCY.  Any  benefit  payable  to or for the  benefit of an
Executive,  if legally  incompetent  or incapable of giving a receipt  therefor,
shall be deemed  paid when paid to his  guardian  or to the party  providing  or
reasonably  appearing  to provide  for his care,  and such  payment  shall fully
discharge the Company, the Plan Administrator and all other parties with respect
thereto.

         8.7 REDUCTION OF BENEFITS BY LEGALLY REQUIRED BENEFITS. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Company is obligated by
law or by  contract  (other  than  under  this  Plan) to pay  severance  pay,  a
termination  indemnity,  notice  pay,  or the like,  to an  Executive  or if the
Company  is  obligated  by law or by  contract  to  provide  advance  notice  of
separation  ("Notice  Period")  to an  Executive,  then any  Severance  Benefits
payable to him  hereunder  shall be reduced by the amount of any such  severance
pay, termination  indemnity,  notice pay or the like, as applicable,  and by the
amount of any pay received during any Notice Period;  provided however, that the
period  following  a Notice of Intent to  Terminate  shall not be  considered  a
Notice Period.

         8.8   ENFORCEABILITY.  If any provision of the Plan shall be held
invalid or unenforceable,  such invalidity or unenforceability  shall not affect
any other provisions  hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if
such provisions had not been included.

         8.9   EFFECTIVE DATE.  The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective
Date and shall  remain in effect  unless  and  until  terminated  by the  Board,
subject to the requirements of Article 7 hereof.

         8.10  NO  MITIGATION.  The  Company  agrees  that,  if  an  Executive's
employment  by the  Company  is  terminated  during  the  Coverage  Period,  the
Executive is not required to seek other  employment  or to attempt in any way to
reduce any amounts payable to him by the Company pursuant to this Plan. Further,
the amount of any payment or benefit provided for under this Plan (other than to
the extent provided in Subsections  3.2.2 and 3.2.4) shall not be reduced by any
compensation  earned by him as a result of  employment by another  employer,  by
retirement  benefits,  by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by him to
the Company, or otherwise.

         8.11 SUCCESSORS. In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any
successor  to the  Company,  the  Company  shall be  obligated  to  require  any
successor  (whether  direct or  indirect,  by purchase,  merger,  consolidation,
operation  of law, or  otherwise)  to all or  substantially  all of the business
and/or  assets of the  Company to  expressly  assume  and agree to  perform  the
Company's  obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company  would be required to perform  them if no such  succession  had
taken  place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such  assumption  and  agreement
prior to the  effectiveness  of any such succession shall entitle each Executive
to compensation and benefits from the Company in the same amount and on the same
terms  as he  would  be  entitled  to  hereunder  if he  were to  terminate  his
employment for Good Reason during the Coverage Period.

         8.12 CONSENT TO  CANCELLATION  OF AWARDS AND REDUCTION OF SERP BENEFIT.
The Company may  condition  the payment to an  Executive  of his Vested  Current
Bonus Amount,  Vested  Current PSU Amount,  Vested  Deferred Bonus Amount and/or
Vested  Deferred  PSU  Amount  upon  his  providing  a  written  consent  to the
cancellation of the applicable  contingent target AIP and PSU grants and AIP and
PSU Awards for which payment has been deferred on which his Vested Current Bonus
Amount,  Vested Current PSU Amount,  Vested  Deferred Bonus Amount and/or Vested
Deferred  PSU Amount is based and in lieu of which such  amounts  are paid.  The
Company may condition the payment to an Executive of his Vested  Pension  Amount
or the providing of any benefit or payment under Section 2.5 or Subsection 3.4.4
hereof upon his providing a written consent to, as applicable, (i) the reduction
of the  benefit  to be paid  under  the SERP  (whether  in the form of a monthly
payment to him and his surviving  spouse or

                                       36
<PAGE>

as a lump sum) such  reduction to be in the amount of the SERP Benefit which was
used in the  calculation  of his  Vested  Pension  Benefit  or the amount of any
payments or benefits  provided under Subsection  3.4.4, or (ii) the reduction of
his Excess  Account  under the CLRP,  such  reduction to be in the amount of the
CLRP Benefit which was used in the calculation of his Vested Pension Benefit.

         8.13 EMPLOYMENT BY SUBSIDIARY.  For purposes of this Plan, an Executive
who is employed by a  Subsidiary  shall be treated as if employed by the Company
and his  entitlement  to benefits  hereunder  shall be  determined as if he were
employed by the Company. For such purpose, the Subsidiary shall be treated as if
it were an unincorporated division of the Company.

         8.14 WAIVER. No waiver by an Executive at any time of any breach of the
terms of this Plan, or compliance  with, any condition or provision of this Plan
to be performed by the Company shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar
provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.

         8.15  WITHHOLDING TAXES.  Any payments to an Executive provided for
hereunder  shall  be  paid  net of any  applicable  withholding  required  under
federal,  state  or local  law and any  additional  withholding  to which he has
agreed.

         8.16  CONSTRUCTION.  The headings and captions  herein are provided for
reference and  convenience  only,  shall not be considered part of the Plan, and
shall not be employed in the  construction  of the Plan.  Neither the gender nor
the  number  (singular  or plural)  of any word  shall be  construed  to exclude
another gender or number when a different gender or number would be appropriate.

         8.17 NOTICES.  Any notice or other communication  required or permitted
pursuant  to the terms  hereof  shall be deemed  to have  been duly  given  when
delivered  or  mailed by United  States  Mail,  first  class,  postage  prepaid,

                           HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OPERATING RESULTS

  The Corporation's sales decreased in 1999, following a record performance in
1998. During the two-year period, net sales decreased at a compound annual
rate of 4%. The sales decrease reflected the divestiture of the Corporation's
pasta business in January 1999 and reduced 1999 shipments in the United States
of confectionery and grocery products, which more than offset higher sales for
core confectionery and grocery brands in 1998. The reduction in shipments
resulted primarily from difficulties in order fulfillment (customer service,
warehousing, and shipping) encountered since the start-up of a new integrated
information system and new business processes during the third quarter of
1999. The sales decrease was partially offset by incremental sales from the
introduction of new confectionery products, and to a lessor extent, sales
increases in the Canadian and Mexican markets.

  The Corporation's income increased in 1999 reflecting the gain on the sale
of the Corporation's pasta business. Excluding the $165.0 million after-tax
gain on the sale of the pasta business, net income decreased in 1999 following
a record performance in 1998. During the two-year period, net income decreased
at a compound annual rate of 6%. The decrease in net income reflected the
divestiture of the pasta business and sales decline in 1999, and a lower gross
margin over the two-year period, partly the result of higher costs associated
with the order fulfillment difficulties noted above. These items were
partially offset by lower levels of selling and marketing, administrative and
interest expenses.

  The following divestiture occurred during the period:

 . January 1999--The completion of the sale of a 94% majority interest of the
  Corporation's U.S. pasta business to New World Pasta, LLC. The transaction
  included the AMERICAN BEAUTY, IDEAL BY SAN GIORGIO, LIGHT 'N FLUFFY, MRS.
  WEISS, P&R, RONZONI, SAN GIORGIO and SKINNER pasta brands, along with six
  manufacturing plants. In the first quarter of 1999, the Corporation received
  cash proceeds of $450.0 million, retained a 6% minority interest and
  recorded a gain of approximately $243.8 million before tax, $165.0 million
  or $1.17 per share--diluted after tax, as a result of the transaction.

Net Sales

  Net sales decreased $464.7 million or 10% in 1999 following an increase in
1998 of $133.4 million or 3%. The decrease in 1999 was primarily a result of
the divestiture of the Corporation's pasta business, resulting in a sales
reduction of $343.8 million, and sales decreases in the United States of core
confectionery and grocery products. Sales of confectionery and grocery
products declined in the first quarter of 1999 primarily as a result of the
December 1998 buy-in on promotions of regular count and vending items. Sales
decreases in the third and fourth quarters were primarily the result of
problems encountered since the July start-up of new business systems and
processes. These sales declines were partially offset by incremental sales
from the introduction of new confectionery products, increased export sales in
international markets and sales increases in the Corporation's Canadian and
Mexican markets. The increase in 1998 was primarily a result of incremental
sales from the introduction of new confectionery products and increased sales
volume for core confectionery and grocery products in North America. These
increases were offset somewhat by a decline in sales in the Corporation's
Asian and Russian markets and the impact of currency exchange rates in the
Canadian and Mexican markets, in addition to higher levels of confectionery
unsalables and lower sales of pasta products.

Costs and Expenses

  Cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased from 57.9% in 1997 to
59.2% in 1998, and to 59.3% in 1999. The decrease in gross margin in 1999
reflected lower profitability resulting from the mix of confectionery items
sold in 1999 compared with sales during 1998, primarily related to lower sales
of

                                      A-1
<PAGE>

the more profitable standard bars. Higher freight and distribution costs,
reflecting increased costs related to the implementation of new business
systems and processes and distribution center capacity constraints, and higher
depreciation expense as a percent of sales, also contributed to the lower
gross margin. These cost increases were offset partially by selling price
increases in the Corporation's Canadian and Mexican markets and decreased
costs for packaging materials and certain raw materials. The decrease in gross
margin in 1998 was principally the result of higher costs for certain major
raw materials, primarily milk and cocoa, labor and overhead, higher shipping
and distribution costs and the mix of non-chocolate and chocolate
confectionery items sold in 1998 compared to 1997. These cost increases were
partially offset by lower costs for certain raw materials and improved
manufacturing efficiencies, including significant improvements in plants
acquired with the Leaf confectionery business in December 1996, from an
affiliate of Huhtamaki Oy.

  Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased by 9% in 1999,
reflecting lower expenses resulting from the divestiture of the pasta
business, reduced marketing expenses for core confectionery brands and lower
administrative expenses. These decreases were offset partially by increased
spending associated with the introduction of new products and international
exports, in addition to higher amortization expense for capitalized software.
Excluding the divestiture of the pasta business, advertising and promotion
expense was essentially equal to the prior year as a percent of sales.
Selling, marketing and administrative costs decreased by 1% in 1998, as
reduced marketing expenses for existing brands, lower selling expenses in
international markets and lower administrative expenses were only partially
offset by higher marketing expenses associated with the introduction of new
products.

  During the first quarter of 1999, the Corporation changed its retiree
medical plan to eliminate coverage for all eligible hourly employees under age
45, to be replaced by annual contributions into the Employee Savings Stock
Investment and Ownership Plan (ESSIOP). The change applied primarily to U.S.
hourly employees working in Pennsylvania. This change resulted in the
recognition of a $15.4 million pre-tax gain in 1999, excluding contributions
to the ESSIOP. Effective December 1998, all U.S. full-time salaried employees,
and all non-union hourly plant employees working outside Hershey, Pennsylvania
under age 45 were eligible for the ESSIOP contributions, resulting in the
recognition of a $13.0 million pre-tax gain in 1998.

Interest Expense, Net

  Net interest expense in 1999 was $11.4 million below the prior year,
primarily as a result of lower short-term interest expense as a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of the pasta business and positive cash flow was used
to reduce short-term borrowings. Net interest expense in 1998 exceeded the
prior year by $9.4 million, primarily as a result of increased borrowings
associated with the purchase of Common Stock from the Hershey Trust Company,
as Trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (Milton Hershey School
Trust), partially offset by lower interest expense reflecting reduced average
short-term borrowings.


Provision for Income Taxes

  The Corporation's effective income tax rate was 39.3%, 38.8% and 36.8% in
1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Excluding the provision for income taxes
associated with the gain on the sale of the pasta business, the effective
income tax rate was 39.0% in 1999. The rate decreased from 39.3% in 1997 to
38.8% in 1998 primarily due to changes in the mix of the Corporation's income
among various tax jurisdictions.

Net Income

  Net income increased $119.4 million in 1999, reflecting an after-tax gain of
$165.0 million on the sale of the Corporation's pasta business. Excluding the
gain, net income decreased $45.6 million or 13%

                                      A-2
<PAGE>

in 1999, following an increase of $4.6 million or 1% in 1998. Excluding the
gain on the sale of the pasta business, net income as a percent of net sales
was 7.4% in 1999, 7.7% in 1998 and 7.8% in 1997.

FINANCIAL POSITION

  The Corporation's financial position remained strong during 1999. The
capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a percent of
stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was 50% as of December
31, 1999 and 54% as of December 31, 1998. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities was 1.8:1 as of December 31, 1999, and 1.4:1 as of
December 31, 1998. The lower capitalization ratio as of December 31, 1999, and
the higher ratio of current assets to current liabilities primarily reflected
the use of a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the pasta business to
reduce short-term borrowings.

Assets

  Total assets decreased $57.4 million or 2% as of December 31, 1999,
primarily as a result of the divestiture of the pasta business and lower
accounts receivable, substantially offset by increases in inventories and cash
and cash equivalents.

  Current assets increased by $146.0 million or 13% reflecting increased
inventories, cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other current
assets. An increase in inventories of $109.0 million primarily reflected
higher raw material and finished goods inventories. The increase in cash and
cash equivalents resulted from higher cash collections from customers in
December compared to the prior year and year 2000 contingency plans. A
decrease in accounts receivable reflected lower sales and increased
collections from customers in December, as well as a reduction of accounts
receivable with extended payment terms as of December 31, 1999.

  As of December 31, 1999, accounts receivable included increased deductions
from customer invoices and higher past due amounts as compared to the prior
year. These increases were primarily the result of shipping, billing and
processing difficulties encountered during the third and fourth quarters
associated with the July start-up of the new integrated information system and
new business processes. The Corporation has made substantial progress in
resolving these problems, clearing open deductions and collecting past due
receivables.

  Property, plant and equipment was lower than the prior year primarily due to
the divestiture of the pasta business and depreciation expense of $135.6
million, partially offset by capital additions of $115.4 million. The increase
in other non-current assets was primarily associated with the capitalization
of software.


Liabilities

  Total liabilities decreased by $113.8 million or 5% as of December 31, 1999,
primarily reflecting a reduction of short-term borrowings and the divestiture
of the pasta business, partially offset by an increase in accrued income
taxes. The decrease in short-term debt of $136.7 million resulted from the use
of a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the pasta business and positive
cash flow to repay commercial paper borrowings. The increase in accrued income
taxes of $54.7 million primarily reflected the income tax provision on the
gain on sale of the pasta business.

Capital Structure

  The Corporation has two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock (Class B Stock). Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B
Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to
stockholders, including the election of directors, with the

                                      A-3
<PAGE>

Common Stock having one vote per share and the Class B Stock having ten votes
per share. However, the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is
entitled to elect one-sixth of the Board of Directors. With respect to
dividend rights, the Common Stock is entitled to cash dividends 10% higher
than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock.

LIQUIDITY

  Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been cash
generated from operations. The Corporation's income and, consequently, cash
provided from operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales
patterns, the timing of new product introductions, business acquisitions and
divestitures, and price increases. Chocolate, confectionery and grocery
seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the
third and fourth quarters of the year, representing the principal seasonal
effect. Generally, seasonal working capital needs peak during the summer
months and have been met by issuing commercial paper.

  Over the past three years, cash requirements for share repurchases, capital
expenditures, capitalized software additions and dividend payments exceeded
cash provided from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of the
pasta business by $102.9 million. Total debt, including debt assumed,
increased during the period by $119.6 million. Cash and cash equivalents
increased by $56.7 million during the period.

  The Corporation anticipates that capital expenditures will be in the range
of $150 million to $170 million per annum during the next several years as a
result of continued modernization of existing facilities and capacity
expansion to support new products and line extensions. As of December 31,
1999, the Corporation's principal capital commitments included manufacturing
capacity expansion, modernization and efficiency improvements.

  In January 1999, the Corporation implemented the first phase of an
enterprise-wide integrated information system in the United States. The first
phase of system implementation included new business systems and processes
related to purchasing, accounts payable, fixed assets, the general ledger,
production reporting, and tracking of plant inventories. The start-up of the
second phase of system implementation began in July 1999 and included systems
and processes in the areas of sales order and billing, transportation planning
and management, electronic data interchange communications with warehouses,
finished goods inventories, accounts receivable and tracking of marketing
promotions. As of December 31, 1999, approximately $98.8 million of
capitalized software and hardware and $13.2 million of expenses were incurred
for the enterprise-wide information system and related projects. Total
commitments for these systems are expected to be approximately $115 million to
$120 million, including incremental costs to resolve problems encountered with
new business systems and processes. These expenditures were financed with cash
provided from operations and short-term borrowings.

  In July 1999, the Corporation entered into an operating lease agreement for
an amount not to exceed $65 million for the purpose of financing construction
costs of a warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the
Corporation near Hershey, Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor pays
for the construction costs and thereafter leases the facility to the
Corporation. The lease term is six years, including the construction period.
The lease may be extended at the Corporation's option for up to four renewal
periods of five years each. The lease provides for a substantial residual
guarantee and includes an option to purchase the facility at original cost.
The first phase of the distribution center is expected to open in the second
quarter of 2000.

  During 1999, 5,478,379 shares of Common Stock were repurchased for $318.0
million under share repurchase programs, including 1,579,779 shares purchased
from the Milton Hershey School Trust for $100.0 million. Under share
repurchase programs which began in 1993, a total of 15,339,498 shares of

                                      A-4
<PAGE>

Common Stock have been repurchased for approximately $605.6 million. Of the
shares repurchased, 528,000 shares were retired, 1,320,781 shares were
reissued to satisfy stock options obligations, Supplemental Retirement
Contributions and employee stock ownership trust (ESOP) obligations and the
remaining 13,490,717 shares were held as Treasury Stock as of December 31,
1999. Additionally, the Corporation has purchased a total of 28,000,536 shares
of its Common Stock to be held as Treasury Stock from the Milton Hershey
School Trust for $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 1999, a total of 41,491,253
shares were held as Treasury Stock and $24.4 million remained available for
repurchases of Common Stock under the program approved by the Corporation's
Board of Directors in February 1999. In October 1999, the Corporation's Board
of Directors approved an additional share repurchase program authorizing the
repurchase of up to $200 million of the Corporation's Common Stock.

  In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes under a
November 1993 Form S-3 Registration Statement. In August 1997, the Corporation
filed another Form S-3 Registration Statement under which it could offer, on a
delayed or continuous basis, up to $500 million of additional debt securities.
Also in August 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes due
2012 and $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 under the November 1993 and
August 1997 Registration Statements. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used
to repay a portion of the short-term borrowings associated with the purchase
of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. As of December 31, 1999,
$250 million of debt securities remained available for issuance under the
August 1997 Registration Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250
million of debt securities available under the shelf registration may be used
for general corporate requirements which include reducing existing commercial
paper borrowings, financing capital additions and share repurchases, and
funding future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.

  As of December 31, 1999, the Corporation maintained a committed credit
facility agreement with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $500.0 million
which could be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial
paper. The Corporation has the option to increase the credit facility by $1.0
billion with the concurrence of the banks. In December 1999, the short-term
credit facility agreement was renewed for a total of $200 million and the
long-term committed credit facility agreement remained in effect for $300
million, expiring in December 2002. The credit facilities may be used to fund
general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in
certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions. The Corporation
also had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks of
$25.0 million and $23.0 million as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Cash Flow Activities

  Cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.2 billion during the past
three years. Over this period, cash used by or provided from accounts
receivable and inventories has tended to fluctuate as a result of sales during
December and inventory management practices. The change in cash required for
or provided from other assets and liabilities between the years was primarily
related to commodities transactions, the timing of payments for accrued
liabilities, including income taxes, and variations in the funding status of
pension plans.

  Investing activities included capital additions and a business divestiture.
Capital additions during the past three years included the purchase of
manufacturing equipment, and expansion and modernization of existing
facilities. In 1999, the Corporation's pasta business was sold for $450
million in cash.

  Financing activities included debt borrowings and repayments, payment of
dividends, the exercise of stock options, incentive plan transactions and the
repurchase of Common Stock. During the past three years, short-term borrowings
in the form of commercial paper or bank borrowings were used to

                                      A-5
<PAGE>

fund seasonal working capital requirements, share repurchase programs and
purchases of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. The proceeds
from the issuance of long-term debt were used to reduce short-term borrowings.
During the past three years, a total of 15,802,718 shares of Common Stock have
been repurchased for $841.8 million, including 11,480,769 shares purchased
from the Milton Hershey School Trust for $600.0 million. Cash requirements for
incentive plan transactions were $57.5 million during the past three years,
substantially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options of
$52.6 million. Cash used by incentive plan transactions in 1997 and 1998
reflected purchases of the Corporation's Common Stock in the open market to
repurchase Common Stock issued for stock options exercises. Beginning in early
1998, shares of treasury stock were reissued for stock options exercises.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

  The Corporation utilizes certain derivative instruments, including interest
rate swaps and forward agreements, foreign currency forward exchange contracts
and commodity futures contracts, to manage interest rate, currency exchange
rate and commodity market price risk exposures. The interest rate swaps and
forward agreements, and foreign currency contracts are entered into for
periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute
positions independent of those exposures. Commodity futures contracts are
entered into for varying periods and are intended and effective as hedges of
anticipated raw material purchases. The Corporation does not hold or issue
derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any
instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these
contracts, the Corporation has assumed the risk which might arise from the
possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
Corporation does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

  The information below summarizes the Corporation's market risks associated
with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31,
1999. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Note 5, Note
7 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-Term Debt

  The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates
by maturity date for long-term debt as of December 31, 1999. The fair value of
long-term debt was determined based upon quoted market prices for the same or
similar debt issues.

</TABLE>

Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Agreements

  In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap
agreements. In October 1999, the Corporation entered into an interest rate
swap agreement to effectively convert $200 million of 6.7% Notes Due 2005
(Notes) to variable rate debt. The interest rate swap agreement is cancelable
at the sole discretion of the counterparty effective April 2, 2001. At the
same time, the Corporation entered into forward interest rate agreements to
fix the interest rate on the Notes at 5.8% through April 2, 2001.
Subsequently, if the counterparty chooses not to cancel the agreement, the
interest rate on the Notes would be variable based on the London InterBank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) until expiration on October 1, 2005.

                                      A-6
<PAGE>

  As of December 31, 1998, the Corporation had agreements outstanding with an
aggregate notional amount of $75.0 million maturing in September 1999 to
effectively convert a portion of its floating rate commercial paper borrowings
to fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 1998, interest rates payable were at a
weighted average fixed rate of 6.3% and interest rates receivable averaging
5.2% were based on 30-day commercial paper composite rates. Any interest rate
differential on interest rate swaps and forward agreements is recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the term of each agreement. The
Corporation's risk related to interest rate swap and forward agreements is
limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates.
The potential loss in fair value of interest rate swaps and forward agreements
resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of ten
percent was not material as of December 31, 1999 and 1998.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

  The Corporation enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge
transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase equipment,
certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies,
and to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-domestic
subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate
movements.

  Foreign exchange forward contracts are intended and effective as hedges of
firm, identifiable, foreign currency commitments. In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, these
contracts meet the conditions for hedge accounting treatment and accordingly,
gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying
transactions. Gains and losses on terminated derivatives designated as hedges
are accounted for as part of the originally hedged transaction. Gains and
losses on derivatives designated as hedges of items which mature, are sold or
terminated, are recorded currently in income.

  As of December 31, 1999, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 2000 and 2001 to purchase $18.0 million in foreign
currency, primarily euros and British sterling, and to sell $31.2 million in
foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at contracted
forward rates.

  As of December 31, 1998, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 1999 and 2000 to purchase $10.5 million in foreign
currency, primarily British sterling and Dutch gilders, and to sell $9.6
million in Japanese yen at contracted forward rates.

  The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was estimated by
obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
necessary for maturity differences. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair
value of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated the contract value.
The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts
resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of ten
percent was not material as of December 31, 1999 and 1998.

Commodity Price Risk Management

  The Corporation's most significant raw materials include cocoa, sugar, milk,
peanuts and almonds. The Corporation attempts to minimize the effect of future
price fluctuations related to the purchase of these raw materials primarily
through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements,
generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn
sweeteners, natural gas and certain dairy products, price risks are also
managed by entering into futures contracts. At the present time, active
futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the Corporation's other
major raw materials. Futures contracts are used in combination with forward
purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener, natural gas and certain dairy
product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations
which provide more favorable pricing opportunities and to increase

                                      A-7
<PAGE>

diversity or flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy
requirements. The Corporation's commodity procurement practices are intended
to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially limit
the ability to benefit from possible price decreases.

  The cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity futures
contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to
a variety of factors, including the effect of weather on crop yield, other
imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political
unrest in producing countries and speculative influences. Cocoa prices have
declined recently as additional production, spurred by higher prices of the
mid 1990's, has come on stream and as the economic difficulties in eastern
Europe, particularly Russia, and Southeast Asia, have negatively impacted
demand. During 2000, these negative demand influences could continue to keep
cocoa futures prices contained. The Corporation's costs during 2000 will not
necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward
purchasing practices, premiums and discounts reflective of relative values,
varying delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and
grades of cocoa beans.

Commodities Futures Contracts

  In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural
gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements, the
Corporation enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to
reduce the effect of price fluctuations. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 80, Accounting for Futures Contracts, these
futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as hedges.
Accordingly, gains and losses are deferred and recognized in cost of sales as
part of the product cost. Gains and losses on futures designated as hedges of
anticipated purchases which are no longer likely to occur are recorded
currently in income.

  Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical
forward purchase contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of
futures contracts are made on a daily basis and are included in other current
assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Such cash
transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of
invoice prices of raw materials and energy requirements in the future. Futures
being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced
physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases.

  The following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the
Corporation to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent,
based on the Corporation's net commodity positions at four dates spaced
equally throughout the year. The Corporation's net commodity positions consist
of the excess of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward
contracts for the same commodities, relating to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners
and natural gas. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated
anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the
sensitivity analysis calculations. A loss is defined, for purposes of
determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the
opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The
fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or
estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with
the future delivery period.

  Sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward-looking statements which
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected. The
important factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures
include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting
fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield, other
imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political
unrest in producing countries and speculative influences in addition to
changes in the Corporation's hedging strategies.

1999. Over the most recent five-year period, the return has ranged from 17.8%
in 1996 to 14.8% in 1999. Average invested capital consists of the annual
average of beginning and ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income
taxes and stockholders' equity. For the purpose of calculating operating
return on average invested capital, earnings is defined as net income,
excluding the after-tax restructuring activities in 1995, the after-tax loss
on disposal of businesses in 1996, the after-tax gain on the sale of the pasta
business in 1999, and the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt.

                           HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Significant accounting policies employed by the Corporation are discussed
below and in other notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the 1999
presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts
and transactions.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates,
particularly for accounts receivable and certain current and long-term
liabilities.

Revenue Recognition

  Sales are recorded at the time products are shipped and risk of loss is
transferred.

Cash Equivalents

  All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Commodities Futures Contracts

  In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural
gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements, the
Corporation enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to
reduce the effect of price fluctuations. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 80, Accounting for Futures Contracts, these
futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as hedges.
Accordingly, gains and losses are deferred and recognized in cost of sales as
part of the product cost. Gains and losses on futures designated as hedges of
anticipated purchases which are no longer likely to occur are recorded in
income currently.

Property, Plant and Equipment

  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of buildings,
machinery and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives.


Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions

  Intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions principally consist
of the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets of
businesses acquired (goodwill). Goodwill was $431.7 million and $508.0 million
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The decrease in goodwill
primarily reflected the divestiture of the Corporation's pasta business in
January 1999.

                                     A-15
<PAGE>

Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Other intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
The Corporation periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have
occurred indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be
recoverable. When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Corporation uses an estimate of the acquired
business' undiscounted future cash flows compared to the related carrying
amount of net assets, including goodwill, to determine if an impairment loss
should be recognized.

  Accumulated amortization of intangible assets resulting from business
acquisitions was $121.6 million and $132.3 million as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The decrease in accumulated amortization reflected the
divestiture of the Corporation's pasta business in January 1999.

Comprehensive Income

  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income (SFAS
No. 130). SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components. SFAS No. 130 requires that an
enterprise (a) classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in
a financial statement and (b) display the accumulated balance of other
comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in
capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position.

  Results of operations for foreign entities are translated using the average
exchange rates during the period. For foreign entities, assets and liabilities
are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss), "Foreign Currency Translation
Adjustments."

  A minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the actuarial
present value of accumulated pension plan benefits exceeds plan assets and
accrued pension liabilities, less allowable intangible assets. Minimum pension
liability adjustments, net of income taxes, are recorded as a component of
other comprehensive income (loss), "Minimum Pension Liability Adjustments, net
of tax benefit."

  Comprehensive income (loss) is reported on the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders' Equity and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) is reported on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

  The Corporation enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge
transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase equipment,
certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies,
and to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-domestic
subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate
movements.

  Foreign exchange forward contracts are intended and effective as hedges of
firm, identifiable, foreign currency commitments. Accordingly, gains and
losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying transactions.
Gains and losses on terminated derivatives designated as hedges are accounted
for as part of the originally hedged transaction. Gains and losses on
derivatives designated as hedges of items which mature, are sold or
terminated, are recorded currently in income. In entering into these contracts
the Corporation has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible
inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
Corporation does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

                                     A-16
<PAGE>

License Agreements

  The Corporation has entered into license agreements under which it has
access to certain trademarks and proprietary technology, and manufactures
and/or markets and distributes certain products. The rights under these
agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporation's option
subject to certain conditions, including minimum sales levels, which the
Corporation has met. License fees and royalties, payable under the terms of
the agreements, are expensed as incurred.

Research and Development

  The Corporation expenses research and development costs as incurred.
Research and development expense was $26.7 million, $28.6 million and $27.5
million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Advertising

  The Corporation expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense
was $164.9 million, $187.5 million and $202.4 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Prepaid advertising as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, was $5.8
million and $12.1 million, respectively.

Computer Software

  In 1997, the Corporation began capitalizing certain costs of computer
software developed or obtained for internal use. The amount capitalized as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, was $82.2 million and $69.3 million, respectively.
If such costs were capitalized in prior years, the effect would not have been
material. Software assets are classified as other non-current assets and are
amortized over periods up to five years. Accumulated amortization of
capitalized software was $15.1 million and $2.8 million as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

2.DIVESTITURE

  In January 1999, the Corporation completed the sale of a 94% majority
interest of its U.S. pasta business to New World Pasta, LLC. The transaction
included the AMERICAN BEAUTY, IDEAL BY SAN GIORGIO, LIGHT 'N FLUFFY, MRS.
WEISS, P&R, RONZONI, SAN GIORGIO and SKINNER pasta brands, along with six
manufacturing plants. In the first quarter of 1999, the Corporation received
cash proceeds of $450.0 million, retained a 6% minority interest and recorded
a gain of approximately $243.8 million before tax, $165.0 million or $1.17 per
share--diluted after tax, as a result of the transaction. Net sales for the
pasta business were $29.3 million, $373.1 million, and $386.2 million for
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Net income for the pasta business was $1.5
million, $25.9 million and $25.2 million for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

3.RENTAL AND LEASE COMMITMENTS

  Rent expense was $45.5 million, $39.6 million and $31.8 million for 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively. Rent expense pertains to all operating leases,
which were principally related to certain administrative buildings,
distribution facilities and transportation equipment. In July 1999, the
Corporation entered into an operating lease agreement for an amount not to
exceed $65 million for the purpose of financing construction costs of a
warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the Corporation
near Hershey, Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor pays for the
construction costs and thereafter leases the facility to the Corporation. The
lease term is six years, including the construction period. The lease may be
extended at the Corporation's option for up to four renewal periods of five
years each. The lease provides for a substantial residual guarantee and
includes an option to purchase the facility at original cost. The first phase
of the distribution center is expected to open in the second quarter of 2000.
Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable

                                     A-17
<PAGE>

operating leases with a remaining term in excess of one year as of December
31, 1999, were: 2000, $18.5 million; 2001, $19.7 million; 2002, $18.9 million;
2003, $18.3 million; 2004, $18.1 million; 2005 and beyond, $42.9 million.

4.DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.
SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and
losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement,
and requires that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.

  SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000,
but may be implemented as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after
issuance. Retroactive application is not permitted. SFAS No. 133 must be
applied to (a) derivative instruments and (b) certain derivative instruments
embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued, acquired, or substantively
modified after December 31, 1997. Changes in accounting methods will be
required for derivative instruments utilized by the Corporation to hedge
commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks. Such
derivatives currently include, but are not limited to, commodity futures
contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, and interest rate swaps and
forward agreements.

  The Corporation anticipates the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January 1,
2001. As of December 31, 1999, net deferred losses on derivatives of
approximately $38.2 million after tax would have been reported as a component
of other comprehensive loss and classified as accumulated other comprehensive
loss on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption of SFAS No. 133. The
adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Corporation's results of operations.

5.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

  The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
approximated fair value as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, because of the
relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-
term debt, including the current portion, was $880.7 million as of December
31, 1999, compared to a fair value of $856.9 million based on quoted market
prices for the same or similar debt issues. The carrying value of long-term
debt, including the current portion, was $879.2 million as of December 31,
1998, compared to a fair value of approximately $1.0 billion.

  As of December 31, 1999, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 2000 and 2001 to purchase $18.0 million in foreign
currency, primarily euros and British sterling, and to sell $31.2 million in
foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, at contracted
forward rates.

  As of December 31, 1998, the Corporation had foreign exchange forward
contracts maturing in 1999 and 2000 to purchase $10.5 million in foreign
currency, primarily British sterling and Dutch gilders, and to sell $9.6
million in Japanese yen at contracted forward rates.

  The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by
obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
necessary for maturity differences. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair
value of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated the contract value.
The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
purposes.

                                     A-18
<PAGE>

  In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate
exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap
agreements. In October 1999, the Corporation entered into an interest rate
swap agreement to effectively convert $200 million of 6.7% Notes Due 2005
(Notes) to variable rate debt. The interest rate swap agreement is cancelable
at the sole discretion of the counterparty effective April 2, 2001. At the
same time, the Corporation entered into forward interest rate agreements to
fix the interest rate on the Notes at 5.8% through April 2, 2001.
Subsequently, if the counterparty chooses not to cancel the agreement, the
interest rate on the Notes would be variable based on the London InterBank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) until expiration on October 1, 2005.

  As of December 31, 1998, the Corporation had agreements outstanding with an
aggregate notional amount of $75.0 million maturing in September 1999 to
effectively convert a portion of its floating rate commercial paper borrowings
to fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 1998, interest rates payable were at a
weighted average fixed rate of 6.3% and interest rates receivable averaging
5.2% were based on 30-day commercial paper composite rates. Any interest rate
differential on interest rate swaps and forward agreements is recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the term of each agreement. The
Corporation's risk related to interest rate swap and forward agreements is
limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates.

6.INTEREST EXPENSE

  Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

</TABLE>

7.SHORT-TERM DEBT

  Generally, the Corporation's short-term borrowings are in the form of
commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or
less. As of December 31, 1999, the Corporation maintained a committed credit
facility agreement with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $500.0 million
which could be borrowed directly or used to support the issuance of commercial
paper. The Corporation has the option to increase the credit facility by $1.0
billion with the concurrence of the banks. In December 1999, the short-term
credit facility agreement was renewed for a total of $200 million and the
long-term committed credit facility agreement remained in effect for $300
million, expiring in December 2002. The credit facilities may be used to fund
general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in
certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions.

  The Corporation also maintains lines of credit arrangements with domestic
and international commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various
currencies up to approximately $25.0 million and $23.0 million as of December
31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, at the lending banks' prime commercial
interest rates or lower.

  The Corporation had combined domestic commercial paper borrowings, and
short-term foreign bank loans against its credit facilities and lines of
credit of $209.2 million as of December 31, 1999, and

                                     A-19
<PAGE>

$345.9 million as of December 31, 1998. The weighted average interest rates on
short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, were 5.8%
and 5.2%, respectively.

  The credit facilities and lines of credit were supported by commitment fee
arrangements. The average fee during 1999 was less than .1% per annum of the
commitment. The Corporation's credit facility agreements contain a financial
covenant which requires that a specified interest and fixed charge ratio be
maintained. These agreements are also subject to other representations and
covenants which do not materially restrict the Corporation's activities. The
Corporation is in compliance with all covenants included in the credit
facility agreements. There were no significant compensating balance agreements
which legally restricted these funds.

  As a result of maintaining a consolidated cash management system, the
Corporation maintains overdraft positions at certain banks. Such overdrafts,
which were included in accounts payable, were $28.3 million and $57.0 million
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

8.LONG-TERM DEBT

  Long-term debt consisted of the following:

  In October 1999, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap
agreement to effectively convert $200 million of 6.7% Notes due 2005 to
variable rate debt. The interest rate swap agreement is cancelable at the sole
discretion of the counterparty effective April 2, 2001. At the same time, the
Corporation entered into forward interest rate agreements to fix the interest
rate on the Notes at 5.8% through April 2, 2001. Subsequently, if the
counterparty chooses not to cancel the agreement, the interest rate on the
Notes would be variable based on LIBOR until expiration on October 1, 2005.

  Aggregate annual maturities during the next five years are: 2000, $2.4
million; 2001, $.7 million; 2002, $.8 million; 2003, $17.1 million; and $.1
million in 2004. The Corporation's debt is principally unsecured and of equal
priority. None of the debt is convertible into stock of the Corporation. The
Corporation is in compliance with all covenants included in the related debt
agreements.

  In January 1999, the Corporation received a Notice of Proposed Deficiency
from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to the years 1989 through
1996. The most significant issue pertains to the Corporate Owned Life
Insurance (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The
IRS proposed an assessment for the disallowance of interest expense deductions
associated with the underlying life insurance policies. The total impact of
the disallowance was approximately $60.4 million, including interest as of
December 31, 1999. The Corporation may be subject to additional assessments
for federal and state tax and interest payments for years subsequent to 1996.
The Corporation believes that it has fully complied with the tax law as it
relates to its COLI program. The Corporation filed a protest of the proposed
deficiency with the Appeals section of the IRS in April 1999 and continues to
vigorously defend its position on this matter.

10.PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

  The Corporation's policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in
accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Federal income tax laws,
respectively. Non-domestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with
applicable local laws and regulations. Plan assets are invested in a broadly
diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international
common stocks and fixed income securities. Other benefits include health care
and life insurance provided by the Corporation under two post-retirement
benefit plans.

  Effective December 31, 1998, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pension and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits (SFAS No. 132). The provisions of SFAS No. 132 revise
employers' disclosures about pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
It does not change the measurement or recognition of these plans.

  For measurement purposes, a 6% annual rate of increase in the per capita
cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2000 and future years.

  As of December 31, 1999, for pension plans with accumulated benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets, the related projected benefit obligation
and accumulated benefit obligation were $36.4 million and $35.0 million,
respectively, with no plan assets.

  As of December 31, 1998, for pension plans with accumulated benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets, the related projected benefit
obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets
were $81.1 million, $66.9 million and $22.7 million, respectively.

  A minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the actuarial
present value of accumulated plan benefits exceeds plan assets and accrued
pension liabilities. In 1999, accrued pension

                                     A-23
<PAGE>

liabilities exceeded the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits
because the discount rate used to determine the present value of accumulated
benefits increased from 6.4% to 7.5% and a plan amendment shifted benefits
from an unfunded pension plan to a funded plan. Accordingly, a minimum pension
liability adjustment of $4.1 million, initially recorded in other
comprehensive income in 1998, was reversed in 1999, net of deferred income
taxes of $2.7 million.

  The Corporation has two post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan
is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually, and the
life insurance plan is non-contributory. During the first quarter of 1999, for
all eligible employees under age 45, the Corporation provided annual
contributions into the Employee Savings Stock Investment and Ownership Plan
(ESSIOP) instead of providing coverage under the current retiree medical plan.
This change resulted in the immediate recognition of a $15.4 million pre-tax
gain which is not included above as a component of net periodic benefits
costs. The changes applied primarily to U.S. hourly employees working in
Pennsylvania.

  Effective December 1998, all U.S. full-time salaried employees, and all non-
union hourly plant employees working outside Hershey, PA under age 45 were
eligible for the ESSIOP contributions. This change resulted in the immediate
recognition of a $13.0 million pre-tax gain which is not included above as a
component of net periodic benefits cost in 1998.

  Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point change in
assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

11.EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP TRUST

  The Corporation's employee stock ownership trust (ESOP) serves as the
primary vehicle for contributions to its existing ESSIOP for participating
domestic salaried and hourly employees. The ESOP was funded by a 15-year 7.75%
loan of $47.9 million from the Corporation. During 1999 and 1998, the ESOP
received a combination of dividends on unallocated shares and contributions
from the

                                     A-24
<PAGE>

Corporation equal to the amount required to meet its principal and interest
payments under the loan. Simultaneously, the ESOP allocated to participants
159,176 shares of Common Stock each year. As of December 31, 1999, the ESOP
held 980,992 allocated shares and 1,114,224 unallocated shares. All ESOP
shares are considered outstanding for income per share computations.

  The Corporation recognized net compensation expense equal to the shares
allocated multiplied by the original cost of $20 1/16 per share less dividends
received by the ESOP on unallocated shares. Compensation expense related to
the ESOP for 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $1.6 million, $1.0 million, and $1.4
million, respectively. Dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares were $1.2
million in both 1999 and 1998 and $1.3 million in 1997. The unearned ESOP
compensation balance in stockholders' equity represented deferred compensation
expense to be recognized by the Corporation in future years as additional
shares are allocated to participants.

12.CAPITAL STOCK AND NET INCOME PER SHARE

  As of December 31, 1999, the Corporation had 530,000,000 authorized shares
of capital stock. Of this total, 450,000,000 shares were designated as Common
Stock, 75,000,000 shares as Class B Common Stock (Class B Stock), and
5,000,000 shares as Preferred Stock, each class having a par value of one
dollar per share. As of December 31, 1999 a combined total of 179,950,872
shares of both classes of common stock had been issued of which 138,459,619
shares were outstanding. No shares of the Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding during the three-year period ended December 31, 1999.

  Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together
without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the
election of directors, with the Common Stock having one vote per share and the
Class B Stock having ten votes per share. However, the Common Stock, voting
separately as a class, is entitled to elect one-sixth of the Board of
Directors. With respect to dividend rights, the Common Stock is entitled to
cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock.

  Class B Stock can be converted into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis
at any time. During 1999, 1998 and 1997, a total of 4,000 shares, 18,000
shares, and 13,000 shares, respectively, of Class B Stock were converted into
Common Stock.

  Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School
(Milton Hershey School Trust), as institutional fiduciary for estates and
trusts unrelated to Milton Hershey School, and as direct owner of investment
shares, held a total of 12,929,073 shares of the Common Stock, and as Trustee
for the benefit of Milton Hershey School, held 30,306,006 shares of the Class
B Stock as of December 31, 1999, and was entitled to cast approximately 77% of
the total votes of both classes of the Corporation's common stock. The Milton
Hershey School Trust must approve the issuance of shares of Common Stock or
any other action which would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust not
continuing to have voting control of the Corporation.

  During 1999, 5,478,379 shares of Common Stock were repurchased for $318.0
million, including 1,579,779 shares of the Corporation's Common Stock
purchased from the Milton Hershey School Trust for $100.0 million. A total of
15,339,498 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased for approximately
$605.6 million under share repurchase programs which were approved by the
Corporation's Board of Director's in 1993, 1996 and 1999. Of the shares
repurchased, 528,000 shares were retired, 1,320,781 shares were reissued to
satisfy stock options obligations, Supplemental Retirement Contributions and
ESOP obligations and the remaining 13,490,717 shares were held as Treasury
Stock as of December 31, 1999. In August 1997, the Corporation purchased
9,900,990 shares of its Common Stock to be held as Treasury Stock from the
Milton Hershey School Trust for $500.0 million and in August 1995, 18,099,546
shares were purchased from the Milton Hershey School Trust for $500.0 million.
A total of 41,491,253 shares were held as Treasury Stock as of December 31,
1999.

as follows:

</TABLE>

  For the year ended December 31, 1999, 1.8 million stock options were not
included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the exercise
price was higher than the average market price of the Common Stock for the
year and therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive.

13.STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN

  The long-term portion of the Key Employee Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan),
provides for grants of stock-based compensation awards to senior executives
and key employees of one or more of the following: non-qualified stock options
(fixed stock options), performance stock units, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock units. The Incentive Plan also provides for the deferral of
performance stock unit awards by participants. As of December 31, 1999, 15.3
million shares were authorized for grants under the long-term portion of the
Incentive Plan.

  In 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a world-wide, broad-
based employee stock option program, called HSY Growth. HSY Growth provides
all eligible employees with a one-time grant of 100 non-qualified stock
options. Under HSY Growth, over 1.2 million options were granted on January 7,
1997.

  The Corporation applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations, in
accounting for the Incentive Plan and HSY Growth. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option grants. Had compensation
cost for the Corporation's stock-based compensation plans been determined
based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under the Incentive Plan
and HSY Growth consistent with the method of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Corporation's
net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

  The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1999, 1998 and 1997,

                                     A-26

respectively: dividend yields of 1.4%, 1.6% and 1.9%, expected volatility of
23%, 21% and 20%, risk-free interest rates of 4.9%, 5.9% and 6.2%, and
expected lives of 6.5 years, 6.5 years and 5.7 years.

Fixed Stock Options

  The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the
Corporation's Common Stock on the date of grant. Under the Incentive Plan,
options are granted in January and generally vest at the end of the second
year and have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted under the HSY
Growth program vest at the end of the fifth year and have a term of ten years.

Performance Stock Units

  Under the long-term portion of the Incentive Plan, each January the
Corporation grants selected executives and other key employees performance
stock units whose vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain
performance objectives. If at the end of three-year performance cycles,
targets for financial measures of earnings per share, economic value added and
free cash flow are met, the full number of shares are awarded to the
participants. The performance scores can range from 0% to 150% of the targeted
amounts. The compensation amount (credited to) charged against income for the
performance-based plan was $(1.9) million, $6.6 million and $9.1 million for
1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. The compensation credit in 1999 resulted
from a partial achievement of the current year

                                     A-27
<PAGE>

cycle objectives, expectation of partially achieving the target objectives for
the 2000 cycle and the lower stock price. The compensation cost associated
with the long-term portion of the Incentive Plan is recognized ratably over
the three-year term based on the year-end market value of the stock.
Performance stock units and restricted stock units granted for potential
future distribution were as follows:

14.SUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION

Accounts Receivable--Trade

  In the normal course of business, the Corporation extends credit to
customers which satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. The Corporation believes
that it has little concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of its
customer base. Receivables, as shown on the consolidated balance sheets, were
net of allowances and anticipated discounts of $16.9 million and $19.9 million
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.


Inventories

  The Corporation values the majority of its inventories under the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method and the remaining inventories at the lower of first-
in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. LIFO cost of inventories valued using the
LIFO method was $469.2 million and $342.9 million as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively, and all inventories were stated at amounts that did not
exceed realizable values. Total inventories were as follows:

                    RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  Hershey Foods Corporation is responsible for the financial statements and
other financial information contained in this report. The Corporation believes
that the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles appropriate under the circumstances to reflect
in all material respects the substance of applicable events and transactions.
In preparing the financial statements, it is necessary that management make
informed estimates and judgments. The other financial information in this
annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

  The Corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed
to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable for
purposes of preparing financial statements and that assets are properly
accounted for and safeguarded. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on
the recognition that the cost of the system must be related to the benefits to
be derived. The Corporation believes its system provides an appropriate
balance in this regard. The Corporation maintains an Internal Audit Department
which reviews the adequacy and tests the application of internal accounting
controls.

  The financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP,
independent public accountants, whose appointment was ratified by stockholder
vote at the stockholders' meeting held on April 27, 1999. Their report
expresses an opinion that the Corporation's financial statements are fairly
stated in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, and they
have indicated to us that their audit was performed in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which are designed to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.

  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, consisting
solely of non-management directors, meets regularly with the independent
public accountants, internal auditors and management to discuss, among other
things, the audit scopes and results. Arthur Andersen LLP and the internal
auditors both have full and free access to the Audit Committee, with and
without the presence of management.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of Hershey Foods Corporation:

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hershey
Foods Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows
and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, appearing on pages A-11 through A-30. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Hershey Foods Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
