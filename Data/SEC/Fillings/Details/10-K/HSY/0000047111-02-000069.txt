<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2>Item 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  BUSINESS</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Hershey     Foods     Corporation     and     its     subsidiaries     (the
&#147;Corporation&#148;)  are engaged in the manufacture,  distribution and sale
of consumer food products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line
of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  was organized  under the laws of the State of Delaware on
October  24,  1927,  as a successor  to a business  founded in 1894 by Milton S.
Hershey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In July  2001,  the  Corporation&#146;s  Brazilian  subsidiary,  Hershey do
Brasil,  acquired the chocolate and confectionery  business of Visagis for $17.1
million.  Included in the acquisition  were the  <I>IO-IO</I>  brand of hazelnut
cr&#232;me  items and the  chocolate and  confectionery  products sold under the
<I>VISCONTI</I>  brand. Also included in the purchase were a manufacturing plant
and  confectionery  equipment in Sao Roque,  Brazil.  This business had sales of
approximately $20 million in 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In   September   2001,   the   Corporation   completed   the  sale  of  its
<I>LUDEN&#146;S</I>  throat drops business to Pharmacia Consumer  Healthcare,  a
unit of  Pharmacia  Corporation.  Included in the sale were the  trademarks  and
manufacturing equipment for the throat drops business.  Under a supply agreement
with Pharmacia, the Corporation agreed to manufacture <I>LUDEN&#146;S</I> throat
drops for up to 19  months  after the date of sale.  Under a  separate  services
agreement,  the Corporation agreed to continue to sell, warehouse and distribute
<I>LUDEN&#146;S</I> throat drops through March 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In October  2001,  the  Corporation  announced  initiatives  to enhance its
future  operating  performance  by focusing on profitable  sales  growth,
ongoing   improvement  of  margins  and  asset   management  and  a  more
streamlined,  results-driven organization. A charge to cost of sales, along with
a business   realignment  and  asset  impairment   charge,   totaling   $278.4
million  before  tax, or $1.25 per share - diluted,  were recorded in
the fourth  quarter of 2001 to support the  initiatives.  Additional  charges of
approximately  $31.6  million before tax, or $.14 per share &#150;
diluted,  are expected to be recorded in 2002.  These  initiatives will generate
ongoing  annual  savings of $75 million to $80 million  when fully  implemented,
which will be reinvested to enhance  marketing  and selling  capabilities.  Cash
flows  for the  business  have  increased  as a  result  of  these  initiatives.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The charge to cost of sales primarily included costs related to selling
and  reducing  raw material  inventories,  principally  cocoa beans and cocoa
butter,  no longer required to support operations.  The business realignment
and  asset  impairments   charge  included  costs  related  to  outsourcing  the
production of cocoa powder, the elimination of certain non-strategic brands, the
elimination of underutilized capacity through the closure of three manufacturing
facilities and one distribution  center,  realignment of the sales organization,
and a voluntary work force reduction program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation&#146;s  principal  product groups  include:  chocolate and
non-chocolate confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items
and  boxed  items;  and  grocery  products  in the form of  baking  ingredients,
chocolate  drink mixes,  peanut  butter,  dessert  toppings and  beverages.  The
Corporation  believes it is a leader in these product  groups in North  America.
Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands.
Generally,  such margins on chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery  products
are greater than those on grocery products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In North America, the Corporation  manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate
confectionery  products  in a variety of packaged  forms and markets  them under
more than 50 brands. The different  packaged forms include various  arrangements
of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as a variety of
different  sizes  and  weights  of the same bar  products,  such as snack  size,
standard,  king size,  large and giant bars.  Among the principal  chocolate and
non-chocolate confectionery products in the United States are: <I>HERSHEY&#146;S

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation manufactures and/or markets a line of grocery products in the
baking, beverage, peanut butter and toppings categories. Principal products in
the United States include <I>HERSHEY&#146;S, REESE&#146;S</I> and<I> HEATH</I>

produced and sold under license by various dairies throughout the United States,
using milk mixes manufactured by the Corporation. Baking and various other
products are produced and sold under the <I>HERSHEY&#146;S</I> and
<I>REESE&#146;S</I> brand names by third parties who have been granted licenses
by the Corporation to use these trademarks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation has license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or
sell products worldwide. Among the more significant are agreements with
affiliated companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or market
and distribute <I>YORK,</I> <I>PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY </I>and <I>PETER PAUL
MOUNDS </I>confectionery products worldwide as well as <I>CADBURY </I>and
<I>CARAMELLO </I>confectionery products in the United States. The
Corporation&#146;s rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term
basis at the Corporation&#146;s option. The license for <I>CADBURY </I>and
<I>CARAMELLO </I>products is subject to a minimum sales requirement which the
Corporation exceeded in 2001. The Corporation also has an agreement with Societe
des Produits Nestle SA, which licenses the Corporation to manufacture and
distribute <I>KIT KAT </I>and <I>ROLO </I>confectionery products in the United
States. The Corporation&#146;s rights under this agreement are extendible on a
long-term basis at the Corporation&#146;s option, subject to certain conditions,
including minimum unit volume sales. In 2001, the minimum volume requirements
were exceeded. The Corporation has an agreement with an affiliate of
Huhtam&#228;ki Oy (&#147;Huhtamaki&#148;) pursuant to which it licenses the use
of certain trademarks, including <I>GOOD &amp; PLENTY, HEATH, JOLLY RANCHER,
MILK DUDS, PAYDAY </I>and <I>WHOPPERS</I> confectionery products worldwide. The
Corporation&#146;s rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term
basis at the Corporation&#146;s option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation&#146;s products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain
grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores,
vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food
distributors by full-time sales representatives, food brokers and part-time
retail sales merchandisers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The
Corporation believes its products are sold in over 2 million retail outlets in
North America. In 2001, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted
to approximately 18% of the Corporation&#146;s total net sales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
Argentina, Brazil, China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines, the Corporation
imports and/or markets selected confectionery and grocery products. The
Corporation also markets confectionery and grocery products in over 90 countries
worldwide. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation&#146;s marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior
quality of its products, mass distribution and the best possible consumer value
in terms of price and weight. In addition, the Corporation devotes considerable
resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and
marketing of new products. The Corporation utilizes a variety of promotional
programs for customers and advertising and promotional programs for consumers.
The Corporation employs promotional programs at various times during the year to
stimulate sales of certain products. Chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery
and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest
during the third and fourth quarters of the year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation recognizes that the mass distribution of its consumer food products
is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its
customers. The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its
customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times
consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution. To achieve these
objectives, the Corporation has developed a distribution network from its
manufacturing plants, distribution centers and field warehouses strategically
located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a
combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the
distribution points to its customers. In conjunction with sales and marketing
efforts, the distribution system has been instrumental in the effective
promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional
scales. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
time to time, the Corporation has changed the prices and weights of its products
to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs, the competitive environment and
profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. The last
standard candy bar price increase was implemented by the Corporation in December
1995, resulting in a wholesale price increase of approximately 11% on its
standard and king-size candy bars sold in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
most significant raw material used in the production of the Corporation&#146;s
chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally from
West African, South American and Far Eastern equatorial regions. West Africa
accounts for approximately 70% of the world&#146;s crop. Cocoa beans are not
uniform, and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural
practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas. The
Corporation buys a mix of cocoa beans to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and
lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices are
the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures
trading contracts closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of
the Corporation&#146;s forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium
prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans, these average futures contract
prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporation&#146;s average cost of
cocoa beans or cocoa products. </FONT></P>

The  Federal  Agricultural  and  Improvement  Reform  Act of  1996,  which  is a
seven-year farm bill,  impacts the prices of sugar,  peanuts and milk because it
sets price support levels for these commodities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The price of sugar, the  Corporation&#146;s  second most important commodity for
its domestic chocolate and confectionery  products, is subject to price supports
under the above  referenced  farm  legislation.  Due to import quotas and duties
imposed to support the price of sugar  established  by that  legislation,  sugar
prices  paid by United  States  users are  currently  substantially  higher than
prices on the world sugar market.  The average  wholesale  list price of refined
sugar, F.O.B.  Northeast,  has remained in a range of 25&#162;  to 32&#162;  per
pound for the past ten years.  Peanut and almond  prices  remained  near  normal
levels  throughout  2001. Milk prices increased in 2001 as a result of declining
milk  production.  The Corporation  believes that the supply of raw materials is
adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The  Corporation  attempts to minimize the effect of future  price  fluctuations
related to the purchase of its major raw  materials  primarily  through  forward
purchasing  to cover future  manufacturing  requirements,  generally for periods
from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners,  natural gas,
fuel oil and certain  dairy  products,  price risks are also managed by entering
into futures  contracts.  At the present time,  active futures contracts are not
available  for use in pricing the  Corporation&#146;s  other major raw  material
requirements.  Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing
of  cocoa,  sugar,  corn  sweetener,  natural  gas  and  certain  dairy  product
requirements  principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide
more  favorable  pricing  opportunities  and  flexibility  in sourcing these raw
materials  and  energy  requirements.  Fuel oil  futures  contracts  are used to
minimize   price   fluctuations    associated   with   the    Corporation&#146;s
transportation costs. The Corporation&#146;s commodity procurement practices are
intended to reduce the risk of future price increases,  but also may potentially
limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with
margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa, sugar, corn
sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products. Cash outflows and
inflows result from original margins which are &#147;good faith deposits&nbsp;&#148;
established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet
their contractual financial obligations. Additionally, variation margin payments
and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to
reflect daily price movements. The magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows
is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets.
Historically, cash flows related to margin requirements have not been material
to the Corporation&#146;s total working capital requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing
and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities. These
procurement strategies, including the use of futures contracts to hedge the
pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, transportation costs and
certain dairy products, are directly linked to the overall planning and
management of the Corporation&#146;s business, since the cost of raw materials,
energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales.
Procurement strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material
requirements, energy requirements, and transportation costs are developed by the
analysis of fundamentals, including weather and crop analysis, and by
discussions with market analysts, brokers and dealers. Procurement strategies
are determined, implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior
management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported
to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the Corporation&#146;s brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among
the leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in
highly competitive markets and compete with many other multinational, national,
regional and local firms, some of which have resources in excess of those
available to the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Orders</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from
finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of
orders, such backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales, nor are
the changes from time to time significant, aside from the third quarter of 1999
when a significant backlog of orders resulted from customer service and order
fulfillment problems encountered during the start-up of new business systems and
processes. </FONT></P>

Development</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation engages in a variety of research activities. These principally
involve development of new products, improvement in the quality of existing
products, improvement and modernization of production processes, and the
development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and
value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning the
Corporation&#146;s research and development expense is contained in Note 1 of
the Corporation&#146;s Annual Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to
the Proxy Statement, which information is incorporated herein by reference and

Corporation&#146;s domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and
Drug Administration and various other governmental agencies, and its products
must comply with regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
with various comparable state statutes regulating the manufacturing and
marketing of food products. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Environmental
Considerations</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the past the Corporation has made investments based on compliance with
environmental laws and regulations. Such expenditures have not been material
with respect to the Corporation&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Employees</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation had approximately  14,400 full-time and
1,600  part-time  employees,   of  whom  approximately  6,000  were  covered  by
collective bargaining  agreements.  In 2002, the Corporation expects a reduction
of approximately  600 full-time  employees as a result of a voluntary work force
reduction program. The Corporation  considers its employee relations to be good.
It should be noted that a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately
3,000  employees  at two of  the  Corporation's  principal  plants  in  Hershey,
Pennsylvania expired in November 2001. On February 27, 2002, the employees voted
not to ratify a new  contract  offer,  despite  recommendations  by their  union
negotiating committee and executive board to approve the new five-year contract.
The  Corporation  and the union  negotiating  committee  have agreed to seek the
assistance of a federal mediator. </FONT></P>

nature of the Corporation&#146;s operations and the environment in which it
operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In connection with the
&#147;safe harbor&#148; provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, the Corporation notes the following factors which, among others,
could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Many of
the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by
the use of forward-looking words such as &#147;believe,&#148;

&#147;planned,&#148; &#147;estimated,&#148; and &#147;potential,&#148; among
others. Factors which could cause results to differ include, but are not limited
to: changes in the confectionery and grocery business environment, including
actions of competitors and changes in consumer preferences; changes in
governmental laws and regulations, including taxes; market demand for new and
existing products; changes in raw material and other costs; the
Corporation&#146;s ability to implement improvements to and reduce costs

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2>Item 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</FONT></H2>

     <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 1999, the Corporation received
a Notice of Proposed Deficiency (Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
related to the years 1989 through  1996.  The Notice  pertained to the Corporate
Owned Life Insurance  (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in
1989. The IRS disallowed the interest  expense  deductions  associated  with the
underlying  life  insurance  policies.  The total  deficiency of $61.2  million,
including  interest,  was paid to the IRS in September 2000 to eliminate further
accruing of interest.  Effective  October 1, 2001, the Corporation  negotiated a
settlement with the IRS regarding the Notice.  The resulting  Closing  Agreement
with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense deductions for all applicable tax
years and resulted in the surrender of all insurance  policies,  thereby  ending
the COLI program.  The  settlement  is a complete  resolution of all federal and
state tax aspects of this program. The Corporation has no other material pending
legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine  litigation  incidental to its
business.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We have audited, in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
consolidated financial statements included in Hershey Foods Corporation&#146;s
Proxy Statement for its 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders incorporated by
reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January
22, 2002. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed on page 15 in Item
14(a)(2) is the responsibility of the Corporation&#146;s management and is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole. </FONT></P>

<PAGE>
Revolving  Credit  Advance.  Each  Lender  shall,  before  (i) in the  case of a
Eurodollar Rate Advance,  11:00 A.M. (New York City time) or (ii) in the case of
a Base  Rate  Advance,  1:00  P.M.  (New  York  City  time)  on the date of such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,  make  available for the account of its Applicable
Lending  Office to the Agent at the  Agent's  Account,  in same day funds,  such
Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit  Borrowing.  After the Agent's
receipt of such funds and upon  fulfillment  of the  applicable  conditions  set
forth in Article III,  the Agent will make such funds  available to the Borrower
requesting the Revolving  Credit Borrowing at the Agent's address referred to in
Section 9.02.

                  (b)  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, a
Borrower  may not select  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  for any  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing if the  obligation  of the Lenders to make  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances
shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12.

                  (c) Each Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing of any Borrower
shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower.  In the case of any Revolving
Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies
is to be comprised of Eurodollar  Rate Advances,  the Borrower  requesting  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall  indemnify  each Lender,  after receipt of a
written request by such Lender setting forth in reasonable  detail the basis for
such request, against any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by such Lender
as a result of any  failure  by such  Borrower  to fulfill on or before the date
specified in such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing for such Revolving Credit
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without
limitation,  any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits),  cost or expense
actually  incurred by reason of the  liquidation or  reemployment of deposits or
other funds  acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving  Credit Advance to be
made  by such  Lender  as part of such  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  when  such
Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

                  (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate
Advances  or prior to the time of the  proposed  disbursement  of any  Revolving
Credit Borrowing  comprised of Base Rate Advances that such Lender will not make
available to the Agent such Lender's  ratable  portion of such Revolving  Credit
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Agent on the date of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in accordance with
subsection  (a) of this  Section  2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance  upon such
assumption,  make available to the Borrower  requesting  such  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing on such date a  corresponding  amount.  If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion  available to the Agent, such
Lender and such  Borrower  severally  agree to repay to the Agent  forthwith  on
demand such  corresponding  amount together with interest thereon,  for each day
from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest
rate  applicable  at the  time to  Revolving  Credit  Advances  comprising  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of such  Lender,  the Federal
Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such  corresponding  amount,
such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as
part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit
Advance to be made by it as part of any  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall not
relieve  any  other  Lender of its  obligation,  if any,  hereunder  to make its
Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing,  but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Revolving  Credit  Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of
any Revolving Credit Borrowing.

in the manner  set forth  below;  provided  that,  following  the making of each
Competitive Bid Borrowing, the aggregate amount of the Advances then outstanding

          comprising any such Competitive Bid Borrowing being referred to herein
          as "Fixed Rate Advances") and (B) at least four Business Days prior to
          the date of the proposed  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  if such Borrower
          shall instead  specify in the Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing that
          the rates of  interest to be offered by the Lenders are to be based on
          the LIBO Rate (the Advances  comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing
          being  referred  to herein as "LIBO Rate  Advances").  Each  Notice of
          Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  of a Borrower  shall be  irrevocable  and
          binding on such Borrower. Any Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing by a
          Designated  Subsidiary  shall be given to the Agent in accordance with
          the  preceding   sentence  through  the  Company  on  behalf  of  such
          Designated  Subsidiary.  The Agent shall in turn promptly  notify each

          from a Borrower by sending such Lender a copy of the related Notice of
          Competitive Bid Borrowing.

          in its sole discretion,  elect to make any such offer, it shall notify
          such Borrower of such offer at least 30 minutes before the time and on
          the date on which notice of such  election is to be given to the Agent
          by the other  Lenders.  If any Lender  shall elect not to make such an
          offer,  such Lender shall so notify the Agent,  before 10:00 A.M. (New
          York City time) on the date on which notice of such  election is to be
          given to the Agent by the other Lenders,  and such Lender shall not be
          obligated to, and shall not, make any  Competitive Bid Advance as part
          of such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing;  provided that the failure by any
          Lender to give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be obligated
          to  make  any  Competitive  Bid  Advance  as  part  of  such  proposed
          Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                  (iii)    The Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing
          shall, in turn,  before 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of
          such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive
          Bid Borrowing  consisting of Fixed Rate Advances and before 11:00 A.M.
          (New York City  time)  three  Business  Days  before  the date of such
          proposed  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive Bid
          Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances, either:

                           (x)      cancel such Competitive Bid Borrowing by
                  giving the Agent notice to that effect, or

                           (y) accept one or more of the offers made by any
                  Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its
                  sole discretion, by giving notice to the Agent of the amount
                  of each Competitive Bid Advance (which amount shall be equal
                  to or greater than the minimum amount, and equal to or less
                  than the maximum amount, notified to such Borrower by the
                  Agent on behalf of such Lender for such Competitive Bid
                  Advance pursuant to paragraph (ii) above) to be made by each
                  Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, and reject
                  any remaining offers made by Lenders pursuant to paragraph
                  (ii) above by giving the Agent notice to that effect;
                  provided, however, that such Borrower shall not accept any
                  offer in excess of the requested bid amount for any maturity.
                  Such

                                       17
<PAGE>

                  Borrower shall accept the offers made by any Lender or
                  Lenders to make Competitive Bid Advances in order of the
                  lowest to the highest rates of interest offered by such
                  Lenders. If two or more Lenders have offered the same interest
                  rate, the amount to be borrowed at such interest rate will be
                  allocated among such Lenders in proportion to the amount that
                  each such Lender offered at such interest rate.

                  (iv)     If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
          notifies the Agent that such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing is cancelled
          pursuant  to  paragraph  (iii)(x)  above,  the Agent shall give prompt
          notice thereof to the Lenders and such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall
          not be made.

                  (v)      If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
          accepts  one or  more of the  offers  made by any  Lender  or  Lenders
          pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above, the Agent shall in turn promptly
          notify  (A)  each  Lender  that has  made an  offer  as  described  in
          paragraph  (ii)  above,  of the  date  and  aggregate  amount  of such
          Competitive  Bid Borrowing and whether or not any offer or offers made
          by such Lender  pursuant to paragraph (ii) above have been accepted by
          such  Borrower,  (B) each  Lender  that is to make a  Competitive  Bid
          Advance as part of such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing,  of the amount of
          each Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such
          Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,  and (C)  each  Lender  that is to make a
          Competitive  Bid Advance as part of such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,
          upon receipt, that the Agent has received forms of documents appearing
          to fulfill the  applicable  conditions  set forth in Article III. Each
          Lender  that  is to make a  Competitive  Bid  Advance  as part of such
          Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  shall,  before  12:00 Noon (New York City
          time) on the date of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing  specified in the
          notice received from the Agent pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding
          sentence or any later time when such Lender shall have received notice
          from the Agent pursuant to clause (C) of the preceding sentence,  make
          available  for the  account of its  Applicable  Lending  Office to the
          Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's portion
          of such Competitive Bid Borrowing.  Upon fulfillment of the applicable
          conditions  set forth in Article III and after receipt by the Agent of
          such funds,  the Agent will make such funds available to such Borrower
          at the Agent's  address  referred to in Section 9.02.  Promptly  after
          each  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing the Agent will notify each Lender of
          the  amount  of  the   Competitive   Bid  Borrowing,   the  consequent
          Competitive  Bid Reduction  and the dates upon which such  Competitive
          Bid Reduction commenced and will terminate.

                  (vi)     If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
          notifies  the Agent that it accepts  one or more of the offers made by
          any Lender or Lenders  pursuant  to  paragraph  (iii)(y)  above,  such
          notice  of  acceptance  shall  be  irrevocable  and  binding  on  such
          Borrower.  Such Borrower shall indemnify each Lender, after receipt of
          a written  request by such Lender  setting forth in reasonable  detail
          the basis for such request, against any loss, cost or expense actually
          incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by such Borrower to
          fulfill  on or before  the date  specified  in the  related  Notice of
          Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  for such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing the
          applicable  conditions  set forth in Article III,  including,  without
          limitation, any loss (other than loss

                                       18
<PAGE>

          of anticipated  profits),  cost or expense actually incurred by reason
          of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired
          by such Lender to fund the  Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such
          Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing when such Competitive
          Bid Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

                  (b) Each Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
amount of  $10,000,000  or an integral  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof
and,  following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing,  the Borrower that
has borrowed  through such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in compliance with
the  limitation set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of subsection (a)
above.

                  (c) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this
Section  2.03,  each  Borrower  may from time to time borrow  under this Section
2.03,  repay or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this
Section 2.03.

                  (d) Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid
Borrowing  shall repay to the Agent for the account of each Lender that has made
a Competitive Bid Advance,  on the maturity date of such Competitive Bid Advance
(such  maturity date being that specified by such Borrower for repayment of such
Competitive  Bid  Advance in the related  Notice of  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing
delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(i) above and provided in the  Competitive
Bid Note evidencing such  Competitive  Bid Advance),  the then unpaid  principal
amount of such Competitive Bid Advance. A Borrower shall have no right to prepay
any principal  amount of any  Competitive Bid Advance without the consent of the
Lender  that has made such  Competitive  Bid Advance or as is  specified  in the
Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                  (e) Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid
Borrowing shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal amount of each Competitive
Bid  Advance  from the date of such  Competitive  Bid  Advance  comprising  such
Competitive Bid Borrowing to the date the principal  amount of such  Competitive
Bid Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such  Competitive Bid
Advance  specified  by the Lender  making  such  Competitive  Bid Advance in its
notice with respect  thereto  delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(ii)  above,
payable on the  interest  payment date or dates  specified by such  Borrower for
such  Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing
delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(i) above,  as provided in the Competitive
Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), each Borrower that
has borrowed though a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall pay interest on the amount
of unpaid principal of and interest on each  Competitive Bid Advance  comprising
such Competitive Bid Borrowing that is owing to a Lender,  payable in arrears on
the date or dates interest is payable thereon,  at a rate per annum equal at all
times to 2% per  annum  above  the rate per  annum  required  to be paid on such
Competitive  Bid Advance under the terms of the  Competitive Bid Note evidencing
such  Competitive Bid Advance unless  otherwise  agreed in such  Competitive Bid
Note.

                  (f) The indebtedness of any Borrower resulting from each
Competitive  Bid  Advance  made to such  Borrower as part of a  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing shall be evidenced by a

                                       19
<PAGE>

separate  Competitive  Bid Note of such  Borrower  payable  to the  order of the
Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.





                  SECTION 2.04. Fees. (a) Facility Fee.  The Company agrees to
pay to the  Agent  for the  account  of each  Lender a  facility  fee (i) on the
aggregate amount of such Lender's Commitment from the date hereof in the case of
each Initial  Lender and from the  effective  date  specified in the  Assumption
Agreement or the  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  as the case may be,  pursuant to
which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the  Termination
Date and (ii) if the Company has extended the Final  Maturity  Date  pursuant to
Section  2.18(b),  on the aggregate  principal  amount of the  Revolving  Credit
Advances  payable  to such  Lender  from the  Termination  Date until such Final
Maturity Date, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to
the  Applicable  Percentage  in effect  from time to time,  payable  in  arrears
quarterly  on  the  last  day of  each  March,  June,  September  and  December,
commencing March 31, 2002, and on the Termination Date and on any extended Final
Maturity Date.

                  (b)  Agent's Fees.  The Company shall pay to the Agent for its
own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed in writing  between the
Company and the Agent.

                  SECTION 2.05. Termination, Reduction or Increase of the
Commitments. (a) Termination or Ratable Reduction by the Company. The Company
shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to
terminate  in  whole  or  reduce  ratably  in part the  unused  portions  of the
respective  Commitments  of the Lenders,  provided  that each partial  reduction
shall be in the  aggregate  amount of  $10,000,000  or an  integral  multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and provided, further, that the aggregate amount of
the  Commitments  of the Lenders  shall not be reduced to an amount that is less
than the  aggregate  principal  amount  of the  Competitive  Bid  Advances  then
outstanding. The aggregate amount of the Commitments, once reduced or terminated
as provided in this Section 2.05(a),  may not be reinstated,  except as provided
in Section 2.05(c) below.

                 (b) Termination by the Majority Lenders upon Change of Control.
In the  event  that a Change  of  Control  occurs,  (i) the  Agent  shall at the
request,  or may with the  consent,  of the Majority  Lenders,  by notice to the
Company  given not later than 10 Business  Days after receipt by the Lenders and
the Agent of notice  from the  Company  of such  Change of Control  pursuant  to
Section 5.01(h)(iv),  declare the Commitments  (determined without giving effect
to any Competitive Bid Reduction) to be terminated in whole, effective as of the
date set forth in such  notice,  provided,  however,  that such date shall be no
earlier  than 10  Business  Days after the  Company's  receipt of such notice of
termination  and (ii)  each  Borrower's  right to make a  Borrowing  under  this
Agreement  shall  thereupon be suspended  and shall  remain  suspended  until 10
Business  Days after  receipt by the  Lenders  and the Agent of notice  from the
Company of such  Change of Control  pursuant to Section  5.01(h)(iv)  unless the
Majority  Lenders shall have exercised  their right to terminate the Commitments
as provided in clause (i) of this Section 2.05(b), in which case each Borrower's
right to make a Borrowing under this Agreement shall remain  suspended until the
effective date of such  termination.  A notice of  termination  pursuant to this
Section 2.05(b) shall have the effect of accelerating  the outstanding  Advances
of the Lenders and the Notes of the Lenders and each Borrower shall, on or prior
to the effective date of the termination of the Commitments,  prepay or cause to
be prepaid the  outstanding  principal  amount of all Advances owing by any such
Borrower to the Lenders,  together with accrued

                                       20
<PAGE>

interest  thereon to the date of such  payment,  any facility fees or other fees
payable to the Lenders pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.04, and all other
amounts payable to the Lenders under this Agreement (including,  but not limited
to, any  increased  costs or other  amounts  owing  under  Section  2.11 and any
indemnification  for Taxes under Section  2.14).  Upon such  prepayment  and the
termination of the  Commitments  in accordance  with this Section  2.05(b),  the
obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement shall, by the provisions hereof,
be released and discharged.

                  (c) Increase by the Company. (i) The Company may at any time,
by notice to the Agent,  propose that the aggregate amount of the Commitments be
increased (each such proposed  increase being a "Commitment  Increase") by up to
$300,000,000  in excess of the aggregate of the  Commitments as of the Effective
Date,  effective  as at a date (the  "Commitment  Increase  Date") that shall be
specified in such notice and that shall be (A) prior to the Termination Date and
(B) at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice; provided,  however,
that (w) the Company may not propose more than one  Commitment  Increase  during
any  calendar  year,  (x) the  minimum  proposed  Commitment  Increase  for each
Commitment  Increase  Date  shall  be  $50,000,000,  (y) in no event  shall  the
aggregate  amount of the Commitments at any time exceed  $500,000,000 and (z) no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such  Commitment  Increase Date
or shall  result  from such  Commitment  Increase.  The Agent  shall  notify the
Lenders and any Eligible  Assignees  requested by the Company and  acceptable to
the Agent as potential  Assuming  Lenders  hereunder of the proposed  Commitment
Increase  promptly upon the Agent's  receipt of any such notice.  It shall be in
each Lender's sole  discretion  whether to increase its Commitment  hereunder in
connection with the proposed Commitment Increase. No later than 10 Business Days
after its  receipt  of the  Company's  notice,  each  Lender  that is willing to
increase  its  Commitment  hereunder  (each  such  Lender  being an  "Increasing
Lender")  shall  deliver  to the Agent a notice in which such  Lender  shall set
forth the maximum  increase in its Commitment to which such Lender is willing to
agree,  and the  Agent  shall  promptly  provide  to the  Company a copy of such
Increasing  Lender's  notice.  The Agent  shall  cooperate  with the  Company in
discussions with the Lenders and Eligible Assignees with a view to arranging the
proposed  Commitment  Increase through the increase of the Commitments of one or
more of the  Lenders  and/or  the  addition  of one or more  Eligible  Assignees
acceptable  to the Company  and the Agent as Assuming  Lenders and as parties to
this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the minimum  Commitment of each such
Assuming Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement  pursuant to this Section
2.05(c)  shall be  $10,000,000;  and provided  further that any  allocations  of
Commitments shall be determined by the Company.

                  (ii) If agreement is reached prior to the relevant Commitment
Increase  Date  with  any  Increasing  Lenders  and  Assuming  Lenders  as  to a
Commitment  Increase  (the  amount  of which may be less  than  (subject  to the
limitation  set forth in clause (i)(x) of this Section  2.05(c)) but not greater
than that amount  specified  in the  applicable  notice from the  Company),  the
Company shall  deliver,  no later than one Business Day prior to the  Commitment
Increase Date, a notice thereof in reasonable detail to the Agent (and the Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Lenders,  including any Assuming Lenders).  The
Assuming  Lenders,  if any, shall become Lenders  hereunder as of the Commitment
Increase Date and the  Commitments of any  Increasing  Lenders and such Assuming
Lenders  shall become or be, as the case may be, as of the  Commitment  Increase
Date, the amounts specified in the notice delivered by the Company to the Agent;
provided, however, that:

                  (x) the Agent shall have received on or prior to 9:00 A.M.
         (New York City time) on the Commitment Increase Date (A) a duly
         executed Revolving Credit Note from each Borrower, dated as of the
         Commitment Increase Date and in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1
         hereto for each Assuming Lender, and dated the date to which interest
         on the existing Revolving Credit Note of such Borrower shall have been
         paid and in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto for each
         Increasing Lender, in each case in an amount equal to the Commitment of
         each such Assuming Lender and each such Increasing Lender after giving
         effect to such Commitment Increase, (B) a certificate of a duly
         authorized officer of the Company stating that no event has occurred
         and is continuing, or would result from such Commitment Increase, that
         constitutes a Default, and that each of the other applicable conditions
         to such Commitment Increase set forth in this Section 2.05(c) to be
         fulfilled by the Company has been satisfied and (C) an opinion of
         counsel for the Company in substantially the form of Exhibit H-1
         hereto, dated the Commitment Increase Date (with copies for each
         Lender, including each Assuming Lender);

                  (y) with respect to each Assuming Lender, the Agent shall have
         received, on or prior to 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
         Commitment Increase Date, an appropriate Assumption Agreement in
         substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, duly executed by such
         Assuming Lender and the Company, and acknowledged by the Agent; and

                  (z) each Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Agent,
         on or prior to 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment
         Increase Date, (A) its existing Revolving Credit Note or Notes and (B)
         confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased
         Commitment, with a copy of such confirmation to the Company.

                  (iii) Upon its receipt of confirmation from a Lender that it
is increasing its Commitment hereunder,  together with the appropriate Revolving
Credit  Note or Notes,  certificate  and opinion  referred to in clause  (ii)(x)
above,  the Agent  shall (A) record  the  information  contained  therein in the
Register and (B) give prompt notice thereof to the Company.  Upon its receipt of
an Assumption  Agreement executed by an Assuming Lender  representing that it is
an Eligible  Assignee,  together with the appropriate  Revolving  Credit Note or
Notes,  certificate and opinion  referred to in clause (ii)(x) above,  the Agent
shall, if such Assumption  Agreement has been completed and is in  substantially
the form of Exhibit D hereto, (x) accept such Assumption  Agreement,  (y) record
the  information  contained  therein in the Register and (z) give prompt  notice
thereof to the Company.

                  (iv) In the event that the Agent shall not have received
notice  from the  Company  as to such  agreement  on or prior to the  Commitment
Increase  Date or the  Company  shall,  by  notice  to the  Agent  prior  to the
Commitment Increase Date, withdraw its proposal for a Commitment Increase or any
of the actions  provided for above in clauses  (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) shall not
have occurred by 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment Increase Date,
such  proposal  by the  Company  shall be deemed not to have been made.  In such
event, any actions theretofore taken under clauses (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) above
shall be deemed to be of no effect  and all the rights  and  obligations  of the
parties shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.

<PAGE>


                  (v) In the event that the Agent shall have received notice
from the Company as to such  agreement  on or prior to the  Commitment  Increase
Date and each of the actions  provided for in clauses  (ii)(x)  through  (ii)(z)
above shall have  occurred by 9:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the  Commitment
Increase  Date,  the Agent shall  notify the  Lenders  (including  any  Assuming
Lenders) of the occurrence of the  Commitment  Increase Date promptly and in any
event by 10:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on such date by  telecopier,  telex or
cable. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall,  before 11:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on the  Commitment  Increase  Date,  make available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in
same day funds,  in the case of such  Assuming  Lender,  an amount equal to such
Assuming  Lender's  ratable  portion of the  Revolving  Credit  Borrowings  then
outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase)
and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (i)
such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then
outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase)
over (ii) such  Increasing  Lender's  ratable  portion of the  Revolving  Credit
Borrowings then outstanding  (calculated based on its Commitment (without giving
effect to the relevant  Commitment  Increase) as a percentage  of the  aggregate
Commitments  without giving effect to the relevant Commitment  Increase).  After
the Agent's receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such
Assuming Lender, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like
funds to the  other  Lenders  for the  account  of their  respective  Applicable
Lending Offices in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount
of the outstanding  Revolving  Credit Advances owing to each Lender after giving
effect  to  such  distribution  equals  such  Lender's  ratable  portion  of the
Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding  (calculated based on such Lender's
Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving
effect to the relevant  Commitment  Increase).  If the Commitment  Increase Date
shall  occur on a date that is not the last day of the  Interest  Period for all
Eurodollar Rate Advances then outstanding, (a) the Company shall pay any amounts
owing pursuant to Section  9.04(d) as a result of the  distributions  to Lenders
under  this  Section  2.05(c)(v)  and (b) for each  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing
comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances,  the respective Revolving Credit Advances
made by the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders pursuant to this Section
2.05(c)(v)  shall be Base Rate Advances  until the last day of the then existing
Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.06. Repayment of Revolving Credit Advances. Each
Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable  account of the Lenders on the
Final  Maturity Date the  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Revolving  Credit
Advances then outstanding in respect of such Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.07. Interest on Revolving Credit Advances. (a)
Scheduled  Interest.  Each Borrower  shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal
amount of each  Revolving  Credit  Advance owing by such Borrower to each Lender
from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount shall
be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:


                                       23
<PAGE>

                  (i)  Base  Rate  Advances.   During  such  periods  as  such
               Revolving Credit Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum
               equal at all times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from
               time to time plus (y) the  Applicable  Margin in effect from time
               to time  plus (z) the  Applicable  Utilization  Fee,  if any,  in
               effect  from time to time,  payable in arrears  quarterly  on the
               last day of each March, June,  September and December during such
               periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted
               or paid in full.

                  (ii) Eurodollar  Rate Advances.  During such periods as such
               Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per
               annum  equal at all times  during each  Interest  Period for such
               Revolving  Credit Advance to the sum of (x) the  Eurodollar  Rate
               for such Interest  Period for such Revolving  Credit Advance plus
               (y) the  Applicable  Margin in effect  from time to time plus (z)
               the  Applicable  Utilization  Fee, if any, in effect from time to
               time,  payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period
               and,  if such  Interest  Period has a duration of more than three
               months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every
               three  months from the first day of such  Interest  Period and on
               the date such  Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid
               in full.

                  (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance  of an Event of Default under Section  6.01(a),  each Borrower shall
pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance
owing by such Borrower to each Lender,  payable in arrears on the dates referred
to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above,  at a rate per annum equal at all times to
2% per  annum  above the rate per annum  required  to be paid on such  Revolving
Credit  Advance  pursuant  to  clause  (a)(i) or  (a)(ii)  above and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount
payable hereunder by such Borrower that is not paid when due, from the date such
amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full,  payable in arrears
on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum
equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum  required to be paid
on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

                  (c) Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances. The
applicable  Borrower  shall pay to each Lender,  so long as such Lender shall be
required  under  regulations  of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve
System to maintain  reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of
or  including  Eurocurrency  Liabilities,  additional  interest  on  the  unpaid
principal  amount  of  each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance  of such  Lender  to such
Borrower,  from the date of such Advance until such principal  amount is paid in
full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained
by subtracting  (i) the Eurodollar  Rate for the applicable  Interest Period for
such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such  Eurodollar  Rate by a
percentage  equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar  Rate Reserve  Percentage of such
Lender  for such  Interest  Period,  payable on each date on which  interest  is
payable on such Advance.  Such  additional  interest shall be determined by such
Lender and notified in reasonable detail to such Borrower through the Agent.


                  SECTION 2.08. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference
Bank  agrees to  furnish  to the Agent  timely  information  for the  purpose of
determining  each  Eurodollar Rate and each LIBO Rate. If any one or more of the
Reference  Banks shall not furnish such timely  information to the Agent for the
purpose of determining  any such interest  rate, the Agent shall  determine such
interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining


                                       24
<PAGE>

Reference  Banks.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the relevant  Borrowers
and the Lenders of the  applicable  interest  rate  determined  by the Agent for
purposes of Section  2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by each
Reference  Bank for the purpose of  determining  the interest rate under Section
2.07(a)(ii).

                  (b) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
Majority  Lenders  notify the Agent that the  Eurodollar  Rate for any  Interest
Period for such Advances will not  adequately  reflect the cost to such Majority
Lenders of making,  funding or  maintaining  their  respective  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances  for such  Interest  Period  (which  cost each such  Lender  reasonably
determines in good faith is material),  the Agent shall forthwith so notify each
Borrower  and the  Lenders,  whereupon  (i) each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance will
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert  into a Base Rate  Advance,  and (ii) the  obligation  of the Lenders to
make, or to Convert  Revolving  Credit  Advances into,  Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders
that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  (c) If any Borrower, in requesting a Revolving Credit
Borrowing  comprised  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  shall  fail to select the
duration of the Interest  Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance
with the provisions  contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section
1.01,  the Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such
Advances  will  automatically,  on the last day of the  then  existing  Interest
Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of  Eurodollar  Rate Advances  comprising  any  Borrowing  shall be reduced,  by
payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default,  (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will  automatically,  on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance and (ii) the  obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert  Advances
into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

                  (f) If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely
information to the Agent for  determining  the Eurodollar  Rate or LIBO Rate for
any  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or LIBO Rate  Advances,  as the case may be, such
Eurodollar Rate or LIBO Rate shall be the interest rate per annum  determined by
the Agent to be the offered rate per annum at which deposits in U.S. dollars for
a maturity  comparable to the Interest  Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances
or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may be, appears on the Telerate Page 3750 (or
any  successor  page) as of 11:00 A.M.  (London time) two Business Days prior to
the first day of such  Interest  Period (the  "Telerate");  provided that if the
Telerate is not then available:

                    (i) the Agent shall forthwith  notify the relevant  Borrower
               and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be  determined  for
               such Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances,  as the case
               may be;


                                       25
<PAGE>

                    (ii) with respect to  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  each such
               Advance will automatically,  on the last day of the then existing
               Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if
               such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base
               Rate Advance); and

                    (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make  Eurodollar Rate
               Advances  or LIBO Rate  Advances or to Convert  Revolving  Credit
               Advances into  Eurodollar  Rate Advances shall be suspended until
               the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower  and the Lenders  that the
               circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                 SECTION 2.09. Optional Conversion of Revolving Credit Advances.
Any Borrower may on any Business  Day,  upon notice given to the Agent not later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed  Conversion  and subject to the  provisions of Sections 2.08 and
2.12,  Convert all Revolving  Credit  Advances of one Type  comprising  the same
Borrowing into Revolving Credit Advances of the other Type;  provided,  however,
that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be
made  only on the last  day of an  Interest  Period  for  such  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances.  Each such  notice of a  Conversion  shall,  within  the  restrictions
specified  above,  specify (i) the date of such  Conversion,  (ii) the Revolving
Credit Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar
Rate  Advances,  the  duration  of the  initial  Interest  Period  for each such
Advance.  Each  notice of  Conversion  shall be  irrevocable  and binding on the
relevant Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.10. Optional Prepayments of Revolving Credit
Advances.  Any Borrower  may, upon notice to the Agent stating the proposed date
and aggregate  principal  amount of the  prepayment,  given not later than 11:00
A.M.  (New York City time) on the second  Business Day prior to the date of such
proposed prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, and not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of such proposed  prepayment,  in the
case of Base Rate  Advances,  and, if such notice is given such Borrower  shall,
prepay  the  outstanding  principal  amount  of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
comprising  part of the same Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in whole or ratably in
part,  together  with  accrued  interest to the date of such  prepayment  on the
principal amount prepaid;  provided,  however,  that (x) each partial prepayment
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance,  such  Borrower  shall be obligated to reimburse  the
Lenders  in  respect  thereof  pursuant  to  Section  9.04(d).  Each  notice  of
prepayment  by a Designated  Subsidiary  shall be given to the Agent through the
Company.

                  SECTION 2.11. Increased Costs. (a) If, after the date hereof,
due to either (i)
the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve
Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority having jurisdiction over any Lender (whether or not
having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender
(which cost such Lender reasonably determines in good faith is material) of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances or
LIBO Rate Advances (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11 any such
increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which


                                       26
<PAGE>

Section 2.14 shall govern) and (ii) Excluded  Taxes),  then the Borrower of such
Advances shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender made not later than
60 days after such Lender obtains knowledge of such increased costs (with a copy
of such  demand to the  Agent),  pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost.
Each Lender  agrees that if such Lender  requests  compensation  for any amounts
owing from a Borrower for such increased cost under this Section  2.11(a),  such
Lender shall,  prior to a Borrower being  required to pay such increased  costs,
furnish to such Borrower a  certificate  of a senior  financial  officer of such
Lender  verifying that such increased cost was actually  incurred by such Lender
and the amount of such increased cost and setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis  therefore  (with a copy  of such  certificate  to the  Agent);  provided,
however, that such certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

                  (b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender determines that
compliance  with any law or  regulation  or any  guideline  or request  from any
central bank or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over any Lender
(whether or not having the force of law)  affects or would  affect the amount of
capital  required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling  such Lender and that the amount of such  capital is increased by or
based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other
commitments of this type,  then,  upon demand by such Lender made not later than
60 days after such Lender obtains  knowledge of such increase in capital (with a
copy of such  demand to the Agent),  the Company  shall pay to the Agent for the
account  of  such  Lender,  from  time  to time  as  specified  by such  Lender,
additional  amounts  sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in
the light of such  circumstances,  to the  extent  that such  Lender  reasonably
determines  such  increase in capital to be allocable  to the  existence of such
Lender's  commitment to lend  hereunder.  Each Lender agrees that if such Lender
requests  compensation  for any amounts owing from the Company for such increase
in capital under this Section  2.11(b),  such Lender shall,  prior to a Borrower
being required to compensate  such Lender for such increase in capital,  furnish
to the  Company a  certificate  of a senior  financial  officer  of such  Lender
verifying that such increase in capital was actually required by such Lender and
the amount of such increase in capital and setting  forth in  reasonable  detail
the basis  therefore (with a copy of such  certificate to the Agent);  provided,
however, that such certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

                  (c) No Borrower shall be obligated to pay under this Section
2.11 any amounts which relate to costs or increases of capital incurred prior to
the 12 months  immediately  preceding  the date of demand  for  payment  of such
amounts,  unless the applicable law, regulation,  guideline or request resulting
in such costs or increases of capital is imposed  retroactively.  In the case of
any law, regulation,  guideline or request which is imposed  retroactively,  the
Lender  making  demand for payment of any amount  under this  Section 2.11 shall
notify the  related  Borrower  not later than 12 months  from the date that such
Lender should reasonably have known (but promptly upon gaining knowledge of such
increase)  of such law,  regulation,  guideline  or request and such  Borrower's
obligation  to compensate  such Lender for such amount is  contingent  upon such
Lender's so notifying such Borrower; provided, however, that any failure by such
Lender to provide such notice shall not affect such Borrower's obligations under
this Section 2.11 with respect to amounts  resulting  from costs or increases of


                                       27
<PAGE>


capital incurred after the date which occurs 12 months immediately preceding the
date on which  such  Lender  notified  such  Borrower  of such law,  regulation,
guideline or request.

                  (d) If any Lender shall subsequently recoup any costs (other
than from a Borrower) for which such Lender has theretofore  been compensated by
a Borrower under this Section 2.11,  such Lender shall remit to such Borrower an
amount equal to the amount of such  recoupment as reasonably  determined by such
Lender.

                  SECTION 2.12. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement,  if any Lender shall after the date hereof,  notify the Agent
that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation  makes  it  unlawful,  or any  central  bank  or  other  governmental
authority having  jurisdiction over any Lender asserts that it is unlawful,  for
any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder
to make  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to fund or maintain
Eurodollar  Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances  hereunder,  (i) each Eurodollar
Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance, as the case may be, will automatically,  upon
such demand,  Convert into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest
at the rate set forth in  Section  2.07(a)(i),  as the case may be, and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances
or to Convert  Revolving  Credit Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  SECTION 2.13. Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrower
shall make each  payment  hereunder  and relating to the Advances not later than
1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S.  dollars to the Agent
at the Agent's  Account in same day funds.  The Agent will  promptly  thereafter
cause to be  distributed  like funds  relating  to the payment of  principal  or
interest or  facility  fees  ratably  (other than  amounts  payable  pursuant to
Section 2.03, 2.05(c),  2.07(c),  2.11, 2.14, 2.18(a) or 9.04(cd) to the Lenders
for the account of their respective  Applicable Lending Offices,  and like funds
relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender
for the account of its Applicable  Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  Agreement.  Upon  its  acceptance  of an
Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information  contained therein in
the Register  pursuant to Section  9.07(c),  from and after the  effective  date
specified in such Assignment and  Acceptance,  the Agent shall make all payments
hereunder  and  relating  to the  Advances in respect of the  interest  assigned
thereby to the Lender  assignee  thereunder,  and the parties to such Assignment
and  Acceptance  shall make all  appropriate  adjustments  in such  payments for
periods prior to such  effective  date  directly  between  themselves.  Upon any
Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of the  effectiveness of
a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.05(c),  and upon the Agent's receipt
of such Lender's  Assumption  Agreement and recording the information  contained
therein in the Register,  from and after the relevant  Increase  Date, the Agent
shall make all payments hereunder and relating to the Advances in respect of the
interest assumed thereby to such Assuming Lender.

                  (b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall
be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may
be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal
Funds  Rate and of  facility  fees  shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a
year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days


                                       28
<PAGE>


(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for
which such  interest or facility  fees are payable.  Each  determination  by the
Agent of an interest  rate  hereunder  shall be  conclusive  and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or relating to the Advances
shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee,
as the case may be;  provided,  however,  that,  if such  extension  would cause
payment of interest on or principal  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances or LIBO Rate
Advances to be made in the next following  calendar month, such payment shall be
made on the next preceding Business Day.

                  (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a
Borrower  prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders from such
Borrower  hereunder  that such Borrower will not make such payment in full,  the
Agent may assume that such  Borrower  has made such payment in full to the Agent
on such date and the Agent may, in reliance  upon such  assumption,  cause to be
distributed  to each Lender on such due date an amount  equal to the amount then
due such Lender.  If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such
payment in full to the Agent,  each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount  distributed to such Lender  together with interest  thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is  distributed  to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  SECTION 2.14. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by each Borrower
hereunder or relating to the Advances shall be made, in accordance  with Section
2.13, free and clear of and without  deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes
imposed on its overall net income,  and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of
net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political  subdivision thereof or
by any  jurisdiction  in which such  Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is
doing  business that is unrelated to this Agreement and such net income taxes or
franchise taxes that would not have been imposed if such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) had not been  conducting  such  unrelated  business and, in the
case of each  Lender,  taxes  imposed on its overall net income,  and  franchise
taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income  taxes,  by the  jurisdiction  of such
Lender's  Applicable  Lending Office or any political  subdivision  thereof (all
such excluded taxes being  hereinafter  referred to as "Excluded  Taxes" and all
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,  charges, withholdings and
liabilities  in respect of payments  hereunder or relating to the Advances being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable  hereunder or relating to
the Advances to any Lender or the Agent,  (i) the sum payable shall be increased
as may be  necessary  so that after  making all  required  deductions  for Taxes
(including deductions for Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section  2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)  receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such  deductions  been made, (ii)
such Borrower  shall make such  deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the
full amount  deducted to the relevant  taxation  authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law.

<PAGE>


                  (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar  levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or relating to the
Advances or from the execution,  delivery or registration of,  performing under,
or  otherwise  with  respect to,  this  Agreement  or  relating to the  Advances
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,  without limitation, any
taxes imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable under this Section 2.14)
imposed  on or paid by such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case may be) and any
liability for penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the
date  such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case  may be)  makes  written  demand
therefor; provided that such Lender shall, prior to a Borrower being required to
indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14(c), furnish to such Borrower
a certificate of a senior  financial  officer of such Lender verifying that such
Taxes or Other  Taxes were  actually  incurred  by such Lender and the amount of
such  Taxes or Other  Taxes and  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail the basis
therefor (with a copy of such certificate to the Agent), provided, however, that
such  certificate  shall be  conclusive  and  binding for all  purposes,  absent
manifest error.

                  (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address  referred to in Section
9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt  evidencing payment thereof.
In the case of any payment hereunder or relating to the Advances by or on behalf
of any Borrower  through an account or branch outside the United States or by or
on behalf of any Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if such
Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof,  such Borrower
shall  furnish,  or shall  cause such payor to  furnish,  to the Agent,  at such
address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment
is exempt from Taxes.  For purposes of this  subsection (d) and subsection  (e),
the terms  "United  States" and "United  States  person" shall have the meanings
specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

                  (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this  Agreement  in the case of each  Initial  Lender  and on the date of the
Assignment  and  Acceptance  or the  Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,
pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from
time to time  thereafter  as requested  in writing by any Borrower  (but only so
long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Agent and
each Borrower with two original  Internal Revenue Service forms 1001 or 4224, as
appropriate,  or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal  Revenue
Service,  certifying  that such  Lender is exempt  from or entitled to a reduced
rate of United States  withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or
relating  to the  Advances.  If the forms  provided by a Lender at the time such
Lender  first  becomes  a party to this  Agreement  indicates  a  United  States
interest  withholding  tax rate in excess of zero,  withholding tax at such rate
shall be considered  excluded  from Taxes unless and until such Lender  provides
the  appropriate  forms  certifying  that  a  lesser  rate  applies,   whereupon
withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes
for periods governed by such form;  provided,  however,  that, if at the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance or the Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,
pursuant to which a Lender


                                       30

assignee becomes a party to this Agreement,  the Lender assignor was entitled to
payments under  subsection (a) in respect of United States  withholding tax with
respect to interest  paid at such date,  then,  to such  extent,  the term Taxes
shall  include  (in  addition  to  withholding  taxes that may be imposed in the
future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding
tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.

                  (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed
to provide each Borrower with the appropriate  form described in Section 2.14(e)
(other than if such failure is due to a change in law  occurring  subsequent  to
the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form
otherwise is not required  under the first  sentence of  subsection  (e) above),
such Lender shall not be entitled to  indemnification  under Section  2.14(a) or
(c) with  respect  to Taxes  imposed  by the  United  States  by  reason of such
failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because
of its failure to deliver a form required  hereunder,  each  Borrower  agrees to
take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to
recover such Taxes.

                  (g) If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, deduction or credit of
any Taxes or Other Taxes paid or reimbursed by a Borrower pursuant to subjection
(a) or (c) above in respect of payments  under the Credit  Agreement or relating
to the Advances,  a current  monetary  benefit that it would  otherwise not have
obtained,  and that would result in the total  payments  under this Section 2.14
exceeding the amount needed to make such Lender whole,  such Lender shall pay to
such  Borrower,  with  reasonable  promptness  following  the  date on  which it
actually  realizes such benefit,  an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of
such  benefit or the amount of such excess,  in each case net of all  reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in securing such refund, deduction or credit.

                  SECTION 2.15. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall
obtain any payment (whether voluntary,  involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off,  or  otherwise) on account of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
owing to it (other  than  pursuant  to Section  2.05(c),  2.07(c),  2.11,  2.14,
2.18(a) or 9.04(d)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the
Revolving  Credit  Advances  obtained  by all the  Lenders,  such  Lender  shall
forthwith  purchase from the other Lenders such  participations in the Revolving
Credit  Advances  owing to them as shall be necessary  to cause such  purchasing
Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however,
that if all or any portion of such excess  payment is thereafter  recovered from
such  purchasing  Lender,  such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and
such  Lender  shall repay to the  purchasing  Lender the  purchase  price to the
extent of such recovery  together with an amount equal to such Lender's  ratable
share  (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's  required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the  purchasing  Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total  amount so  recovered.  Each  Borrower  agrees  that any  Lender so
purchasing a  participation  from another  Lender  pursuant to this Section 2.15
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,  exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such  participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct  creditor of such  Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

                  SECTION 2.16. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances
shall be available  (and each Borrower  agrees that it shall use such  proceeds)
solely (i) for general corporate  purposes of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries
and (ii) for  acquisitions by such Borrower that have been approved by the Board
of Directors of the corporation that is to be acquired by such Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.17. Mandatory Assignment by a Lender; Mitigation. If
any Lender  requests from a Borrower  either  payment of additional  interest on
Eurodollar  Rate Advances  pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  or  reimbursement  for
increased  costs  pursuant to Section 2.11, or payment of or  reimbursement  for
Taxes  pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender  notifies the Agent that it is
unlawful  for such  Lender  or its  Eurodollar  Lending  Office to  perform  its
obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 2.12, (i) such Lender will, upon three
Business  Days'  notice by such  Borrower to such  Lender and the Agent,  to the
extent not  inconsistent  with such Lender's  internal  policies and  applicable
legal and  regulatory  restrictions,  use  reasonable  efforts to make,  fund or
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances through another  Eurodollar Lending Office
of such Lender if (A) as a result thereof the additional  amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  2.11 or 2.14, as  applicable,  in respect of
such Eurodollar  Rate Advances would be materially  reduced or the provisions of
Section  2.12  would  not  apply  to  such  Lender,  as  applicable,  and (B) as
determined by such Lender in good faith but in its sole  discretion,  the making
or maintaining of such  Eurodollar Rate Advances  through such other  Eurodollar
Lending  Office  would  not  otherwise  materially  and  adversely  affect  such
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  or such  Lender  and (ii)  unless  such  Lender  has
therefore taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured (to the extent
not  inconsistent  with internal  policies and  applicable  legal and regulatory
restrictions),  the conditions  creating such  obligation to pay such additional
amounts or the  circumstances  described in Section 2.12, such Lender will, upon
at least five  Business  Days'  notice  from the  Company to such Lender and the
Agent,  assign,  pursuant to and in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section
9.07, to one or more Eligible  Assignees  designated by the Company all, but not
less than all, of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances then owing to such Lender and
all, but not less than all, of such Lender's  rights and  obligations  hereunder
(other  than  rights in respect of such  Lender's  outstanding  Competitive  Bid
Advance),  without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender, for a
purchase price equal to the  outstanding  principal  amount of each such Advance
then owing to such Lender plus any accrued but unpaid  interest  thereon and any
accrued but unpaid facility fees owing thereto and, in addition,  all additional
costs reimbursements,  expense reimbursements and indemnities,  if any, owing in
respect of such Lender's Commitment hereunder at such time shall be paid to such
Lender.

                  SECTION 2.18. Extension of the Termination Date and the Final
Maturity  Date. (a) Extension of the  Termination  Date. (i) The Company may, at
its option,  by written notice to the Agent in substantially the form of Exhibit
E-1  hereto,  no  earlier  than 45 days and no later  than 30 days  prior to the
Termination  Date  then  in  effect,   request  that  the  Lenders  extend  such
Termination  Date for an  additional  period of 364 days.  Such request shall be
irrevocable  and binding upon the Company.  The Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender  of  such  request.  If a  Lender  agrees,  in its  individual  and  sole
discretion,  to so extend its  Commitment  (each such Lender being an "Extending
Lender"),  it shall deliver to the Agent a written notice in  substantially  the
form of Exhibit E-2 hereto of its agreement to do so no earlier than 30 days and


                                       32
<PAGE>


no later than 20 days prior to such  Termination Date and the Agent shall notify
the  Company in  writing  of such  Extending  Lender's  agreement  to extend its
Commitment no later than 15 days prior to such Termination Date.

                  (ii) If any Lender does not consent,or fails to respond within
the time period set forth in clause (i) of this Section 2.18(a), to a request by
the Company for an extension of the  Termination  Date then in effect (each such
Lender being a "Declining Lender"), the Company shall have the right to:

                    (A)  require  any  Declining  Lender  to  assign in full its
               rights and  obligations  under this Agreement (I) to an Extending
               Lender designated by the Company that has offered to increase its
               Commitment  in an  amount  at least  equal to the  amount of such
               Declining  Lender's  Commitment  in its notice  delivered  to the
               Agent  under  subsection  (a) of this  Section  2.18  (each  such
               Extending Lender being an "Increasing Extending Lender") and (II)
               to  the  extent  of any  shortfall  in the  aggregate  amount  of
               extended  Commitments,  to any  other  Person  designated  by the
               Company and acceptable to the Agent (which  acceptance  shall not
               be  unreasonably  withheld)  that  agrees to  accept  all of such
               rights  and   obligations   (each  such  other   Person  being  a
               "Replacement  Lender"),  provided  that  (w) such  assignment  is
               otherwise in  compliance  with Section 9.07,  (x) such  Declining
               Lender receives payment in full of the aggregate principal amount
               of all Advances owing to such Declining Lender, together with all
               accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the effective date of such
               assignment  and all fees and other  accrued  and  unpaid  amounts
               owing  to such  Declining  Lender  under  any  provision  of this
               Agreement (including,  but not limited to, any increased costs or
               other additional  amounts owing under Section 2.11, and any Taxes
               or Other Taxes owing under Section 2.14) as of the effective date
               of such assignment,  (y) with respect to any Replacement  Lender,
               such Replacement Lender shall have paid the applicable processing
               and  recordation  fee  required  under  Section  9.07(a) for such
               assignment and (z) such assignment shall be effective on or prior
               to such Termination Date; or

                    (B) subject to the giving of notice to such Declining Lender
               at least five days prior to such Termination Date, pay, prepay or
               cause to be  prepaid,  on and  effective  as of such  Termination
               Date,  the aggregate  principal  amount of all Advances  owing to
               such  Declining  Lender,  together  with all  accrued  and unpaid
               interest  thereon to the date of such  payment,  and all fees and
               other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such  Declining  Lender
               under any provision of this Agreement (including, but not limited
               to, any increased costs or other  additional  amounts owing under
               Section  2.11,  and any Taxes or Other Taxes owing under  Section
               2.14) as of the date of such payment or prepayment, and terminate
               in whole such Declining Lender's Commitment,  notwithstanding the
               provisions of Section 2.05(a).

                  (iii) The Company shall, no later than one day before the
Termination Date then in effect, deliver to the Agent a notice setting forth the
Commitments of the Extending Lenders and the Replacement  Lenders, if any, which
are to become or be, as the case may be, effective as of such Termination  Date.
If Extending  Lenders  and/or  Replacement  Lenders  provide  Commitments  in an
aggregate  amount  at  least  equal  to  51%  of  the  aggregate  amount  of the
Commitments  outstanding  immediately  prior to such Termination Date, the Agent
shall give


                                       33
<PAGE>


prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and, effective as of such Termination Date,
(A) the  Termination  Date  shall be  extended  by 364  days for such  Extending
Lenders and such Replacement  Lenders,  subject,  however,  to the provisions of
subsection  (b) of this Section 2.18,  (B) each  Declining  Lender shall have no
further  Commitment  hereunder and (C) the Commitments of such Extending Lenders
and such Replacement  Lenders shall become or be, as the case may be the amounts
specified in the notice delivered by the Company to the Agent.

                  (b) Extension of the Final Maturity Date. On the Termination
Date in effect at any time, if no Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company may, by written notice to the Agent, request that the Final Maturity
Date be a date occurring up to the first  anniversary of such Termination  Date.
Such request shall be irrevocable and binding upon the Company.  The Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of such request.  Subject to the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.05 as of such Termination Date, the
Final Maturity Date shall be, effective as of such  Termination  Date, such date
as the Company shall  request  pursuant to this  subsection  (b) of this Section
2.18. In the event that the Company  shall request that the Final  Maturity Date
be a  date  occurring  up  to  the  first  anniversary  of  the  then  scheduled
Termination  Date,  and the Final Maturity Date shall be so extended as provided
in this subsection (b) of this Section 2.18, the right of the Company to request
an extension of the Termination  Date pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section
2.18 shall automatically  terminate and any extension of the Termination Date in
effect at the time such request is made that would  otherwise  occur as provided
in subsection  (a) of this Section 2.18 shall  automatically  be cancelled.  The
Agent  shall  promptly  notify each  Lender of any such  extension  of the Final
Maturity Date and any such cancellation of an extension of the Termination Date.

                  SECTION 2.19. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain
in  accordance  with its usual  practice an account or accounts  evidencing  the
indebtedness  of each  Borrower to such  Lender  resulting  from each  Revolving
Credit Advance owing to such Lender from time to time,  including the amounts of
principal  and  interest  payable  and  paid to such  Lender  from  time to time
hereunder in respect of Revolving  Credit  Advances.  Each Borrower  agrees that
upon  reasonable  notice  by any  Lender to such  Borrower  (with a copy of such
notice to the Agent) to the effect that a  Revolving  Credit Note is required or
appropriate  in order for such  Lender to  evidence  (whether  for  purposes  of
pledge,  enforcement or otherwise) the Revolving Credit Advances owing to, or to
be made by, such Lender,  such Borrower  shall  promptly  execute and deliver to
such  Lender a Revolving  Credit  Note  payable to the order of such Lender in a
principal amount up to the Commitment of such Lender.

                  (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section
9.07(d)  shall  include a control  account,  and a  subsidiary  account for each
Lender,  in which accounts  (taken  together) shall be recorded (i) the date and
amount of each Borrowing made  hereunder,  the type of Advances  comprising such
Borrowing and, if appropriate,  the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
terms of each Assumption  Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and  accepted by it,  (iii) the amount of any  principal  or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from such Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and  (iv) the  amount  of any sum  received  by the  Agent  from  each  Borrower
hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.

<PAGE>


                  (c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register
pursuant to subsection (b) above,  and by each Lender in its account or accounts
pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of
principal  and  interest  due and payable or to become due and payable from each
Borrower to, in the case of the  Register,  each Lender and, in the case of such
account or accounts,  such Lender, under this Agreement,  absent manifest error;
provided,  however,  that the  failure  of the  Agent or such  Lender to make an
entry,  or any  finding  that an entry is  incorrect,  in the  Register  or such
account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise  affect the  obligations of any
Borrower under this Agreement.

of the Agent  responsible  for the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
shall have received  notice from such Lender prior to the date that the Company,
by notice to the Lenders,  designates as the proposed Effective Date, specifying
its  objection  thereto.  The Agent  shall  promptly  notify the  Lenders of the
occurrence of the Effective Date.

          binding on or affecting the Company,  except where such  contravention
          would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (c) No  authorization  or  approval  or other  action  by, and no
          notice to or filing with,  any  governmental  authority or  regulatory

          hereto, all of which have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and

          receive, take or make such authorization,  approval, action, notice or
          filing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (d) This Agreement has been, and each of the Notes of the Company
          to be delivered by it when delivered  hereunder  will have been,  duly
          executed and delivered by the Company.  This Agreement is, and each of

          periods ended on such dates,  all in accordance  with  accounting
          principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  consistently
          applied; provided,  however, that said balance sheet and statements of
          income and cash flows for the six months  ended as at July 1, 2001 are
          instead  prepared in accordance with applicable  rules and regulations
          of the  Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Since December 31, 2000,

          threatened  action,  suit,  investigation,  litigation or  proceeding,
          including, without limitation, any Environmental Action, affecting the
          Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  before  any  court,  governmental
          agency or  arbitrator  that (A) would be  reasonably  likely to have a
          Material  Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed  Litigation) or (B)
          purports to affect the legality,  validity or  enforceability  of this
          Agreement  or  any  Note  or  the  consummation  of  the  transactions
          contemplated  hereby, and (ii) there has been no adverse change in the
          status, or financial effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken
          as a  whole,  of the  Disclosed  Litigation  from  that  described  on
          Schedule 3.01(b) hereto.

               (g) No proceeds of any Advance will be applied in any manner that
          will violate or cause any Lender to violate Regulation U or Regulation
          G issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

               (h) The Company is not, and immediately  after the application by
          the  Company  of  the  proceeds  of  each  Advance  will  not  be,  an
          "investment  company",  or a company  "controlled"  by an  "investment
          company",  as such terms are defined in the Investment  Company Act of
          1940, as amended.

               (i) The Company and each of its  Subsidiaries  are in  compliance
          with all applicable laws,  rules,  regulations and orders,  including,
          without  limitation,  ERISA and  Environmental  Laws and Environmental
          Permits, except where the failure to so comply would not be reasonably
          likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (j) To the Company's knowledge,  (i) all past non-compliance with
          any  Environmental  Laws and  Environmental  Permits has been resolved
          without  ongoing  obligations  or costs except where the failure to so
          comply  would  not be  reasonably  likely to have a  Material  Adverse
          Effect and (ii) no circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely
          to (A) form the basis of an  Environmental  Action against the Company
          or any of its  Subsidiaries  or any of their  properties that would be
          reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect or (B) cause any
          such  property  to  be  subject  to  any  restrictions  on  ownership,
          occupancy,  use or  transferability  under any  Environmental Law that
          would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (k) No ERISA  Event  that  would be  reasonably  likely to have a
          Material  Adverse  Effect has  occurred or is  reasonably  expected to
          occur with respect to any Plan.

(l)      Schedule B (Actuarial Information) to the most recent annual report
         (Form 5500 Series) for each Plan whose "funded current liability
         percentage" is less than 90% and whose "unfunded current liability"
         exceeds $5,000,000 (as such terms are defined in

          Section 302(d)(8) of ERISA), copies of which have been filed with
          the Internal Revenue Service and furnished to the Lenders, is complete
          and accurate and fairly presents in all material  respects the funding
          status of such Plan.

               (m) Neither the Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate has  outstanding
          liability  with  respect  to, or is  reasonably  expected to incur any
          Withdrawal   Liability  to,  any  Multiemployer  Plan  that  would  be
          reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (n) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified
          by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer Plan is
          in reorganization or has been terminated,  within the meaning of Title
          IV of ERISA, and no such Multiemployer Plan is reasonably  expected to
          be in reorganization or to be terminated,  within the meaning of Title
          IV of  ERISA,  where  such  reorganization  or  termination  would  be
          reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (o) Except as set forth in the financial  statements  referred to
          in  Section  4.01(e)  and in  Section  5.01(h),  the  Company  and its
          Subsidiaries  taken as a whole have no material liability with respect
          to "expected post retirement benefit  obligations"  within the meaning
          of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106.

                  SECTION 5.01.  Affirmative Covenants.  So long as any Advance
shall  remain  unpaid or any Lender  shall have any  Commitment  hereunder,  the
Company will:

               (a) Compliance with Laws,  Obligations,  Etc.  Comply,  and cause
          each of its Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects, with all
          applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations and orders,  such compliance to
          include,  without limitation,  compliance with ERISA and Environmental
          Laws as provided in Section  5.01(i),  except  where the failure to so
          comply  would  not be  reasonably  likely to have a  Material  Adverse
          Effect.

               (b) Payment of Taxes,  Etc. Pay and discharge,  and cause each of
          its  Subsidiaries  to pay and discharge,  before the same shall become
          delinquent if the failure to so pay and discharge  would be reasonably
          likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,  (i) all taxes,  assessments
          and  governmental  charges  or  levies  imposed  upon it or  upon  its
          property  and (ii) all lawful  claims  that,  if  unpaid,  will by law
          become a Lien upon its property;  provided,  however, that neither the
          Company  nor  any of its  Subsidiaries  shall  be  required  to pay or
          discharge  any such tax,  assessment,  charge  or claim  that is being
          contested  in good  faith  and by proper  proceedings  and as to which
          appropriate reserves are being maintained.

               (c)  Maintenance  of Insurance.  Maintain,  and cause each of its
          Material  Subsidiaries  to maintain,  insurance with  responsible  and
          reputable insurance companies or associations (or continue to maintain
          self-insurance)  in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
          carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning


                                       42
<PAGE>


          similar properties in the same general areas in which the Company
          or such Subsidiary operates.

               (d)  Preservation  of  Corporate  Existence,  Etc.  Preserve  and
          maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain,
          its  corporate   existence,   rights   (charter  and   statutory)  and
          franchises;  provided,  however, that the Company and its Subsidiaries
          may consummate  any merger or  consolidation  permitted  under Section
          5.02(b) and  provided  further that neither the Company nor any of its
          Subsidiaries  shall be required to preserve  any right or franchise if
          the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  or such  Subsidiary  shall
          determine that the preservation  thereof is no longer desirable in the
          conduct of the business of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case
          may be, and that the loss thereof  would not be  reasonably  likely to
          have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (e) Authorizations.  Obtain, and cause each Designated Subsidiary
          with a  principal  place of  business  outside  the  United  States to
          obtain,  at any  time  and  from  time  to  time  all  authorizations,
          licenses, consents or approvals (including exchange control approvals)
          as shall now or hereafter be necessary or desirable  under  applicable
          law or regulations  in connection  with such  Designated  Subsidiary's
          making and  performance of this Agreement and, upon the request of any
          Lender, promptly furnish to such Lender copies thereof.

               (f)  Keeping  of  Books.  Keep,  and cause  each of its  Material
          Subsidiaries  with a principal  place of business in the United States

               reasonably  likely to incur liability in excess of $75,000,000 in
               the  aggregate as a result of one or more of the  following:  (i)
               the  occurrence of any ERISA Event;  (ii) the partial or complete
               withdrawal of the Company or any of its ERISA  Affiliates  from a
               Multiemployer Plan; or (iii) the reorganization or termination of
               a Multiemployer Plan; or

                    (h) Any ERISA Event shall have  occurred  with  respect to a
               Plan and the sum (determined as of the date of occurrence of such
               ERISA  Event)  of  the   Insufficiency   of  such  Plan  and  the
               Insufficiency of any and all other Plans with respect to which an
               ERISA Event shall have  occurred and then exist (or the liability
               of the  Company  and the ERISA  Affiliates  related to such ERISA
               Event) exceeds $75,000,000; or

                    (i) The  Company  or any  ERISA  Affiliate  shall  have been
               notified  by the  sponsor  of a  Multiemployer  Plan  that it has
               incurred  Withdrawal  Liability to such  Multiemployer Plan in an
               amount that, when  aggregated with all other amounts  required to
               be paid to  Multiemployer  Plans  by the  Company  and the  ERISA
               Affiliates as Withdrawal Liability  (determined as of the date of
               such notification), exceeds $75,000,000; or

                    (j) The  Company  or any  ERISA  Affiliate  shall  have been
               notified  by  the  sponsor  of a  Multiemployer  Plan  that  such
               Multiemployer  Plan is in  reorganization or is being terminated,
               within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA,  and as a result of such
               reorganization or termination the aggregate annual  contributions
               of the  Company  and the ERISA  Affiliates  to all  Multiemployer
               Plans that are then in reorganization or being


                                       48
<PAGE>


               terminated  have been or will be increased  over the amounts
               contributed  to such  Multiemployer  Plans for the plan  years of
               such Multiemployer  Plans immediately  preceding the plan year in
               which  such  reorganization  or  termination  occurs by an amount
               exceeding $75,000,000 in the aggregate;

then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the
consent,  of the  Majority  Lenders,  by notice to the  Company  and each  other
Borrower,  declare  the  obligation  of  each  Lender  to  make  Advances  to be
terminated,  whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the
request,  or may with the  consent,  of the Majority  Lenders,  by notice to the
Company and each other Borrower,  declare the Advances, all interest thereon and
all other amounts  payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable,
whereupon the Advances,  all such interest and all such amounts shall become and
be forthwith due and payable,  without presentment,  demand,  protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby  expressly  waived by the Borrowers;
provided,  however,  that in the event of an actual or deemed  entry of an order
for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Federal  Bankruptcy  Code, (A)
the  obligation  of each Lender to make  Advances to such  Borrower (or, if such
event has occurred in respect of the Company,  to make Advances to any Borrower)
shall  automatically  be terminated and (B) the Advances,  all such interest and
all such  amounts  owing by such  Borrower  (or,  if such event has  occurred in
respect  of the  Company,  owing by all of the  Borrowers)  shall  automatically
become  and be due and  payable,  without  presentment,  demand,  protest or any
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers.

                                  Article VII

                                    GUARANTY

                  SECTION 7.01. Guaranty. For valuable consideration, receipt
whereof is hereby  acknowledged,  and to induce each Lender to make  Advances to
the  Designated  Subsidiaries  and to  induce  the Agent to act  hereunder,  the
Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each Lender and the
Agent the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise, of all obligations of the Designated Subsidiaries now or hereafter
existing  under this Agreement or the Notes,  whether for  principal,  interest,
fees, indemnities, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "Guaranteed
Obligations"),  and agrees to pay any and all reasonable and documented expenses
(including  reasonable  counsel fees and expenses)  incurred by the Agent or any
Lender in  enforcing  any  rights  under this  Guaranty.  Without  limiting  the
generality of the foregoing, the Company's liability shall extend to all amounts
that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and that would be owed by any
Designated  Subsidiary  to the Agent or any Lender under this  Agreement and the
Notes but for the fact that such Guaranteed Obligations are unenforceable or not
allowable  due to the  existence  of a  bankruptcy,  reorganization  or  similar
proceeding involving such Designated Subsidiary.

                  SECTION 7.02. Guaranty Absolute. The Company guarantees that
the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this  Agreement  regardless of any law,  regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the  rights of the
Agent or any Lender with respect  thereto.  The obligations of the Company under
this  Guaranty  are  independent  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or any  other
obligations of any Designated Subsidiary under this Agreement and the Notes, and
a separate


                                       49
<PAGE>


action or actions may be brought and  prosecuted  against the Company to enforce
the obligations of the Company under this Guaranty,  irrespective of whether any
action is brought  against any Borrower or whether any Borrower is joined in any
such action or actions.  The liability of the Company under this Guaranty  shall
be  irrevocable,  absolute and  unconditional  irrespective  of, and the Company
hereby  irrevocably  waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have in any way
relating to, any or all of the following:

                    (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
               or the  Notes,  or any other  agreement  or  instrument  relating
               thereto;

                    (b) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment  of,
               or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations
               or any other obligations of any Designated  Subsidiary under this
               Agreement  or the Notes,  or any other  amendment or waiver of or
               any  consent  to  departure  from  this  Agreement  or any  Note,
               including,  without  limitation,  any increase in the  Guaranteed
               Obligations  resulting from the extension of additional credit to
               any  Designated   Subsidiary  or  any  of  its   Subsidiaries  or
               otherwise;

                    (c) any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent
               to  departure  from  any  other  guaranty,  for all or any of the
               Guaranteed Obligations;

                    (d)  any  change,   restructuring   or  termination  of  the
               corporate structure or existence of any Designated  Subsidiary or
               any of its Subsidiaries;

                    (e) any  failure of the Agent or any Lender to  disclose  to
               the Company or any Designated Subsidiary any information relating
               to the financial condition,  operations,  properties or prospects
               of any  Designated  Subsidiary  now or in the future known to the
               Agent or such Lender, as the case may be (the Company waiving any
               duty on the part of the Agent or the  Lenders  to  disclose  such
               information); or

                    (f) any other circumstance  (including,  without limitation,
               any statute of  limitations)  or any  existence of or reliance on
               any  representation  by  the  Agent  or  any  Lender  that  might
               otherwise  constitute a defense  available to, or a discharge of,
               any Designated  Subsidiary or the Company or any other  guarantor
               or surety.

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Designated Subsidiary or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

                  SECTION 7.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) The Company
hereby waives promptness,  diligence,  notice of acceptance and any other notice
with  respect to any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and this  Guaranty and any
requirement  that the Agent or any Lender  exhaust  any right or take any action
against any Designated Subsidiary or any other Person, and all other notices and
demands whatsoever.


                                       50
<PAGE>


                    (b) The  Company  hereby  waives  any right to  revoke  this
Guaranty,  and  acknowledges  that this  Guaranty  is  continuing  in nature and
applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

                    (c)  The   Company   acknowledges   that  it  will   receive
substantial  direct  and  indirect  benefits  from  the  financing  arrangements
contemplated  by this  Agreement and the Notes and that the waivers set forth in
this Section 7.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

                  SECTION 7.04. Subrogation. The Company will not exercise any
rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against any Designated Subsidiary or
any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence,  payment, performance
or enforcement of the Company's obligations under this Guaranty or any provision
of this  Agreement or the Notes,  including,  without  limitation,  any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any
right to  participate  in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against
such  Designated  Subsidiary or any other insider  guarantor or any  collateral,
whether or not such claim,  remedy or right arises in equity or under  contract,
statute  or common  law,  including,  without  limitation,  the right to take or
receive from such Designated Subsidiary or any other insider guarantor, directly
or  indirectly,  in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim,  remedy or right, unless and until
all of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other  amounts  payable  under this
Guaranty  shall  have been paid in full in cash and the  Commitments  shall have
expired or  terminated.  If any amount shall be paid to the Company in violation
of the preceding  sentence at any time prior to the later of the payment in full
in cash of the Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty and the Final Maturity Date, such amount shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Agent and Lenders and shall  forthwith be paid to the Agent to be
credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable
under this Guaranty,  whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and any Notes,  or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed
Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty  thereafter arising. If
(i) the Company shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all or any part
of the Guaranteed  Obligations,  (ii) all of the Guaranteed  Obligations and all
other  amounts  payable  under this  Guaranty  shall be paid in full in cash and
(iii) the Final  Maturity  Date shall have  occurred,  the Agent and the Lenders
will, at the Company's  request and expense,  execute and deliver to the Company
appropriate documents,  without recourse and without representation or warranty,
necessary to evidence the transfer by  subrogation to the Company of an interest
in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment by the Company.

                  SECTION 7.05. Continuing Guaranty; Assignments Under the
Credit Agreement. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in
full  force and  effect  until the later of the  payment  in full in cash of the
Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts  payable under this Agreement and
the Final  Maturity  Date,  (b) be binding upon the Company,  its successors and
assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable by the Agent and the
Lenders  and their  respective  successors,  transferees  and  assigns.  Without
limiting the  generality of the  foregoing  clause (c), any Lender may assign or
otherwise  transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations  under this
Agreement (including,  without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitment,
the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person,


                                       51
<PAGE>



and such other Person  shall  thereupon  become  vested with all the benefits in
respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise,  in each case as and
to the extent provided in Section 9.07 of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 7.06. No Stay. The Company agrees that, as between (a)
the Company and (b) the Lenders and the Agent, the Guaranteed Obligations of any
Designated  Subsidiary guaranteed by the Company hereunder may be declared to be
forthwith  due and payable as provided in Article VI hereof for purposes of this
Guaranty by  declaration to the Company as guarantor  notwithstanding  any stay,
injunction or other  prohibition  preventing  such  declaration  as against such
Designated  Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration to the Company
as guarantor,  such  Guaranteed  Obligations  (whether or not due and payable by
such  Designated  Subsidiary),  shall  forthwith  become due and  payable by the
Company for purposes of this Guaranty.

                                  Article VIII

                                    THE AGENT

                  SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers and discretion  under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Agent by the terms hereof,  together with such powers and  discretion as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including, without limitation,  enforcement or collection of the
Advances),  the Agent shall not be required to exercise any  discretion  or take
any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Majority Lenders,  and such  instructions  shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all  holders of  Advances;  provided,  however,  that the Agent shall not be
required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this  Agreement  or  applicable  law. The Agent agrees to give to
each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by any Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.02. Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any
of its directors,  officers,  agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or  omitted  to be taken by it or them  under or in  connection  with this
Agreement,  except for its or their own gross negligence or willful  misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing,  the Agent: (a) may treat
the Lender that made any Advance as the holder of the Debt  resulting  therefrom
until the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment  and Acceptance  entered into
by such Lender, as assignor,  and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided
in Section 9.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel  (including  counsel for any
Borrower),  independent  public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance  with the advice of such counsel,  accountants or experts;  (c)
makes no warranty or  representation  to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection  with this  Agreement;  (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the  performance  or  observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of any Borrower
or to inspect the property  (including  the books and records) of any  Borrower;
(e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,


                                       52
<PAGE>


legality, validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (f)
shall incur no  liability  under or in respect of this  Agreement by acting upon
any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by
telecopier,  telegram or telex)  believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent
by the proper party or parties.

                  SECTION 8.03. Citibank and Affiliates. With respect to its
Commitment,  the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it,  Citibank  shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise  the same as though it were not the  Agent;  and the term  "Lender"  or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly  indicated,  include Citibank in its
individual capacity.  Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money  to,  act as  trustee  under  indentures  of,  accept  investment  banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company,
any  of its  Subsidiaries  and  any  Person  who  may do  business  with  or own
securities  of the Company or any such  Subsidiary,  all as if Citibank were not
the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

                  SECTION 8.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has,  independently  and  without  reliance  upon the Agent or any other
Lender and based on the  financial  statements  referred to in Section  4.01 and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,  made its own
credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such  documents and  information  as it shall deem
appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.05. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify
the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by a Borrower), ratably according to the
respective  principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Notes then held by each of
them (or if no  Revolving  Credit  Notes are at the time  outstanding  or if any
Revolving  Credit  Notes  are  held by  Persons  that are not  Lenders,  ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments),  from and against any
and  all  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  or  disbursements  of any  kind or  nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in
any way  relating to or arising  out of this  Agreement  or any action  taken or
omitted by the Agent  under this  Agreement,  provided  that no Lender  shall be
liable  for any  portion  of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without limitation of
the  foregoing,  each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent  promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any  out-of-pocket  expenses  (including  counsel fees)
incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration,   modification,   amendment  or  enforcement   (whether  through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities  under, this Agreement,  to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by a Borrower.

                  SECTION 8.06. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any
time by giving  written  notice thereof to the Lenders and each Borrower and may
be removed at any time with or without  cause by the  Majority  Lenders and such
resignation  or removal shall be effective  upon the  appointment of a successor
Agent. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority


                                       53
<PAGE>


Lenders  shall  have the right to  appoint a  successor  Agent,  subject  to the
Company's approval (which shall not be unreasonably  withheld).  If no successor
Agent  shall have been so  appointed  by the  Majority  Lenders,  and shall have
accepted such  appointment,  within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or the Majority  Lenders'  removal of the retiring  Agent,
then the  retiring  Agent may,  on behalf of the  Lenders,  appoint a  successor
Agent,  which shall be a commercial  bank organized under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State  thereof  and  having a combined  capital  and
surplus of at least $250,000,000, subject to the Company's approval (which shall
not be unreasonably  withheld).  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent,  such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties
of the retiring  Agent,  and the  retiring  Agent shall be  discharged  from its
duties  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement.  After  any  retiring  Agent's
resignation or removal  hereunder as Agent,  the provisions of this Article VIII
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under this Agreement.

                                   Article IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this  Agreement or the Revolving  Credit Notes,  nor consent to any
departure by any Borrower therefrom,  shall in any event be effective unless the
same  shall be in  writing  and signed by the  Majority  Lenders,  and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided,  however, that no amendment,  waiver
or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any of the
following: (a) increase the Commitment of any Lender (other than as provided for
in Section  2.05(c) or Section  2.18(a)) or subject any Lender to any additional
monetary obligations, (b) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Revolving
Credit Notes or any fees or other amounts  payable  hereunder,  (c) postpone any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Credit
Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than as provided for
under Section 2.18),  (d) release the Company from any of its obligations  under
Article VII or limit the  liability  of the Company  thereunder  or (e) amend or
waive this Section 9.01 or the  definition of "Majority  Lenders";  and provided
further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by the Agent in  addition  to the Lenders  required  above to take such  action,
affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any Note.

                  SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of
any  Lender  or the Agent to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any right
hereunder  or under any Note shall  operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any
single or  partial  exercise  of any such  right  preclude  any other or further
exercise  thereof  or the  exercise  of any other  right.  The  remedies  herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Company agrees to
pay or cause to be paid on  demand  all  reasonable  and  documented  costs  and
expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration,  modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  (A)
all due  diligence,  syndication  (including  printing,  distribution  and  bank
meetings),  transportation,  computer, duplication, messenger costs and expenses
and (B) the  reasonable  fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect
thereto  and  with   respect  to  advising  the  Agent  as  to  its  rights  and
responsibilities  under this  Agreement.  The Company  further  agrees to pay or
cause to be paid on demand all reasonable  and documented  costs and expenses of
the Agent and the Lenders,  if any (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable
counsel fees and expenses),  in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement,  the Notes and
the other documents to be delivered  hereunder,  including,  without limitation,
reasonable  fees and  expenses  of  counsel  for the  Agent  and each  Lender in
connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 9.04(a).

                  (b) The Company  agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Agent  and  each  Lender  and  each of  their  Affiliates  and  their  officers,
directors,  employees,  agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified  Party") from
and  against any and all  claims,  damages,  losses,  liabilities  and  expenses
(including,  without  limitation,  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that
may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each
case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with
the  preparation for a defense of, any  investigation,  litigation or proceeding
arising out of, related to or in connection with the Notes, this Agreement,  any
of the  transactions  contemplated  herein or the actual or proposed  use of the
proceeds  of the  Advances  whether  or not such  investigation,  litigation  or
proceeding  is  brought  by any  Borrower  or  the  directors,  shareholders  or
creditors  of any  Borrower or an  Indemnified  Party or any other Person or any
Indemnified  Party  is  otherwise  a  party  thereto  and  whether  or  not  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby are  consummated,  except to the extent  such
claim,


                                       55
<PAGE>


damage,  loss,  liability or expense results from such Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice
of the  commencement  of any action or proceeding  involving any claim,  damage,
loss or liability  referred to in paragraph (b) above,  such  Indemnified  Party
will,  if a claim in respect  thereof is to be made against any  Borrower,  give
written  notice to such Borrower of the  commencement  of such action;  provided
that the  failure of any  Indemnified  Party to give  notice as provided in this
Section  9.04(c)  shall not  relieve  such  Borrower  of its  obligations  under
paragraph  (b) above,  except  only to the extent  that such  Borrower  actually
suffers  damage solely as a result of such failure to give notice.  In the event
that any such action or  proceeding  is brought  against an  Indemnified  Party,
unless in such Indemnified  Party's sole judgment (based on advise of counsel) a
conflict of interest between such Indemnified  Party and a Borrower may exist in
respect thereof, such Borrower shall be entitled to participate in and to assume
the defense thereof with counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to such  Indemnified
Party. After notice from such Borrower to such Indemnified Party of its election
to  assume  the  defense  thereof,  such  Borrower  shall  not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified  Party in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable
costs of investigation). No Borrower shall consent to the entry of any dismissal
or judgment, or enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened action or
proceeding  against any Indemnified Party that is or could have been a party and
for whom indemnity  could have been sought under paragraph (b) above without the
consent of such Indemnified Party unless such judgment,  dismissal or settlement
includes  as an  unconditional  term  thereof  the giving of a release  from all
liability in respect of such action or  proceeding  to such  Indemnified  Party;
provided that each  Indemnified  Party agrees that, if a Borrower  reconfirms to
such  Indemnified  Party that it is indemnified from all liability in respect of
any such  action or  proceeding  referred  to in the  preceding  sentence,  such
Indemnified  Party  will not enter  into any  settlement  of any such  action or
proceeding  without the consent of such  Borrower  (which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld).  In addition to the foregoing,  each Borrower shall not,
in assuming  the defense of any  Indemnified  Party,  agree to any  dismissal or
settlement  without the prior written consent of such Indemnified  Party if such
dismissal or settlement  (A) would require any admission or  acknowledgement  of
culpability or wrongdoing by such Indemnified Party or (B) would provide for any
nonmonetary relief to any Persons to be performed by such Indemnified Party.

                  (d) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance or LIBO Rate Advance is made by any Borrower to or for
the account of a Lender  other than on the last day of the  Interest  Period for
such  Advance,  as a result of (i) a payment or  Conversion  pursuant to Section
2.03(d),  2.10, 2.12 or 2.18(a),  (ii) a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section
2.05(c),  (iii) acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section
6.01 or for any other reason,  or (iv) by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender other
than on the last day of the Interest  Period for such Advance upon an assignment
of rights and obligations under this Agreement  pursuant to Section 9.07(a) as a
result of a demand by the Company pursuant to Section 2.17, such Borrower shall,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the
Agent for the  account of such Lender any amounts  required to  compensate  such
Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may


                                       56
<PAGE>


reasonably  and  actually  incur  as a result  of such  payment  or  Conversion,
including,  without  limitation,  any  loss  (other  than  loss  of  anticipated
profits),  cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment
of  deposits or other  funds  acquired  by any Lender to fund or  maintain  such
Advance.

                  (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of any Borrower  hereunder,  the  agreements  and  obligations  of such Borrower
contained in Sections  2.11,  2.14 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of
principal,  interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and relating to the
Advances.

                  SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request
or the granting of the consent  specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent
to declare the Advances due and payable  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section
6.01, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  to set off and apply  any and all  deposits
(general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final but excluding  trust
accounts)  at any time held and  other  indebtedness  at any time  owing by such
Lender to or for the credit or the account of any  Borrower  against any and all
of the  obligations  of such  Borrower  now or  hereafter  existing  under  this
Agreement and the Note of such Borrower held by such Lender, whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note. Each Lender
agrees  promptly  to notify the  relevant  Borrower  after any such  set-off and
application,  provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and  application.  The rights of each Lender under this
Section  are in  addition  to other  rights  and  remedies  (including,  without
limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become
effective  (other than Sections 2.01 and 2.03, which shall only become effective
upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it
shall have been  executed  by the Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall
have been notified by each Initial  Lender that such Initial Lender has executed
it and  thereafter  shall be  binding  upon and  inure  to the  benefit  of each
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns,
except that no Borrower  shall have the right to assign its rights  hereunder or
any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

                  SECTION 9.07. Assignments, Designations and Participations.
(a) Each Lender may at any time,  and if  demanded  by the  Company  pursuant to
Section 2.17, shall assign to one or more Persons all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement  (including,  without limitation,  all or a
portion of its  Commitment,  the Revolving  Credit  Advances owing to it and the
Revolving  Credit Note or Notes held by it);  provided,  however,  that (i) each
such  assignment  shall be of a constant,  and not a varying,  percentage of all
rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (other  than any right to make
Competitive  Bid Advances,  Competitive Bid Advances owing to it and Competitive
Bid  Notes),  (ii)  except  in the  case  of an  assignment  to a  Person  that,
immediately prior to such assignment,  was a Lender or an assignment of all of a
Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of the
Commitment  of the  assigning  Lender  being  assigned  pursuant  to  each  such
assignment  (determined as of the date of the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than


                                       57
<PAGE>


$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,  (iii) each
such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made
as a result  of a demand  by the  Company  pursuant  to  Section  2.17  shall be
arranged by the Company after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an
assignment of all of the rights and  obligations  of the assigning  Lender under
this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made
concurrently  with  another  such  assignment  or other  such  assignments  that
together cover all of the rights and  obligations of the assigning  Lender under
this Agreement,  (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as
a result of a demand by the Company  pursuant  to Section  2.17 (A) so long as a
Default shall have occurred and be continuing,  (B) unless and until such Lender
shall have  received one or more  payments  from either the  Company,  any other
Borrower or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal
to the  aggregate  outstanding  principal  amount of the Advances  owing to such
Lender,  together with accrued  interest  thereon to the date of payment of such
principal  amount  and all other  amounts  payable  to such  Lender  under  this
Agreement  (including,  but not limited to, any amounts owing under Section 2.11
and  Section  2.14),  and the  Company  shall  have  satisfied  all of its other
obligations  under this Agreement as of the effective date of the assignment and
(C) if any such Eligible  Assignee is not an existing Lender,  the Company shall
have paid to the Agent a  processing  and  recordation  fee of $1,000,  (vi) the
parties to each such assignment  shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with  any  Revolving  Credit  Note  subject  to  such  assignment  and,  if such
assignment  does not occur as a result of a demand by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section  2.17 (in which case the  Company  shall pay the fee  required by clause
(v)(C) of this Section 9.07(a)), a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and
(vii) in the case of an  assignment  to any  Affiliate  of such  Lender  that is
engaged in the business of commercial  banking,  notice  thereof shall have been
given to the Company and the Agent.  Upon such execution,  delivery,  acceptance
and recording,  from and after the effective  date specified in each  Assignment
and Acceptance,  (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and  obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder  and (y) the Lender  assignor  thereunder  shall,  to the extent  that
rights and  obligations  hereunder  have been  assigned  by it  pursuant to such
Assignment  and  Acceptance,  relinquish  its  rights and be  released  from its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the  case  of an  Assignment  and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender  shall cease to be a party
hereto).

                  (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the Lender assignor  thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each  other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:  (i) other  than as
provided in such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  such  assigning  Lender makes no
representation  or warranty  and assumes no  responsibility  with respect to any
statements,  warranties or  representations  made in or in connection  with this
Agreement or the execution,  legality,  validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,
sufficiency  or value of this  Agreement  or any other  instrument  or  document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility  with respect to the financial  condition
of any Borrower or the  performance  or observance by any Borrower of any of its
obligations  under this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished
pursuant  hereto;  (iii) such  assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of
this


                                       58
<PAGE>


Agreement,  together  with  copies of the  financial  statements  referred to in
Section  4.01(e),  the most recent financial  statements  referred to in Section
5.01(h) and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
make its own credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into such  Assignment  and
Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit  decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement;  (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible  Assignee;  (vi) such assignee appoints
and  authorizes  the Agent to take such  action  as agent on its  behalf  and to
exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms  hereof,  together  with such  powers and  discretion  as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto;  and (vii) such  assignee  agrees  that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations  that by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an  assigning  Lender and an  assignee  representing  that it is an  Eligible
Assignee,  together  with any  Revolving  Credit  Note or Notes  subject to such
assignment,  the  Agent  shall,  if such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  has  been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto,  (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance,  (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to each Borrower.

                  (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance  delivered to and accepted
by it and a  register  for the  recordation  of the names and  addresses  of the
Lenders and the  Commitment  of, and principal  amount of the Advances owing to,
each Lender  from time to time (the  "Register").  The  entries in the  Register
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,  absent  manifest  error,  and
each  Borrower,  the Agent and the Lenders  may treat each Person  whose name is
recorded  in the  Register  as a  Lender  hereunder  for  all  purposes  of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower or any
Lender  at any  reasonable  time and from  time to time  upon  reasonable  prior
notice.

                  (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks
or other  entities  (other than any Borrower or any of its  Affiliates) in or to
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement  (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it
and any Note or Notes held by it);  provided,  however,  that (i) such  Lender's
obligations under this Agreement (including,  without limitation, its Commitment
to any Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely  responsible  to the other  parties  hereto for the  performance  of such
obligations,  (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement,  (iv) each Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders
shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection  with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant
under any such  participation  shall have any right to approve any  amendment or
waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement  or any Note,  or any consent to any
departure by any Borrower  therefrom,  except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Advances or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,  in each case to the extent subject
to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment


                                       59
<PAGE>


of  principal  of, or interest  on, the  Advances  or any fees or other  amounts
payable  hereunder,  in each case to the extent  subject to such  participation.
Each  Lender  agrees  that,  promptly  upon  selling any such  participation  in
accordance with this Section  9.07(e),  such Lender shall deliver written notice
thereof to the Company.

(                 f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed  assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section
9.07,  disclose  to the  assignee,  or  participant  or  proposed  assignee,  or
participant,  any  information  relating  to the  Company or any other  Borrower
furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower;  provided that, prior
to any such  disclosure,  the assignee,  or participant or proposed  assignee or
participant  shall agree to preserve  the  confidentiality  of any  Confidential
Information relating to such Borrower received by it from such Lender.

                  (g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement,  any Lender may at any time create a security  interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  the
Advances  owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any  Federal
Reserve Bank in  accordance  with  Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

                  SECTION 9.08. Designated Subsidiaries. (a) Designation. The
Company  may at any time,  and from time to time,  by delivery to the Agent of a
Designation  Letter duly executed by the Company and the  respective  Subsidiary
and substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto,  designate such Subsidiary as
a "Designated  Subsidiary"  for purposes of this  Agreement and such  Subsidiary
shall thereupon become a "Designated  Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement
and,  as such,  shall  have all of the  rights  and  obligations  of a  Borrower
hereunder.  The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each such designation
by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary.

                  (b) Termination. Upon the payment and performance in full of
all of the  indebtedness,  liabilities and obligations  under this Agreement and
relating to the Advances of any  Designated  Subsidiary  then, so long as at the
time no Notice of  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  or  Notice of  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing  in  respect  of  such  Designated  Subsidiary  is  outstanding,  such
Subsidiary's status as a "Designated  Subsidiary" shall terminate upon notice to
such  effect from the Agent to the  Lenders  (which  notice the Agent shall give
promptly upon its receipt of a request  therefor from the Company).  Thereafter,
the Lenders shall be under no further  obligation to make any Advance  hereunder
to such Designated Subsidiary.

                  SECTION 9.09. Confidentiality. Neither the Agent nor any
Lender shall disclose any  Confidential  Information to any other Person without
the  consent of the  relevant  Borrower,  other than (a) to the  Agent's or such
Lender's   officers,   directors,   employees,   agents  and  advisors  and,  as
contemplated  by  Section  9.07(f),  to  actual  or  prospective  assignees  and
participants,  and  then  only  on a  need-to-know  and  confidential  basis  in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) pursuant to
subpoena or other legal process or as otherwise  required by law (provided  that
the Person making such disclosure shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide
the Company with notice thereof), and (c) as requested or required by any state,
federal or foreign  authority  or examiner  regulating  banks or banking  having
jurisdiction over any Lender.

                  SECTION 9.10. Governing Law.  This Agreement and the Notes
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York.

                  SECTION 9.11. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed  in any  number of  counterparts  and by  different  parties  hereto in
separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original  and all of which  taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
agreement.  Delivery of an  executed  counterpart  of a  signature  page to this
Agreement by  telecopier  shall be effective as delivery of a manually  executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.12. Jurisdiction, Etc.(a) Each of the parties hereto
hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally  submits to the exclusive  jurisdiction
only of any New York  State  court or  federal  court of the  United  States  of
America sitting in New York City, and any appellate  court from any thereof,  in
any action or  proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement  or the
Notes,  or for  recognition  or  enforcement  of any  judgment,  and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any
such New York State court or, to the extent  permitted  by law, in such  federal
court. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each of the parties hereto agrees
that a final  judgment in any such action or proceeding  shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Each Designated  Subsidiary that has its principal place
of business  outside of the United States of America  hereby agrees that service
of process in any such action or proceeding  may be made upon the Company at its
offices specified in Section 9.02 (the "Process Agent") and each such Designated
Subsidiary hereby irrevocably appoints the Process Agent its authorized agent to
accept such service of process, and agrees that the failure of the Process Agent
to give any notice of any such  service  shall not impair or affect the validity
of such service or of any judgment  rendered in any action or  proceeding  based
thereon.  Each Borrower  hereby further  irrevocably  consents to the service of
process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any
parties  hereto by  registered  or  certified  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to such
Borrower  at its address set forth in Section  9.02.  Nothing in this  Agreement
shall affect any right that any party may otherwise  have to serve legal process
in any  other  manner  permitted  by law.  To the  extent  that  any  Designated
Subsidiary  has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from  jurisdiction  of any
court or from any legal process (whether  through service or notice,  attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,  execution or otherwise) with
respect to itself or its property, such Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably
waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement.

                  (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the Notes
in any New York State or federal court of the United  States of America  sitting
in New York City. Each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives, to the
fullest  extent  permitted by law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                    SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL
                                 OF THE COMPANY



                                                          [Effective Date]



To each of the Lenders party
  to the Credit Agreement referred
  to below and to Citibank, N.A., as
  Agent for such Lenders

                            Hershey Foods Corporation


Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section
3.01(g)(iv) of the Amended and Restated 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of
November 27, 2001 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Hershey Foods Corporation (the
"Company"), the Lenders party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent
(the "Agent") for said Lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Banc America Securities LLC, as joint lead
arrangers and joint book managers. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are
used herein as therein defined.

                  I am the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the
Company, and I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

                  In that connection, I have examined:

                  (1)      the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes
              of the Company;

                  (2)      the documents furnished by the Company pursuant to
              Article III of the Credit Agreement;

                  (3)      the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
              of the Company and all amendments thereto (the "Charter"); and

                  (4)      the by-laws of the Company and all amendments thereto
              (the "By-laws").

                  I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my
satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of
public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and
other documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. In making such examinations, I have assumed the

<PAGE>
genuineness of all signatures  (other than those on behalf of the Company),  the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to
authentic  original  documents of all  documents  submitted to me as  certified,
conformed or  photographic  copies.  As to  questions  of fact  material to such
opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently  established by me,
relied upon  certificates of the Company or its officers or of public  officials
and as to questions of fact and law, on opinions or  statements by other lawyers
reporting to me. I have assumed the due execution and delivery,  pursuant to due
authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders and the Agent.

                  My opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, where applicable, the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States.

                  Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have
deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:


                  1.       The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

                  2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
         the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company's corporate
         powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
         and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Company (including, without
         limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
         Reserve System) or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding
         on or affecting the Company or, to the best of my knowledge, contained
         in any other similar document, except where such contravention would
         not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Credit
         Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Company have been duly
         executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.

                  3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery
         and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes,
         or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
         except for the authorizations, approvals, actions, notices and filings
         (i) listed on Schedule 4.01(c) to the Credit Agreement, all of which
         have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and are in full force and
         effect and (ii) where the Company's failure to receive, take or make
         such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing would not have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  4. There (i) are no pending or, to the best of my knowledge,
         threatened actions, investigations, litigations or proceedings against
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental
         agency or arbitrator that (a) would be reasonably likely to have a
         Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Litigation) or (b)
         purport to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or
         enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated

<PAGE>
          thereby,  and (ii) there has been no adverse change in the status,  or
          financial effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
          of the Disclosed  Litigation  from that described on Schedule  3.01(b)
          thereto.

                  This opinion letter may be relied upon by you only in
connection with the transaction being consummated pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person for any other
purpose.

                                                 Very truly yours,

                           TO A DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARY


                                                                       [Date]


To each of the Lenders party
     to the Credit Agreement
     referred to below,
     and to Citibank, N.A., as Agent
     for said Lenders


Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  In my capacity as counsel to _____________________
("Designated Subsidiary"), I have reviewed that certain Amended and Restated
364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of November 27, 2001 (the "Credit
Agreement"), among Hershey Foods Corporation (the "Company"), the Lenders party
thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Agent") for said Lenders
Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and
Banc America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers.
Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined. In
connection therewith, I have also examined the following documents:

                  (i)      The Designation Letter (as defined in the Credit
                Agreement) executed by the Designated Subsidiary.

                  [such other documents as counsel may wish to refer to]

                  I have also reviewed such matters of law and examined the
original, certified, conformed or photographic copies of such other documents,
records, agreements and certificates as I have considered relevant hereto. As to
questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were
not independently established by us, relied upon certificates of the Designated
Subsidiary or of its officers or of public officials and as to questions of fact
and law, on opinions or statements by other lawyers reporting to me. I have
assumed (i) the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of
each of the documents referred to above by all parties thereto other than the
Designated Subsidiary, (ii) the authenticity of all such documents submitted to
us as originals and (iii) the conformity to originals of all such documents
submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies.

                  My opinions expressed below are limited to ________________
and the State of New York.

                  Based upon the foregoing, and upon such investigation as I
have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:

<PAGE>

                  1. The Designated Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly
         incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
         _________________________, (b) is duly qualified in each other
         jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property or in which the
         conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be licensed and
         (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and
         operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted
         and as proposed to be conducted.

                  2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Designated
         Subsidiary of its Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement and its
         Revolving Credit Notes, and the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated thereby, are within the Designated Subsidiary's corporate
         powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
         and do not contravene (i) any provision of the charter or by-laws or
         other constituent documents of the Designated Subsidiary, (ii) any law,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Designated Subsidiary or (iii) any
         contractual or legal obligation or restriction binding on or affecting
         the Designated Subsidiary, except where such contravention would not be
         reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Designation
         Letter and each Revolving Credit Note of the Designated Subsidiary has
         been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Designated
         Subsidiary.

                  3. The Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary, the
         Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Designated
         Subsidiary are, and each other Note of the Designated Subsidiary when
         executed and delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, legal, valid
         and binding obligations of the Designated Subsidiary enforceable in
         accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability
         thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
         moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally or by the application of general principles
         of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
         proceeding in equity or at law), and except that I express no opinion
         as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Courts of the
         United States of America to adjudicate any controversy relating to the
         Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary
         or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary or (ii) the effect of the law
         of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) wherein any
         Lender or Applicable Lending Office may be located or wherein
         enforcement of the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the
         Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary may be
         sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected
         by such Lender.

                  4. There is no pending, or to the best of my knowledge,
         threatened action, investigation, litigation or proceeding at law or in
         equity against the Designated Subsidiary before any court, governmental
         agency or arbitrator that would be reasonably likely to have a Material
         Adverse Effect or that purports to affect the legality, validity,
         binding effect or enforceability of the Designation Letter of the
         Designated Subsidiary, the Credit Agreement or any Revolving Credit
         Note of the Designated Subsidiary, or the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby.

                  5. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required

<PAGE>
         for the due execution, delivery
         and performance by the Designated Subsidiary of its Designation Letter,
         the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary except
         for such authorizations, consents, approvals, actions, notices or
         filings as have heretofore been made, obtained or affected and are in
         full force and effect.

                  This opinion letter may be relied upon by you only in
connection with the transaction being consummated pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person for any other
purpose.

                                                     Very truly yours,

                        AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES

                SECTION 2.01 The Revolving Credit Advances. Each Lender
severally  agrees,  on the terms and conditions  hereinafter  set forth, to make
Revolving  Credit Advances to any Borrower from time to time on any Business Day
during the period  from the  Effective  Date  until the  Termination  Date in an
aggregate amount for all Borrowers not to exceed at any time outstanding (a) the
amount set forth  opposite such  Lender's name on the signature  pages hereof or
(b) if such  Lender  has become a Lender  hereunder  pursuant  to an  Assumption
Agreement or has increased its  Commitment  pursuant to Section  2.05(c),  or if
such Lender has entered into any Assignment and Acceptance, the amount set forth
for such  Lender in the  Register  maintained  by the Agent  pursuant to Section

offered to be made by the  Lenders and  accepted by such  Borrower in respect of
such Competitive Bid Borrowing, if such Competitive Bid Borrowing is made on the
same date and by the same Borrower as such Revolving Credit Borrowing) and shall
consist of  Revolving  Credit  Advances of the same Type made on the same day by
the Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments. Within the limits
of each  Lender's  Commitment,  any Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01,
prepay pursuant to Section 2.10 and reborrow under this Section 2.01.

                SECTION 2.02 Making the Revolving Credit Advances. (a) Each
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall be made on notice,  given not later than (i)
11:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the third  Business Day prior to the date of
the  proposed  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  in the case of a  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing  consisting of  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or (ii) 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the day of the proposed  Revolving Credit Borrowing in the case of
a Revolving Credit Borrowing  consisting of Base Rate Advances,  by any Borrower
to the  Agent,  which  shall  give to  each  Lender  prompt  notice  thereof  by
telecopier or telex. Each such notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing (a "Notice
of Revolving Credit Borrowing") shall be by telephone,  confirmed immediately in
writing, or telecopier or telex in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto,
specifying  therein the requested (w) date of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,
(x) Type of Advances  comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing,  (y) aggregate
amount of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,  and (z) in the case of a Revolving
Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest Period
for each such Revolving  Credit  Advance.  Each Lender shall,  before (i) in the
case of a Eurodollar  Rate  Advance,  11:00 A.M. (New York City time) or (ii) in
the case of a Base Rate  Advance,  1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of
such  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,  make  available  for  the  account  of  its
Applicable  Lending  Office to the  Agent at the  Agent's  Account,  in same day
funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit  Borrowing.  After
the  Agent's  receipt  of such  funds  and upon  fulfillment  of the  applicable
conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to
the Borrower  requesting the Revolving  Credit  Borrowing at the Agent's address
referred to in Section 9.02.

                (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, a Borrower
may not select  Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Revolving  Credit  Borrowing if
the  obligation of the Lenders to make  Eurodollar  Rate Advances  shall then be
suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12.

                (c) Each Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing of any Borrower
shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower.  In the case of any Revolving
Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies
is to be comprised of Eurodollar  Rate Advances,  the Borrower  requesting  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall  indemnify  each Lender,  after receipt of a
written request by such Lender setting forth in reasonable  detail the basis for
such request, against any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by such Lender
as a result of any  failure  by such  Borrower  to fulfill on or before the date
specified in such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing for such Revolving Credit
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without
limitation,  any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits),  cost or


                                       15
<PAGE>


expense  actually  incurred  by reason of the  liquidation  or  reemployment  of
deposits or other funds  acquired  by such Lender to fund the  Revolving  Credit
Advance to be made by such  Lender as part of such  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing
when such Revolving Credit Advance,  as a result of such failure, is not made on
such date.

                (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate
Advances  or prior to the time of the  proposed  disbursement  of any  Revolving
Credit Borrowing  comprised of Base Rate Advances that such Lender will not make
available to the Agent such Lender's  ratable  portion of such Revolving  Credit
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Agent on the date of such Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in accordance with
subsection  (a) of this  Section  2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance  upon such
assumption,  make available to the Borrower  requesting  such  Revolving  Credit
Borrowing on such date a  corresponding  amount.  If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion  available to the Agent, such
Lender and such  Borrower  severally  agree to repay to the Agent  forthwith  on
demand such  corresponding  amount together with interest thereon,  for each day
from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest
rate  applicable  at the  time to  Revolving  Credit  Advances  comprising  such
Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of such  Lender,  the Federal
Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such  corresponding  amount,
such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as
part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit
Advance to be made by it as part of any  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  shall not
relieve  any  other  Lender of its  obligation,  if any,  hereunder  to make its
Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing,  but no
Lender  shall be  responsible  for the  failure of any other  Lender to make the
Revolving  Credit  Advance  to be made by such  other  Lender on the date of any
Revolving Credit Borrowing.

                SECTION 2.03 The Competitive Bid Advances. (a) Each Lender
severally  agrees that any Borrower may make  Competitive  Bid Borrowings  under
this  Section  2.03 from time to time on any Business Day during the period from
the date hereof until the date occurring 30 days prior to the  Termination  Date
in the manner  set forth  below;  provided  that,  following  the making of each
Competitive Bid Borrowing, the aggregate amount of the Advances then outstanding
shall  not  exceed  the  aggregate  amount  of the  Commitments  of the  Lenders
(computed without regard to any Competitive Bid Reduction).

                (i) A Borrower may request a Competitive Bid Borrowing under
this Section 2.03 by delivering to the Agent,  by telecopier or telex,  a notice
of a Competitive  Bid Borrowing (a "Notice of Competitive  Bid  Borrowing"),  in
substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto,  specifying  therein the requested
(u) date of such proposed  Competitive  Bid Borrowing,  (v) aggregate  amount of
such proposed  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  (w) interest rate basis (LIBO Rate or
fixed rate) to be offered by the Lenders,


                                       16
<PAGE>


                (x) in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of
LIBO Rate Advances,  Interest Period of each  Competitive Bid Advance to be made
as part of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  or in the case of a Competitive Bid
Borrowing Consisting of Fixed Rate Advances, maturity date for repayment of each
Fixed Rate Advance to be made as part of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing  (which
maturity  date may not be earlier than the date  occurring 7 days after the date
of such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  or later than the  earlier of (I) 180 days
after the date of such Competitive Bid Borrowing and (II) the Termination Date),
(y) interest  payment date or dates  relating  thereto,  and (z) other terms (if
any) to be applicable to such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing,  not later than 10:00
A.M. (New York City time) (A) at least one Business Day prior to the date of the
proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, if such Borrower shall specify in the Notice
of  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  that the rates of interest to be offered by the
Lenders  shall be fixed  rates  per  annum  (the  Advances  comprising  any such
Competitive Bid Borrowing being referred to herein as "Fixed Rate Advances") and
(B) at least four  Business  Days prior to the date of the proposed  Competitive
Bid  Borrowing,  if  such  Borrower  shall  instead  specify  in the  Notice  of
Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  that the rates of  interest  to be  offered  by the
Lenders  are  to be  based  on the  LIBO  Rate  (the  Advances  comprising  such
Competitive  Bid Borrowing  being  referred to herein as "LIBO Rate  Advances").
Each Notice of Competitive  Bid Borrowing of a Borrower shall be irrevocable and
binding  on  such  Borrower.  Any  Notice  of  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  by a
Designated  Subsidiary  shall  be  given to the  Agent  in  accordance  with the
preceding sentence through the Company on behalf of such Designated  Subsidiary.
The Agent  shall in turn  promptly  notify  each  Lender of each  request  for a
Competitive Bid Borrowing  received by it from a Borrower by sending such Lender
a copy of the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                (ii) Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to
do so,  irrevocably  offer to make one or more  Competitive  Bid Advances to the
Borrower  proposing  the  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  as part of such  proposed
Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  at a rate or rates of  interest  specified  by such
Lender in its sole  discretion,  by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt
notice thereof to such  Borrower),  before 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the
date of such proposed  Competitive  Bid Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive
Bid Borrowing  consisting of Fixed Rate Advances and before 10:00 A.M. (New York
City time) three Business Days before the date of such proposed  Competitive Bid
Borrowing,  in the case of a Competitive  Bid Borrowing  consisting of LIBO Rate
Advances,  of the minimum  amount and  maximum  amount of each  Competitive  Bid
Advance  which such  Lender  would be  willing to make as part of such  proposed
Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  (which  amounts may,  subject to the proviso to the
first  sentence of this Section  2.03(a),  exceed such Lender's  Commitment,  if
any),  the rate or rates  of  interest  therefor  and such  Lender's  Applicable
Lending Office with respect to such  Competitive  Bid Advance;  provided that if
the Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall,  in its sole  discretion,  elect to
make any such offer,  it shall  notify  such  Borrower of such offer at least 30
minutes  before the time and on the date on which notice of such  election is to
be given to the Agent by the other  Lenders.  If any Lender  shall  elect not to
make such an offer,  such Lender  shall so notify the Agent,  before  10:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on the date on which notice of such election is to be given
to the Agent by the other  Lenders,  and such Lender shall not be obligated  to,
and


                                       17
<PAGE>


shall not,  make any  Competitive  Bid Advance as part of such  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing; provided that the failure by any Lender to give such notice shall not
cause such Lender to be obligated to make any Competitive Bid Advance as part of
such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing.

               (iii) The Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing shall,
in turn,  before  10:30 A.M.  (New York City time) on the date of such  proposed
Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting
of Fixed Rate Advances and before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) three Business
Days before the date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing,  in the case of
a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances, either:

                    (x) cancel  such  Competitive  Bid  Borrowing  by giving the
               Agent notice to that effect, or

                    (y) accept  one or more of the offers  made by any Lender or
               Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its sole discretion,
               by giving  notice to the Agent of the amount of each  Competitive
               Bid Advance  (which  amount shall be equal to or greater than the
               minimum  amount,  and equal to or less than the  maximum  amount,
               notified  to such  Borrower by the Agent on behalf of such Lender
               for such  Competitive  Bid  Advance  pursuant to  paragraph  (ii)
               above) to be made by each Lender as part of such  Competitive Bid
               Borrowing,  and  reject  any  remaining  offers  made by  Lenders
               pursuant to  paragraph  (ii) above by giving the Agent  notice to
               that effect;  provided,  however,  that such  Borrower  shall not
               accept  any offer in excess of the  requested  bid amount for any
               maturity.  Such  Borrower  shall  accept the  offers  made by any
               Lender or Lenders to make  Competitive  Bid  Advances in order of
               the  lowest to the  highest  rates of  interest  offered  by such
               Lenders.  If two or more Lenders  have offered the same  interest
               rate,  the amount to be  borrowed at such  interest  rate will be
               allocated  among such  Lenders in  proportion  to the amount that
               each such Lender offered at such interest rate.

               (iv) If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
notifies the Agent that such Competitive Bid Borrowing is cancelled  pursuant to
paragraph  (iii)(x)  above,  the Agent shall give prompt  notice  thereof to the
Lenders and such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be made.

               (v) If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance accepts
one or more of the offers made by any Lender or Lenders  pursuant  to  paragraph
(iii)(y) above, the Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each Lender that has
made an offer as described in paragraph  (ii) above,  of the date and  aggregate
amount of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing and whether or not any offer or offers
made by such Lender  pursuant to paragraph (ii) above have been accepted by such
Borrower,  (B) each Lender that is to make a Competitive  Bid Advance as part of
such Competitive Bid Borrowing, of the amount of each Competitive Bid Advance to
be made by such Lender as part of such  Competitive Bid Borrowing,  and (C) each
Lender that is to make a Competitive Bid


                                       18
<PAGE>


Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing,  upon receipt, that the Agent
has received forms of documents  appearing to fulfill the applicable  conditions
set forth in Article III. Each Lender that is to make a Competitive  Bid Advance
as part of such  Competitive  Bid Borrowing  shall,  before 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) on the date of such Competitive Bid Borrowing specified in the notice
received from the Agent pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding  sentence or any
later time when such Lender shall have received  notice from the Agent  pursuant
to clause (C) of the preceding  sentence,  make available for the account of its
Applicable  Lending  Office to the  Agent at the  Agent's  Account,  in same day
funds, such Lender's portion of such Competitive Bid Borrowing. Upon fulfillment
of the  applicable  conditions set forth in Article III and after receipt by the
Agent of such funds,  the Agent will make such funds  available to such Borrower
at the  Agent's  address  referred  to in  Section  9.02.  Promptly  after  each
Competitive Bid Borrowing the Agent will notify each Lender of the amount of the
Competitive  Bid  Borrowing,  the consequent  Competitive  Bid Reduction and the
dates upon which such Competitive Bid Reduction commenced and will terminate.

                (vi) If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance
notifies  the Agent that it accepts one or more of the offers made by any Lender
or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above, such notice of acceptance shall
be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower.  Such Borrower shall indemnify each
Lender,  after  receipt of a written  request by such  Lender  setting  forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such request,  against any loss, cost or expense
actually  incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by such Borrower to
fulfill on or before the date specified in the related Notice of Competitive Bid
Borrowing for such Competitive Bid Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth
in Article  III,  including,  without  limitation,  any loss (other than loss of
anticipated  profits),  cost or  expense  actually  incurred  by  reason  of the
liquidation or  reemployment  of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender
to fund the  Competitive  Bid  Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such
Competitive Bid Borrowing when such Competitive Bid Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.

                (b) Each Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
amount of  $10,000,000  or an integral  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof
and,  following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing,  the Borrower that
has borrowed  through such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in compliance with
the  limitation set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of subsection (a)
above.

Section  2.03,  each  Borrower  may from time to time borrow  under this Section
2.03,  repay or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this
Section 2.03.

(d) Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall
repay to the Agent for the account of each Lender that has made a Competitive
Bid Advance, on the maturity date of such Competitive Bid Advance (such maturity
date being that specified by such Borrower for repayment of such Competitive Bid
Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to
subsection (a)(i) above and provided in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such


                                       19

Competitive Bid Advance),  the then unpaid  principal amount of such Competitive
Bid Advance.  A Borrower  shall have no right to prepay any principal  amount of
any Competitive Bid Advance without the consent of the Lender that has made such
Competitive  Bid Advance or as is  specified  in the Notice of  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing.

                (e) Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid
Borrowing shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal amount of each Competitive
Bid  Advance  from the date of such  Competitive  Bid  Advance  comprising  such
Competitive Bid Borrowing to the date the principal  amount of such  Competitive
Bid Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such  Competitive Bid
Advance  specified  by the Lender  making  such  Competitive  Bid Advance in its
notice with respect  thereto  delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(ii)  above,
payable on the  interest  payment date or dates  specified by such  Borrower for
such  Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing
delivered  pursuant to subsection  (a)(i) above,  as provided in the Competitive

Competitive  Bid Advance under the terms of the  Competitive Bid Note evidencing
such  Competitive Bid Advance unless  otherwise  agreed in such  Competitive Bid
Note.

                (f) The indebtedness of any Borrower resulting from each
Competitive  Bid  Advance  made to such  Borrower as part of a  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing shall be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of such Borrower
payable to the order of the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.

                SECTION 2.04 Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay
to the Agent for the  account  of each  Lender a facility  fee on the  aggregate
amount  of such  Lender's  Commitment  from the date  hereof in the case of each
Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement
or the  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  as the case may be,  pursuant  to which it
became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at a
rate per annum equal to the  Applicable  Percentage in effect from time to time,
payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June,  September and
December, commencing March 31, 2002, and on the Termination Date.

                (b) Agent's Fees.  The Company shall pay to the Agent for its

respective Commitments of the Lenders,


                                       20
<PAGE>


provided  that  each  partial  reduction  shall be in the  aggregate  amount  of
$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and provided
further that the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be
reduced to an amount  that is less than the  aggregate  principal  amount of the
Competitive  Bid  Advances  then  outstanding.   The  aggregate  amount  of  the
Commitments, once reduced or terminated as provided in this Section 2.05(a), may
not be reinstated, except as provided in Section 2.05(c) below.

                (b) Termination by the Majority Lenders upon Change of Control.

request,  or may with the  consent,  of the Majority  Lenders,  by notice to the
Company  given not later than 10 Business  Days after receipt by the Lenders and
the Agent of notice  from the  Company  of such  Change of Control  pursuant  to
Section 5.01(h)(iv),  declare the Commitments  (determined without giving effect
to any Competitive Bid Reduction) to be terminated in whole, effective as of the
date set forth in such  notice,  provided,  however,  that such date shall be no
earlier  than 10  Business  Days after the  Company's  receipt of such notice of
termination  and (ii)  each  Borrower's  right to make a  Borrowing  under  this
Agreement  shall  thereupon be suspended  and shall  remain  suspended  until 10
Business  Days after  receipt by the  Lenders  and the Agent of notice  from the
Company of such  Change of Control  pursuant to Section  5.01(h)(iv)  unless the
Majority  Lenders shall have exercised  their right to terminate the Commitments
as provided in clause (i) of this Section 2.05(b), in which case each Borrower's
right to make a Borrowing under this Agreement shall remain  suspended until the
effective date of such  termination.  A notice of  termination  pursuant to this
Section 2.05(b) shall have the effect of accelerating  the outstanding  Advances
of the Lenders and the Notes of the Lenders and each Borrower shall, on or prior
to the effective date of the termination of the Commitments,  prepay or cause to
be prepaid the  outstanding  principal  amount of all Advances owing by any such
Borrower to the Lenders,  together with accrued  interest thereon to the date of
such payment, any facility fees or other fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to
the  provisions  of Section 2.04,  and all other amounts  payable to the Lenders
under this  Agreement  (including,  but not limited to, any  increased  costs or
other amounts owing under Section 2.11 and any  indemnification  for Taxes under
Section 2.14).  Upon such  prepayment and the  termination of the Commitments in
accordance with this Section 2.05(b),  the obligations of the Lenders under this
Agreement shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged.

                (c) Increase by the Company. (i) The Company may at any time, by
notice to the Agent,  propose that the aggregate  amount of the  Commitments  be
increased (each such proposed  increase being a "Commitment  Increase") by up to
$300,000,000  in excess of the aggregate of the  Commitments as of the Effective
Date,  effective  as at a date (the  "Commitment  Increase  Date") that shall be
specified in such notice and that shall be (A) prior to the Termination Date and
(B) at least 15 Business Days after the date of such notice; provided,  however,
that (w) the Company may not propose more than one  Commitment  Increase  during
any  calendar  year,  (x) the  minimum  proposed  Commitment  Increase  for each
Commitment  Increase  Date  shall  be  $50,000,000,  (y) in no event  shall  the
aggregate  amount of the Commitments at any time exceed  $500,000,000 and (z) no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such  Commitment  Increase Date
or


                                       21
<PAGE>


shall result from such Commitment  Increase.  The Agent shall notify the Lenders
and any Eligible Assignees  requested by the Company and acceptable to the Agent
as potential  Assuming  Lenders  hereunder of the proposed  Commitment  Increase
promptly  upon  the  Agent's  receipt  of any such  notice.  It shall be in each
Lender's  sole  discretion  whether to  increase  its  Commitment  hereunder  in
connection with the proposed Commitment Increase. No later than 10 Business Days
after its  receipt  of the  Company's  notice,  each  Lender  that is willing to
increase  its  Commitment  hereunder  (each  such  Lender  being an  "Increasing
Lender")  shall  deliver  to the Agent a notice in which such  Lender  shall set
forth the maximum  increase in its Commitment to which such Lender is willing to
agree,  and the  Agent  shall  promptly  provide  to the  Company a copy of such
Increasing  Lender's  notice.  The Agent  shall  cooperate  with the  Company in
discussions with the Lenders and Eligible Assignees with a view to arranging the
proposed  Commitment  Increase through the increase of the Commitments of one or
more of the  Lenders  and/or  the  addition  of one or more  Eligible  Assignees
acceptable  to the Company  and the Agent as Assuming  Lenders and as parties to
this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the minimum  Commitment of each such
Assuming Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement  pursuant to this Section
2.05(c) shall be  $10,000,000;  and provided,  further,  that any allocations of
Commitments shall be determined by the Company.

                (ii) If agreement is reached prior to the relevant Commitment
Increase  Date  with  any  Increasing  Lenders  and  Assuming  Lenders  as  to a
Commitment  Increase  (the  amount  of which may be less  than  (subject  to the
limitation  set forth in clause (i)(x) of this Section  2.05(c)) but not greater
than that amount  specified  in the  applicable  notice from the  Company),  the
Company shall  deliver,  no later than one Business Day prior to the  Commitment
Increase Date, a notice thereof in reasonable detail to the Agent (and the Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Lenders,  including any Assuming Lenders).  The
Assuming  Lenders,  if any, shall become Lenders  hereunder as of the Commitment
Increase Date and the  Commitments of any  Increasing  Lenders and such Assuming
Lenders  shall become or be, as the case may be, as of the  Commitment  Increase
Date, the amounts specified in the notice delivered by the Company to the Agent;
provided, however, that:

                  (x) the Agent shall have received on or prior to 9:00 A.M.
         (New York City time) on the Commitment Increase Date (A) a duly
         executed Revolving Credit Note from each Borrower, dated as of the
         Commitment Increase Date and in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1
         hereto for each Assuming Lender, and dated the date to which interest
         on the existing Revolving Credit Note of such Borrower shall have been
         paid and in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto for each
         Increasing Lender, in each case in an amount equal to the Commitment of
         each such Assuming Lender and each such Increasing Lender after giving
         effect to such Commitment Increase, (B) a certificate of a duly
         authorized officer of the Company stating that no event has occurred
         and is continuing, or would result from such Commitment Increase, that
         constitutes a Default, and that each of the other applicable conditions
         to such Commitment Increase set forth in this Section 2.05(c) to be
         fulfilled by the Company has been satisfied and (C) an opinion of
         counsel for the Company in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto,



                                       22
<PAGE>


         dated the Commitment Increase Date (with copies for each Lender,
         including each Assuming Lender);

                  (y) with respect to each Assuming Lender, the Agent shall have
         received, on or prior to 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
         Commitment Increase Date, an appropriate Assumption Agreement in
         substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, duly executed by such
         Assuming Lender and the Company, and acknowledged by the Agent; and

                  (z) each Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Agent,
         on or prior to 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment
         Increase Date, (A) its existing Revolving Credit Note or Notes and (B)
         confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased
         Commitment, with a copy of such confirmation to the Company.

                (iii) Upon its receipt of confirmation from a Lender that it is
increasing its Commitment  hereunder,  together with the  appropriate  Revolving
Credit  Note or Notes,  certificate  and opinion  referred to in clause  (ii)(x)
above,  the Agent  shall (A) record  the  information  contained  therein in the
Register and (B) give prompt notice thereof to the Company.  Upon its receipt of
an Assumption  Agreement executed by an Assuming Lender  representing that it is
an Eligible  Assignee,  together with the appropriate  Revolving  Credit Note or
Notes,  certificate and opinion  referred to in clause (ii)(x) above,  the Agent
shall, if such Assumption  Agreement has been completed and is in  substantially
the form of Exhibit D hereto, (x) accept such Assumption  Agreement,  (y) record
the  information  contained  therein in the Register and (z) give prompt  notice
thereof to the Company.

                (iv) In the event that the Agent shall not have received notice
from the Company as to such  agreement  on or prior to the  Commitment  Increase
Date or the  Company  shall,  by  notice to the  Agent  prior to the  Commitment
Increase  Date,  withdraw its  proposal for a Commitment  Increase or any of the
actions  provided for above in clauses  (ii)(x)  through  (ii)(z) shall not have
occurred by 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment Increase Date, such
proposal  by the Company  shall be deemed not to have been made.  In such event,
any actions  theretofore taken under clauses (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) above shall
be deemed to be of no effect and all the rights and  obligations  of the parties
shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.

                (v) In the event that the Agent shall have received notice from
the Company as to such agreement on or prior to the Commitment Increase Date and
each of the actions  provided for in clauses (ii)(x) through (ii)(z) above shall
have occurred by 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Commitment Increase Date,
the Agent  shall  notify the Lenders  (including  any  Assuming  Lenders) of the
occurrence  of the  Commitment  Increase Date promptly and in any event by 10:00
A.M.  (New York  City  time) on such date by  telecopier,  telex or cable.  Each
Increasing  Lender and each Assuming  Lender shall,  before 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the Commitment  Increase  Date,  make available for the account of
its Applicable  Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's Account,  in same day
funds, in the case of such Assuming Lender,


                                       23
<PAGE>


an amount  equal to such  Assuming  Lender's  ratable  portion of the  Revolving
Credit  Borrowings  then  outstanding  (calculated  based on its Commitment as a
percentage of the aggregate  Commitments  outstanding after giving effect to the
relevant  Commitment  Increase) and, in the case of such Increasing  Lender,  an
amount equal to the excess of (i) such  Increasing  Lender's  ratable portion of
the  Revolving  Credit  Borrowings  then  outstanding  (calculated  based on its
Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving
effect to the relevant  Commitment  Increase) over (ii) such Increasing Lender's
ratable portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding  (calculated
based on its  Commitment  (without  giving  effect  to the  relevant  Commitment
Increase) as a percentage of the aggregate  Commitments without giving effect to
the relevant Commitment Increase).  After the Agent's receipt of such funds from
each such  Increasing  Lender  and each such  Assuming  Lender,  the Agent  will
promptly  thereafter cause to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for
the account of their respective  Applicable Lending Offices in an amount to each
other Lender such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding  Revolving Credit
Advances  owing to each Lender after giving effect to such  distribution  equals
such  Lender's  ratable  portion  of  the  Revolving   Credit   Borrowings  then
outstanding (calculated based on such Lender's Commitment as a percentage of the
aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment
Increase). If the Commitment Increase Date shall occur on a date that is not the
last  day  of  the  Interest  Period  for  all  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  then
outstanding,  (a) the Company  shall pay any amounts  owing  pursuant to Section
9.04(d)  as a  result  of  the  distributions  to  Lenders  under  this  Section
2.05(c)(v) and (b) for each Revolving Credit  Borrowing  comprised of Eurodollar
Rate Advances,  the respective  Revolving Credit Advances made by the Increasing
Lenders and the Assuming  Lenders  pursuant to this Section  2.05(c)(v) shall be
Base Rate Advances until the last day of the then existing  Interest  Period for
such Revolving Credit Borrowing.

                SECTION 2.06 Repayment of Revolving Credit Advances. Each
Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable  account of the Lenders on the
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances
then outstanding in respect of such Borrower.

                SECTION 2.07 Interest on Revolving Credit Advances. (a)
Scheduled  Interest.  Each Borrower  shall pay interest on the unpaid  principal
amount of each  Revolving  Credit  Advance owing by such Borrower to each Lender
from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount shall
be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

                (i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Revolving
Credit  Advance is a Base Rate  Advance,  a rate per annum equal at all times to
the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the Applicable
Margin in effect from time to time plus (z) the Applicable  Utilization  Fee, if
any, in effect from time to time,  payable in arrears  quarterly on the last day
of each March, June,  September and December during such periods and on the date
such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.


                                       24
<PAGE>


                (ii) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such
Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at
all times during each Interest  Period for such Revolving  Credit Advance to the
sum of (x) the  Eurodollar  Rate for such  Interest  Period  for such  Revolving
Credit Advance plus (y) the  Applicable  Margin in effect from time to time plus
(z) the Applicable Utilization Fee, if any, in effect from time to time, payable
in arrears on the last day of such Interest  Period and, if such Interest Period
has a duration of more than three  months,  on each day that occurs  during such
Interest  Period every three months from the first day of such  Interest  Period
and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance  of an Event of Default under Section  6.01(a),  each Borrower shall
pay interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance
owing by such Borrower to each Lender,  payable in arrears on the dates referred
to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above,  at a rate per annum equal at all times to
2% per  annum  above the rate per annum  required  to be paid on such  Revolving
Credit  Advance  pursuant  to  clause  (a)(i) or  (a)(ii)  above and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount
payable hereunder by such Borrower that is not paid when due, from the date such
amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full,  payable in arrears
on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum
equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum  required to be paid
on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above.

                (c) Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances. The
applicable  Borrower  shall pay to each Lender,  so long as such Lender shall be
required  under  regulations  of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve
System to maintain  reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of
or  including  Eurocurrency  Liabilities,  additional  interest  on  the  unpaid
principal  amount  of  each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance  of such  Lender  to such
Borrower,  from the date of such Advance until such principal  amount is paid in
full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained
by subtracting  (i) the Eurodollar  Rate for the applicable  Interest Period for
such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such  Eurodollar  Rate by a
percentage  equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar  Rate Reserve  Percentage of such
Lender  for such  Interest  Period,  payable on each date on which  interest  is
payable on such Advance.  Such  additional  interest shall be determined by such
Lender and notified in reasonable detail to such Borrower through the Agent.

                SECTION 2.08 Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference
Bank  agrees to  furnish  to the Agent  timely  information  for the  purpose of
determining  each  Eurodollar Rate and each LIBO Rate. If any one or more of the
Reference  Banks shall not furnish such timely  information to the Agent for the
purpose of determining  any such interest  rate, the Agent shall  determine such
interest  rate on the basis of timely  information  furnished  by the  remaining
Reference  Banks.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the relevant  Borrowers
and the Lenders of the  applicable  interest  rate  determined  by the Agent for
purposes of Section  2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by each
Reference  Bank for the purpose of  determining  the interest rate under Section
2.07(a)(ii).


                                       25
<PAGE>


                (b) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
Majority  Lenders  notify the Agent that the  Eurodollar  Rate for any  Interest
Period for such Advances will not  adequately  reflect the cost to such Majority
Lenders of making,  funding or  maintaining  their  respective  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances  for such  Interest  Period  (which  cost each such  Lender  reasonably
determines in good faith is material),  the Agent shall forthwith so notify each
Borrower  and the  Lenders,  whereupon  (i) each  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance will
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert  into a Base Rate  Advance,  and (ii) the  obligation  of the Lenders to
make, or to Convert  Revolving  Credit  Advances into,  Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders
that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                (c) If any Borrower, in requesting a Revolving Credit Borrowing
comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances,  shall fail to select the duration of the
Interest  Period  for such  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  in  accordance  with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Agent will  forthwith so notify such  Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances
will  automatically,  on the  last  day of the  then  existing  Interest  Period
therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                (d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of  Eurodollar  Rate Advances  comprising  any  Borrowing  shall be reduced,  by
payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event
of Default, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day
of the then existing Interest Period therefor,  Convert into a Base Rate Advance
and (ii) the  obligation  of the Lenders to make, or to Convert  Advances  into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

                (f) If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information
to the Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate or LIBO Rate for any Eurodollar
Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may be, such Eurodollar Rate or
LIBO Rate shall be the interest rate per annum determined by the Agent to be the
offered  rate  per  annum at  which  deposits  in U.S.  dollars  for a  maturity
comparable to the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate
Advances,  as the  case  may be,  appears  on the  Telerate  Page  3750  (or any
successor  page) as of 11:00 A.M.  (London  time) two Business Days prior to the
first  day of  such  Interest  Period  (the  "Telerate");  provided  that if the
Telerate is not then available:

                (i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the relevant Borrower and
the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurodollar Rate
Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may be;

                (ii) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Advances, each such Advance
will  automatically,  on the  last  day of the  then  existing  Interest  Period
therefor, Convert into a


                                       26
<PAGE>


Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue
as a Base Rate Advance); and

                (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or LIBO Rate  Advances or to Convert  Revolving  Credit  Advances  into
Eurodollar  Rate Advances  shall be suspended  until the Agent shall notify each
Borrower  and the Lenders that the  circumstances  causing  such  suspension  no
longer exist.

                SECTION 2.09 Optional Conversion of Revolving Credit Advances.
Any Borrower may on any Business  Day,  upon notice given to the Agent not later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed  Conversion  and subject to the  provisions of Sections 2.08 and
2.12,  Convert all Revolving  Credit  Advances of one Type  comprising  the same
Borrowing into Revolving Credit Advances of the other Type;  provided,  however,
that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be
made  only on the last  day of an  Interest  Period  for  such  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances.  Each such  notice of a  Conversion  shall,  within  the  restrictions
specified  above,  specify (i) the date of such  Conversion,  (ii) the Revolving
Credit Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar
Rate  Advances,  the  duration  of the  initial  Interest  Period  for each such
Advance.  Each  notice of  Conversion  shall be  irrevocable  and binding on the
relevant Borrower.

                SECTION 2.10 Optional Prepayments of Revolving Credit Advances.
Any  Borrower  may,  upon  notice to the Agent  stating  the  proposed  date and
aggregate  principal  amount of the prepayment,  given not later than 11:00 A.M.
(New  York  City  time) on the  second  Business  Day  prior to the date of such
proposed prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, and not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of such proposed  prepayment,  in the
case of Base Rate  Advances,  and, if such notice is given such Borrower  shall,
prepay  the  outstanding  principal  amount  of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
comprising  part of the same Revolving  Credit  Borrowing in whole or ratably in
part,  together  with  accrued  interest to the date of such  prepayment  on the
principal amount prepaid;  provided,  however,  that (x) each partial prepayment
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance,  such  Borrower  shall be obligated to reimburse  the
Lenders  in  respect  thereof  pursuant  to  Section  9.04(d).  Each  notice  of
prepayment  by a Designated  Subsidiary  shall be given to the Agent through the
Company.

                SECTION 2.11 Increased Costs. (a) If, after the date hereof, due
to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of
imposition or increase of reserve  requirements  included in the Eurodollar Rate
Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii)
the  compliance  with any  guideline  or request  from any central bank or other
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  over any Lender  (whether  or not
having the force of law),  there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender
(which cost such Lender  reasonably  determines  in good faith is  material)  of
agreeing to make or making,  funding or maintaining  Eurodollar Rate Advances or
LIBO Rate Advances (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11 any such


                                       27
<PAGE>


increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section
2.14 shall govern) and (ii) Excluded Taxes), then the Borrower of such Advances
shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender made not later than 60 days
after such Lender obtains knowledge of such increased costs (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. Each
Lender agrees that if such Lender requests compensation for any amounts owing
from a Borrower for such increased cost under this Section 2.11(a), such Lender
shall, prior to a Borrower being required to pay such increased costs, furnish
to such Borrower a certificate of a senior financial officer of such Lender
verifying that such increased cost was actually incurred by such Lender and the
amount of such increased cost and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
therefore (with a copy of such certificate to the Agent); provided, however,
that such certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

                (b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender determines that
compliance  with any law or  regulation  or any  guideline  or request  from any
central bank or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over any Lender
(whether or not having the force of law)  affects or would  affect the amount of
capital  required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling  such Lender and that the amount of such  capital is increased by or
based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other
commitments of this type,  then,  upon demand by such Lender made not later than
60 days after such Lender obtains  knowledge of such increase in capital (with a
copy of such  demand to the Agent),  the Company  shall pay to the Agent for the
account  of  such  Lender,  from  time  to time  as  specified  by such  Lender,
additional  amounts  sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in
the light of such  circumstances,  to the  extent  that such  Lender  reasonably
determines  such  increase in capital to be allocable  to the  existence of such
Lender's  commitment to lend  hereunder.  Each Lender agrees that if such Lender
requests  compensation  for any amounts owing from the Company for such increase
in capital under this Section  2.11(b),  such Lender shall,  prior to a Borrower
being required to compensate  such Lender for such increase in capital,  furnish
to the  Company a  certificate  of a senior  financial  officer  of such  Lender
verifying that such increase in capital was actually required by such Lender and
the amount of such increase in capital and setting  forth in  reasonable  detail
the basis  therefore (with a copy of such  certificate to the Agent);  provided,
however, that such certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

                (c) No Borrower shall be obligated to pay under this Section
2.11 any amounts which relate to costs or increases of capital incurred prior to
the 12 months  immediately  preceding  the date of demand  for  payment  of such
amounts,  unless the applicable law, regulation,  guideline or request resulting
in such costs or increases of capital is imposed  retroactively.  In the case of
any law, regulation,  guideline or request which is imposed  retroactively,  the
Lender  making  demand for payment of any amount  under this  Section 2.11 shall
notify the  related  Borrower  not later than 12 months  from the date that such
Lender should reasonably have known (but promptly upon gaining knowledge of such
increase)  of such law,  regulation,  guideline  or request and such  Borrower's
obligation  to compensate  such Lender for such amount is  contingent  upon such
Lender's so notifying such Borrower; provided, however, that any failure by such


                                       28
<PAGE>


Lender to provide such notice shall not affect such Borrower's obligations under
this Section 2.11 with respect to amounts  resulting  from costs or increases of
capital incurred after the date which occurs 12 months immediately preceding the
date on which  such  Lender  notified  such  Borrower  of such law,  regulation,
guideline or request.

                (d) If any Lender shall subsequently recoup any costs (other
than from a Borrower) for which such Lender has theretofore  been compensated by
a Borrower under this Section 2.11,  such Lender shall remit to such Borrower an
amount equal to the amount of such  recoupment as reasonably  determined by such
Lender.

                SECTION 2.12 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if any Lender shall after the date hereof, notify the Agent that
the  introduction  of or any  change in or in the  interpretation  of any law or
regulation  makes  it  unlawful,  or any  central  bank  or  other  governmental
authority having  jurisdiction over any Lender asserts that it is unlawful,  for
any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder
to make  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to fund or maintain
Eurodollar  Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances  hereunder,  (i) each Eurodollar
Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance, as the case may be, will automatically,  upon
such demand,  Convert into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest
at the rate set forth in  Section  2.07(a)(i),  as the case may be, and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances
or to Convert  Revolving  Credit Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended  until the Agent shall  notify each  Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                SECTION 2.13 Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrower shall
make each  payment  hereunder  and  relating to the Advances not later than 1:00
P.M.  (New York City  time) on the day when due in U.S.  dollars to the Agent at
the Agent's Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly  thereafter cause
to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or
facility  fees ratably  (other than amounts  payable  pursuant to Section  2.03,
2.05(c), 2.07(c), 2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(d)) to the Lenders for the account of their
respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of
any other  amount  payable to any Lender to such  Lender for the  account of its
Applicable  Lending  Office,  in each case to be applied in accordance  with the
terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and
recording  of the  information  contained  therein in the  Register  pursuant to
Section 9.07(c),  from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment
and Acceptance,  the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and relating to the
Advances  in respect of the  interest  assigned  thereby to the Lender  assignee
thereunder,  and the parties to such  Assignment and  Acceptance  shall make all
appropriate  adjustments  in such payments for periods  prior to such  effective
date directly  between  themselves.  Upon any Assuming  Lender becoming a Lender
hereunder as a result of the effectiveness of a Commitment  Increase pursuant to
Section  2.05(c),  and upon the  Agent's  receipt  of such  Lender's  Assumption
Agreement and recording the information contained therein in the Register,  from
and  after  the  relevant  Increase  Date,  the Agent  shall  make all  payments
hereunder  and  relating  to the  Advances  in respect of the  interest  assumed
thereby to such Assuming Lender.

                (b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be
made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and all  computations  of interest based on the  Eurodollar  Rate or the Federal
Funds  Rate and of  facility  fees  shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a
year of 360 days,  in each case for the  actual  number of days  (including  the
first day but  excluding  the last day)  occurring  in the period for which such
interest or facility  fees are payable.  Each  determination  by the Agent of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

                (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or relating to the Advances
shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee,
as the case may be;  provided,  however,  that,  if such  extension  would cause
payment of interest on or principal  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances or LIBO Rate
Advances to be made in the next following  calendar month, such payment shall be
made on the next preceding Business Day.

                (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders from such  Borrower
hereunder  that such Borrower will not make such payment in full,  the Agent may
assume  that such  Borrower  has made such  payment in full to the Agent on such
date  and  the  Agent  may,  in  reliance  upon  such  assumption,  cause  to be
distributed  to each Lender on such due date an amount  equal to the amount then
due such Lender.  If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such
payment in full to the Agent,  each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount  distributed to such Lender  together with interest  thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is  distributed  to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                SECTION 2.14 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by each Borrower
hereunder or relating to the Advances shall be made, in accordance  with Section
2.13, free and clear of and without  deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes
imposed on its overall net income,  and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of
net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political  subdivision thereof or
by any  jurisdiction  in which such  Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is
doing  business that is unrelated to this Agreement and such net income taxes or
franchise taxes that would not have been imposed if such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) had not been  conducting  such  unrelated  business and, in the
case of each  Lender,  taxes  imposed on its overall net income,  and  franchise
taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income  taxes,  by the  jurisdiction  of such
Lender's  Applicable  Lending Office or any political  subdivision  thereof (all
such excluded taxes being  hereinafter  referred to as "Excluded  Taxes" and all
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,  charges, withholdings and
liabilities  in respect of payments  hereunder or relating to the Advances being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum


                                       30
<PAGE>


payable  hereunder or relating to the  Advances to any Lender or the Agent,  (i)
the sum payable  shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all
required  deductions for Taxes  (including  deductions  for Taxes  applicable to
additional  sums payable  under this Section  2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received had
no such  deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant  taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

                (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar  levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or relating to the
Advances or from the execution,  delivery or registration of,  performing under,
or  otherwise  with  respect to,  this  Agreement  or  relating to the  Advances
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for
the full  amount of Taxes or Other Taxes  (including,  without  limitation,  any
taxes imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable under this Section 2.14)
imposed  on or paid by such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case may be) and any
liability for penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the
date  such  Lender  or the  Agent  (as the case  may be)  makes  written  demand
therefor; provided that such Lender shall, prior to a Borrower being required to
indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14(c), furnish to such Borrower
a certificate of a senior  financial  officer of such Lender verifying that such
Taxes or Other  Taxes were  actually  incurred  by such Lender and the amount of
such  Taxes or Other  Taxes and  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail the basis
therefor (with a copy of such certificate to the Agent), provided, however, that
such  certificate  shall be  conclusive  and  binding for all  purposes,  absent
manifest error.

                (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each
Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. In the
case of any payment hereunder or relating to the Advances by or on behalf of any
Borrower  through  an account or branch  outside  the United  States or by or on
behalf of any Borrower by a payor that is not a United  States  person,  if such
Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof,  such Borrower
shall  furnish,  or shall  cause such payor to  furnish,  to the Agent,  at such
address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment
is exempt from Taxes.  For purposes of this  subsection (d) and subsection  (e),
the terms  "United  States" and "United  States  person" shall have the meanings
specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

                (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this  Agreement  in the case of each  Initial  Lender  and on the date of the
Assignment  and  Acceptance  or the  Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,
pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from
time to time  thereafter  as requested  in writing by any Borrower  (but only so
long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide


                                       31
<PAGE>


the Agent and each Borrower  with two original  Internal  Revenue  Service forms
1001 or 4224, as  appropriate,  or any successor or other form prescribed by the
Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled
to a reduced rate of United States  withholding tax on payments pursuant to this
Agreement or relating to the Advances.  If the forms provided by a Lender at the
time such  Lender  first  becomes a party to this  Agreement  indicates a United
States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero,  withholding tax at such
rate  shall be  considered  excluded  from Taxes  unless  and until such  Lender
provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies,  whereupon
withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes
for periods governed by such form;  provided,  however,  that, if at the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance or the Assumption  Agreement,  as the case may be,
pursuant  to which a Lender  assignee  becomes  a party to this  Agreement,  the
Lender  assignor was  entitled to payments  under  subsection  (a) in respect of
United States  withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then,
to such extent,  the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding  taxes
that may be imposed  in the  future or other  amounts  otherwise  includable  in
Taxes) United States  withholding  tax, if any,  applicable  with respect to the
Lender assignee on such date.

                (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to
provide each Borrower with the  appropriate  form  described in Section  2.14(e)
(other than if such failure is due to a change in law  occurring  subsequent  to
the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form
otherwise is not required  under the first  sentence of  subsection  (e) above),
such Lender shall not be entitled to  indemnification  under Section  2.14(a) or
(c) with  respect  to Taxes  imposed  by the  United  States  by  reason of such
failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because
of its failure to deliver a form required  hereunder,  each  Borrower  agrees to
take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to
recover such Taxes.

                (g) If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, deduction or credit of
any Taxes or Other Taxes paid or reimbursed by a Borrower pursuant to subjection
(a) or (c) above in respect of payments  under the Credit  Agreement or relating
to the Advances,  a current  monetary  benefit that it would  otherwise not have
obtained,  and that would result in the total  payments  under this Section 2.14
exceeding the amount needed to make such Lender whole,  such Lender shall pay to
such  Borrower,  with  reasonable  promptness  following  the  date on  which it
actually  realizes such benefit,  an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of
such  benefit or the amount of such excess,  in each case net of all  reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in securing such refund, deduction or credit.

                SECTION 2.15 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall
obtain any payment (whether voluntary,  involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off,  or  otherwise) on account of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances
owing to it (other than  pursuant to Section  2.05(c),  2.07(c),  2.11,  2.14 or
9.04(d)) in excess of its ratable  share of payments on account of the Revolving
Credit  Advances  obtained  by all the  Lenders,  such  Lender  shall  forthwith
purchase from the other  Lenders such  participations  in the  Revolving  Credit
Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing


                                       32
<PAGE>


Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however,
that if all or any portion of such excess  payment is thereafter  recovered from
such  purchasing  Lender,  such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and
such  Lender  shall repay to the  purchasing  Lender the  purchase  price to the
extent of such recovery  together with an amount equal to such Lender's  ratable
share  (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's  required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the  purchasing  Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total  amount so  recovered.  Each  Borrower  agrees  that any  Lender so
purchasing a  participation  from another  Lender  pursuant to this Section 2.15
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,  exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such  participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct  creditor of such  Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

                SECTION 2.16 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall
be available (and each Borrower  agrees that it shall use such proceeds)  solely
(i) for general  corporate  purposes of such Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  and
(ii) for  acquisitions  by such Borrower that have been approved by the Board of
Directors of the corporation that is to be acquired by such Borrower.

                SECTION 2.17 Mandatory Assignment by a Lender; Mitigation. If
any Lender  requests from a Borrower  either  payment of additional  interest on
Eurodollar  Rate Advances  pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  or  reimbursement  for
increased  costs  pursuant to Section 2.11, or payment of or  reimbursement  for
Taxes  pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender  notifies the Agent that it is
unlawful  for such  Lender  or its  Eurodollar  Lending  Office to  perform  its
obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 2.12, (i) such Lender will, upon three
Business  Days'  notice by such  Borrower to such  Lender and the Agent,  to the
extent not  inconsistent  with such Lender's  internal  policies and  applicable
legal and  regulatory  restrictions,  use  reasonable  efforts to make,  fund or
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances through another  Eurodollar Lending Office
of such Lender if (A) as a result thereof the additional  amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Section  2.07(c),  2.11 or 2.14, as  applicable,  in respect of
such Eurodollar  Rate Advances would be materially  reduced or the provisions of
Section  2.12  would  not  apply  to  such  Lender,  as  applicable,  and (B) as
determined by such Lender in good faith but in its sole  discretion,  the making
or maintaining of such  Eurodollar Rate Advances  through such other  Eurodollar
Lending  Office  would  not  otherwise  materially  and  adversely  affect  such
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  or such  Lender  and (ii)  unless  such  Lender  has
therefore taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured (to the extent
not  inconsistent  with internal  policies and  applicable  legal and regulatory
restrictions),  the conditions  creating such  obligation to pay such additional
amounts or the  circumstances  described in Section 2.12, such Lender will, upon
at least five  Business  Days'  notice  from the  Company to such Lender and the
Agent,  assign,  pursuant to and in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section
9.07, to one or more Eligible  Assignees  designated by the Company all, but not
less than all, of the  Revolving  Credit  Advances then owing to such Lender and
all, but not less than all, of such Lender's  rights and  obligations  hereunder
(other  than  rights in respect of such  Lender's  outstanding  Competitive  Bid
Advance),  without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender, for a
purchase price equal to the  outstanding  principal  amount of each such Advance
then owing to such Lender plus any


                                       33
<PAGE>


accrued but unpaid  interest  thereon and any accrued but unpaid  facility  fees
owing thereto and, in addition,  all additional  costs  reimbursements,  expense
reimbursements  and  indemnities,  if any,  owing in  respect  of such  Lender's
Commitment hereunder at such time shall be paid to such Lender.

                SECTION 2.18 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in
accordance  with its usual  practice  an  account  or  accounts  evidencing  the
indebtedness  of each  Borrower to such  Lender  resulting  from each  Revolving
Credit Advance owing to such Lender from time to time,  including the amounts of
principal  and  interest  payable  and  paid to such  Lender  from  time to time
hereunder in respect of Revolving  Credit  Advances.  Each Borrower  agrees that
upon  reasonable  notice  by any  Lender to such  Borrower  (with a copy of such
notice to the Agent) to the effect that a  Revolving  Credit Note is required or
appropriate  in order for such  Lender to  evidence  (whether  for  purposes  of
pledge,  enforcement or otherwise) the Revolving Credit Advances owing to, or to
be made by, such Lender,  such Borrower  shall  promptly  execute and deliver to
such  Lender a Revolving  Credit  Note  payable to the order of such Lender in a
principal amount up to the Commitment of such Lender.

                (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section
9.07(d)  shall  include a control  account,  and a  subsidiary  account for each
Lender,  in which accounts  (taken  together) shall be recorded (i) the date and
amount of each Borrowing made  hereunder,  the type of Advances  comprising such
Borrowing and, if appropriate,  the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
terms of each Assumption  Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and  accepted by it,  (iii) the amount of any  principal  or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from such Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and  (iv) the  amount  of any sum  received  by the  Agent  from  each  Borrower
hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.

                (c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register
pursuant to subsection (b) above,  and by each Lender in its account or accounts
pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of
principal  and  interest  due and payable or to become due and payable from each
Borrower to, in the case of the  Register,  each Lender and, in the case of such
account or accounts,  such Lender, under this Agreement,  absent manifest error;
provided,  however,  that the  failure  of the  Agent or such  Lender to make an
entry,  or any  finding  that an entry is  incorrect,  in the  Register  or such
account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise  affect the  obligations of any
Borrower under this Agreement.

                     CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS AND LENDING

          the Agent),  in each case solely to the extent such fees and  expenses

               (c) No  authorization  or  approval  or other  action  by, and no
          notice to or filing with,  any  governmental  authority or  regulatory

          receive, take or make such authorization,  approval, action, notice or
          filing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (d) This Agreement has been, and each of the Notes of the Company
          to be delivered by it when delivered  hereunder  will have been,  duly

          in accordance with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the

          including, without limitation, any Environmental Action, affecting the
          Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  before  any  court,  governmental
          agency or  arbitrator  that (A) would be  reasonably  likely to have a
          Material  Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed  Litigation) or (B)
          purports to affect the legality,  validity or  enforceability  of this
          Agreement  or  any  Note  or  the  consummation  of  the  transactions

          Schedule 3.01(b) hereto.

               (g) No proceeds of any Advance will be applied in any manner that

          G issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

               (h) The Company is not, and immediately  after the application by
          the  Company  of  the  proceeds  of  each  Advance  will  not  be,  an

               (i) The Company and each of its  Subsidiaries  are in  compliance
          with all applicable laws,  rules,  regulations and orders,  including,
          without  limitation,  ERISA and  Environmental  Laws and Environmental
          Permits, except where the failure to so comply would not be reasonably
          likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (j) To the Company's knowledge,  (i) all past non-compliance with
          any  Environmental  Laws and  Environmental  Permits has been resolved
          without  ongoing  obligations  or costs except where the failure to so
          comply  would  not be  reasonably  likely to have a  Material  Adverse
          Effect and (ii) no circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely
          to (A) form the basis of an  Environmental  Action against the Company
          or any of its  Subsidiaries  or any of their  properties that would be
          reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect or (B) cause any
          such  property  to  be  subject  to  any  restrictions  on  ownership,
          occupancy,  use or  transferability  under any  Environmental Law that
          would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (k) No ERISA  Event  that  would be  reasonably  likely to have a
          Material  Adverse  Effect has  occurred or is  reasonably  expected to
          occur with respect to any Plan.

               (l) Schedule B (Actuarial  Information) to the most recent annual
          report  (Form  5500  Series)  for  each  Plan  whose  "funded  current
          liability  percentage"  is less than 90% and whose  "unfunded  current
          liability"  exceeds  $5,000,000  (as such terms are defined in Section
          302(d)(8) of ERISA), copies of which have been filed with the Internal
          Revenue Service and furnished to the Lenders, is complete and accurate
          and fairly  presents in all material  respects  the funding  status of
          such Plan.

               (m) Neither the Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate has  outstanding
          liability  with  respect  to, or is  reasonably  expected to incur any
          Withdrawal   Liability  to,  any  Multiemployer  Plan  that  would  be
          reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (n) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified
          by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer Plan is
          in reorganization or has been terminated,  within the meaning of Title
          IV of ERISA, and no such Multiemployer Plan is reasonably  expected to
          be in reorganization or to be terminated,  within the meaning of Title
          IV of  ERISA,  where  such  reorganization  or  termination  would  be
          reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (o) Except as set forth in the financial  statements  referred to
          in  Section  4.01(e)  and in  Section  5.01(h),  the  Company  and its
          Subsidiaries  taken as a whole have no material liability with respect
          to "expected post retirement benefit  obligations"  within the meaning
          of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106.

          include,  without limitation,  compliance with ERISA and Environmental
          Laws as provided in Section  5.01(i),  except  where the failure to so
          comply  would  not be  reasonably  likely to have a  Material  Adverse
          Effect.

               (b) Payment of Taxes,  Etc. Pay and discharge,  and cause each of
          its  Subsidiaries  to pay and discharge,  before the same shall become

          likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,  (i) all taxes,  assessments
          and  governmental  charges  or  levies  imposed  upon it or  upon  its
          property  and (ii) all lawful  claims  that,  if  unpaid,  will by law
          become a Lien upon its property;  provided,  however, that neither the
          Company  nor  any of its  Subsidiaries  shall  be  required  to pay or
          discharge  any such tax,  assessment,  charge  or claim  that is being
          contested  in good  faith  and by proper  proceedings  and as to which
          appropriate reserves are being maintained.

               (c)  Maintenance  of Insurance.  Maintain,  and cause each of its

          reputable insurance companies or associations (or continue to maintain

          carried by companies engaged in similar  businesses and owning similar
          properties  in the same  general  areas in which the  Company  or such
          Subsidiary operates.

               (d)  Preservation  of  Corporate  Existence,  Etc.  Preserve  and
          maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain,
          its  corporate   existence,   rights   (charter  and   statutory)  and

          5.02(b) and  provided  further that neither the Company nor any of its
          Subsidiaries  shall be required to preserve  any right or franchise if
          the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  or such  Subsidiary  shall
          determine that the preservation  thereof is no longer desirable in the
          conduct of the business of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case
          may be, and that the loss thereof  would not be  reasonably  likely to
          have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (e) Authorizations.  Obtain, and cause each Designated Subsidiary
          with a  principal  place of  business  outside  the  United  States to

          Plans immediately preceding the plan year in which such reorganization
          or  termination  occurs  by an  amount  exceeding  $75,000,000  in the
          aggregate;

then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the
consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the Company and each other
Borrower, declare the obligation of each Lender to make Advances to be
terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the
request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the
Company and each other Borrower, declare the Advances, all interest thereon and
all other amounts payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable,
whereupon the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and
be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers;
provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order
for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A)
the obligation of each Lender to make Advances to such Borrower (or, if such
event has occurred in respect of the Company, to make Advances to any Borrower)
shall automatically be terminated and (B) the Advances, all such interest and
all such amounts owing by such Borrower (or, if such event has occurred in
respect of the Company, owing by all of the Borrowers) shall automatically
become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers.

                                  Article VII

                                    GUARANTY

                SECTION 7.01 Guaranty.  For valuable  consideration,  receipt
whereof is hereby  acknowledged,  and to induce each Lender to make  Advances to
the  Designated  Subsidiaries  and to  induce  the Agent to act  hereunder,  the
Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each Lender and the
Agent the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise, of all obligations of the Designated Subsidiaries now or hereafter
existing  under this Agreement or the Notes,  whether for  principal,  interest,
fees, indemnities, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "Guaranteed
Obligations"),  and agrees to pay any and all reasonable and documented expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees and


                                       49
<PAGE>


expenses) incurred by the Agent or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this
Guaranty.  Without  limiting the  generality  of the  foregoing,  the  Company's
liability  shall extend to all amounts that  constitute  part of the  Guaranteed
Obligations and that would be owed by any Designated  Subsidiary to the Agent or
any  Lender  under  this  Agreement  and the  Notes  but for the fact  that such
Guaranteed  Obligations are  unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence
of a bankruptcy,  reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Designated
Subsidiary.

                SECTION 7.02 Guaranty Absolute. The Company guarantees that the
Guaranteed  Obligations  will be paid strictly in  accordance  with the terms of
this  Agreement  regardless of any law,  regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the  rights of the
Agent or any Lender with respect  thereto.  The obligations of the Company under
this  Guaranty  are  independent  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or any  other
obligations of any Designated Subsidiary under this Agreement and the Notes, and
a separate  action or actions may be brought and prosecuted  against the Company
to enforce the  obligations of the Company under this Guaranty,  irrespective of
whether any action is brought  against any  Borrower or whether any  Borrower is
joined in any such action or actions.  The  liability of the Company  under this
Guaranty shall be irrevocable,  absolute and unconditional  irrespective of, and
the Company hereby  irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have
in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

          (a) any lack of validity or  enforceability  of this  Agreement or the
     Notes, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

          (b) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment  of, or in any
     other  term  of,  all or any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or any  other
     obligations of any Designated Subsidiary under this Agreement or the Notes,
     or any other  amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure  from this
     Agreement or any Note, including,  without limitation,  any increase in the
     Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to
     any Designated Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

          (c) any  taking,  release  or  amendment  or waiver of or  consent  to
     departure  from  any  other  guaranty,  for  all or  any of the  Guaranteed
     Obligations;

          (d)  any  change,   restructuring  or  termination  of  the  corporate
     structure  or  existence  of  any  Designated  Subsidiary  or  any  of  its
     Subsidiaries;

          (e) any  failure of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Company
     or any  Designated  Subsidiary  any  information  relating to the financial
     condition, operations, properties or prospects of any Designated Subsidiary
     now or in the future known to the Agent or such Lender,  as the case may be
     (the  Company  waiving  any duty on the part of the Agent or the Lenders to
     disclose such information); or


                                       50
<PAGE>


          (f) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute
     of  limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any  representation  by
     the Agent or any Lender that might otherwise constitute a defense available
     to, or a  discharge  of, any  Designated  Subsidiary  or the Company or any
     other guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Designated Subsidiary or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

                SECTION 7.03 Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) The Company hereby
waives  promptness,  diligence,  notice of acceptance  and any other notice with
respect  to any  of  the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and  this  Guaranty  and  any
requirement  that the Agent or any Lender  exhaust  any right or take any action
against any Designated Subsidiary or any other Person, and all other notices and
demands whatsoever.

                (b) The Company hereby waives any right to revoke this Guaranty,
and  acknowledges  that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all
Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

                (c) The Company acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect  benefits from the financing  arrangements  contemplated  by
this Agreement and the Notes and that the waivers set forth in this Section 7.03
are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

                SECTION 7.04 Subrogation. The Company will not exercise any
rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against any Designated Subsidiary or
any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence,  payment, performance
or enforcement of the Company's obligations under this Guaranty or any provision
of this  Agreement or the Notes,  including,  without  limitation,  any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any
right to  participate  in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against
such  Designated  Subsidiary or any other insider  guarantor or any  collateral,
whether or not such claim,  remedy or right arises in equity or under  contract,
statute  or common  law,  including,  without  limitation,  the right to take or
receive from such Designated Subsidiary or any other insider guarantor, directly
or  indirectly,  in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim,  remedy or right, unless and until
all of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other  amounts  payable  under this
Guaranty  shall  have been paid in full in cash and the  Commitments  shall have
expired or  terminated.  If any amount shall be paid to the Company in violation
of the preceding  sentence at any time prior to the later of the payment in full
in cash of the Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty and the  Termination  Date,  such amount shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Agent and Lenders and shall  forthwith be paid to the Agent to be
credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable
under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the


                                       51
<PAGE>



terms of this  Agreement  and any  Notes,  or to be held as  collateral  for any
Guaranteed  Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty  thereafter
arising. If (i) the Company shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all
or  any  part  of  the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  (ii)  all  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations  and all other amounts  payable under this Guaranty shall be paid in
full in cash and (iii) the Termination  Date shall have occurred,  the Agent and
the Lenders will, at the Company's  request and expense,  execute and deliver to
the Company appropriate  documents,  without recourse and without representation
or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Company of
an interest in the  Guaranteed  Obligations  resulting  from such payment by the
Company.

                SECTION 7.05 Continuing Guaranty; Assignments under the Credit
Agreement.  This Guaranty is a continuing  guaranty and shall (a) remain in full
force  and  effect  until  the  later  of the  payment  in  full  in cash of the
Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts  payable under this Agreement and
the  Termination  Date,  (b) be binding upon the  Company,  its  successors  and
assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable by the Agent and the
Lenders  and their  respective  successors,  transferees  and  assigns.  Without
limiting the  generality of the  foregoing  clause (c), any Lender may assign or
otherwise  transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations  under this
Agreement (including,  without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitment,
the Advances  owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person,
and such other Person  shall  thereupon  become  vested with all the benefits in
respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise,  in each case as and
to the extent provided in Section 9.07 of this Agreement.

                SECTION 7.06 No Stay. The Company agrees that, as between (a)
the Company and (b) the Lenders and the Agent, the Guaranteed Obligations of any
Designated  Subsidiary guaranteed by the Company hereunder may be declared to be
forthwith  due and payable as provided in Article VI hereof for purposes of this
Guaranty by  declaration to the Company as guarantor  notwithstanding  any stay,
injunction or other  prohibition  preventing  such  declaration  as against such
Designated  Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration to the Company
as guarantor,  such  Guaranteed  Obligations  (whether or not due and payable by
such  Designated  Subsidiary),  shall  forthwith  become due and  payable by the
Company for purposes of this Guaranty.

                                  Article VIII

                                    THE AGENT

                SECTION 8.01 Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers and discretion  under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Agent by the terms hereof,  together with such powers and  discretion as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including, without limitation,  enforcement or collection of the
Advances),  the Agent shall not be required to exercise any  discretion  or take
any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the


                                       52
<PAGE>


instructions of the Majority  Lenders,  and such  instructions  shall be binding
upon all Lenders and all holders of Advances;  provided, however, that the Agent
shall not be  required  to take any action  that  exposes  the Agent to personal
liability  or that is contrary to this  Agreement or  applicable  law. The Agent
agrees to give to each Lender  prompt  notice of each notice  given to it by any
Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

                SECTION 8.02 Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of
its  directors,  officers,  agents or  employees  shall be liable for any action
taken or  omitted  to be taken by it or them  under or in  connection  with this
Agreement,  except for its or their own gross negligence or willful  misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing,  the Agent: (a) may treat
the Lender that made any Advance as the holder of the Debt  resulting  therefrom
until the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment  and Acceptance  entered into
by such Lender, as assignor,  and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided
in Section 9.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel  (including  counsel for any
Borrower),  independent  public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance  with the advice of such counsel,  accountants or experts;  (c)
makes no warranty or  representation  to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection  with this  Agreement;  (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the  performance  or  observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of any Borrower
or to inspect the property  (including  the books and records) of any  Borrower;
(e) shall not be  responsible  to any  Lender for the due  execution,  legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or
any other instrument or document  furnished pursuant hereto; and (f) shall incur
no  liability  under or in respect of this  Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

                SECTION 8.03 Citibank and Affiliates. With respect to its
Commitment,  the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it,  Citibank  shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise  the same as though it were not the  Agent;  and the term  "Lender"  or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly  indicated,  include Citibank in its
individual capacity.  Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money  to,  act as  trustee  under  indentures  of,  accept  investment  banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company,
any  of its  Subsidiaries  and  any  Person  who  may do  business  with  or own
securities  of the Company or any such  Subsidiary,  all as if Citibank were not
the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

                SECTION 8.04 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has,  independently  and  without  reliance  upon the Agent or any other
Lender and based on the  financial  statements  referred to in Section  4.01 and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,  made its own
credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents


                                       53
<PAGE>


and information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

                SECTION 8.05 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not  reimbursed  by a Borrower),  ratably  according to the
respective  principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Notes then held by each of
them (or if no  Revolving  Credit  Notes are at the time  outstanding  or if any
Revolving  Credit  Notes  are  held by  Persons  that are not  Lenders,  ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments),  from and against any
and  all  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  or  disbursements  of any  kind or  nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in
any way  relating to or arising  out of this  Agreement  or any action  taken or
omitted by the Agent  under this  Agreement,  provided  that no Lender  shall be
liable  for any  portion  of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without limitation of
the  foregoing,  each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent  promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any  out-of-pocket  expenses  (including  counsel fees)
incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration,   modification,   amendment  or  enforcement   (whether  through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities  under, this Agreement,  to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by a Borrower.

                SECTION 8.06 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time
by giving  written  notice  thereof to the Lenders and each  Borrower and may be
removed  at any time with or  without  cause by the  Majority  Lenders  and such
resignation  or removal shall be effective  upon the  appointment of a successor
Agent. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the
right to appoint a successor  Agent,  subject to the Company's  approval  (which
shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).  If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Majority  Lenders,  and shall have accepted  such  appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders,  appoint a successor  Agent,  which shall be a commercial
bank  organized  under the laws of the United  States of America or of any State
thereof  and having a combined  capital  and  surplus of at least  $250,000,000,
subject to the Company's  approval (which shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor  Agent,
such successor Agent shall  thereupon  succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged  from its duties and  obligations  under this
Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                SECTION 9.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this  Agreement or the Revolving  Credit Notes,  nor consent to any
departure by any Borrower therefrom,  shall in any event be effective unless the
same  shall be in  writing  and signed by the  Majority  Lenders,  and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided,  however, that no amendment,  waiver
or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any of the
following: (a) increase the Commitment of any Lender (other than as provided for
in  Section   2.05(c))  or  subject  any  Lender  to  any  additional   monetary
obligations,  (b) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Revolving  Credit
Notes or any fees or other  amounts  payable  hereunder,  (c)  postpone any date
fixed for any payment of  principal  of, or interest  on, the  Revolving  Credit
Notes or any fees or other amounts  payable  hereunder,  (d) release the Company
from any of its  obligations  under  Article VII or limit the  liability  of the
Company  thereunder or (e) amend or waive this Section 9.01 or the definition of
"Majority  Lenders";  and provided further that no amendment,  waiver or consent
shall,  unless in writing  and signed by the Agent in  addition  to the  Lenders
required  above to take such  action,  affect  the rights or duties of the Agent
under this Agreement or any Note.

counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the

                SECTION 9.03 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any
Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under


                                       55
<PAGE>


any Note  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                SECTION 9.04 Costs and Expenses. (a) The Company agrees to pay
or cause to be paid on demand all reasonable  and documented  costs and expenses
of  the  Agent  in  connection  with  the  preparation,   execution,   delivery,
administration,  modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  (A)
all due  diligence,  syndication  (including  printing,  distribution  and  bank
meetings),  transportation,  computer, duplication, messenger costs and expenses
and (B) the  reasonable  fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect
thereto  and  with   respect  to  advising  the  Agent  as  to  its  rights  and
responsibilities  under this  Agreement.  The Company  further  agrees to pay or
cause to be paid on demand all reasonable  and documented  costs and expenses of
the Agent and the Lenders,  if any (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable
counsel fees and expenses),  in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement,  the Notes and
the other documents to be delivered  hereunder,  including,  without limitation,
reasonable  fees and  expenses  of  counsel  for the  Agent  and each  Lender in
connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 9.04(a).

                (b) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent
and each  Lender and each of their  Affiliates  and their  officers,  directors,
employees,  agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified  Party") from and against
any and all  claims,  damages,  losses,  liabilities  and  expenses  (including,
without  limitation,  reasonable  fees  and  expenses  of  counsel)  that may be
incurred by or asserted or awarded against any  Indemnified  Party, in each case
arising out of or in connection  with or by reason of, or in connection with the
preparation  for a defense  of,  any  investigation,  litigation  or  proceeding
arising out of, related to or in connection with the Notes, this Agreement,  any
of the  transactions  contemplated  herein or the actual or proposed  use of the
proceeds  of the  Advances  whether  or not such  investigation,  litigation  or
proceeding  is  brought  by any  Borrower  or  the  directors,  shareholders  or
creditors  of any  Borrower or an  Indemnified  Party or any other Person or any
Indemnified  Party  is  otherwise  a  party  thereto  and  whether  or  not  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby are  consummated,  except to the extent  such
claim,  damage, loss, liability or expense results from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            (c)  Promptly  after  receipt  by an  Indemnified  Party of  notice
of the  commencement  of any action or proceeding  involving any claim,  damage,
loss or liability  referred to in paragraph (b) above,  such  Indemnified  Party
will,  if a claim in respect  thereof is to be made against any  Borrower,  give
written  notice to such Borrower of the  commencement  of such action;  provided
that the  failure of any  Indemnified  Party to give  notice as provided in this
Section  9.04(c)  shall not  relieve  such  Borrower  of its  obligations  under
paragraph  (b) above,  except  only to the extent  that such  Borrower  actually
suffers  damage solely as a result of such failure to give notice.  In the event
that any such action or  proceeding  is brought  against an  Indemnified  Party,
unless in such


                                       56
<PAGE>


Indemnified  Party's  sole  judgment  (based on advise of counsel) a conflict of
interest  between  such  Indemnified  Party and a Borrower  may exist in respect
thereof,  such Borrower  shall be entitled to  participate  in and to assume the
defense thereof with counsel reasonably  satisfactory to such Indemnified Party.
After  notice from such  Borrower to such  Indemnified  Party of its election to
assume  the  defense  thereof,  such  Borrower  shall  not  be  liable  to  such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified  Party in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable
costs of investigation). No Borrower shall consent to the entry of any dismissal
or judgment, or enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened action or
proceeding  against any Indemnified Party that is or could have been a party and
for whom indemnity  could have been sought under paragraph (b) above without the
consent of such Indemnified Party unless such judgment,  dismissal or settlement
includes  as an  unconditional  term  thereof  the giving of a release  from all
liability in respect of such action or  proceeding  to such  Indemnified  Party;
provided that each  Indemnified  Party agrees that, if a Borrower  reconfirms to
such  Indemnified  Party that it is indemnified from all liability in respect of
any such  action or  proceeding  referred  to in the  preceding  sentence,  such
Indemnified  Party  will not enter  into any  settlement  of any such  action or
proceeding  without the consent of such  Borrower  (which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld).  In addition to the foregoing,  each Borrower shall not,
in assuming  the defense of any  Indemnified  Party,  agree to any  dismissal or
settlement  without the prior written consent of such Indemnified  Party if such
dismissal or settlement  (A) would require any admission or  acknowledgement  of
culpability or wrongdoing by such Indemnified Party or (B) would provide for any
nonmonetary relief to any Persons to be performed by such Indemnified Party.

                (d) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar  Rate  Advance or LIBO Rate Advance is made by any Borrower to or for
the account of a Lender  other than on the last day of the  Interest  Period for
such  Advance,  as a result of (i) a payment or  Conversion  pursuant to Section
2.03(d),  2.10 or 2.12, (ii) a Commitment  Increase pursuant to Section 2.05(c),
(iii)  acceleration of the maturity of the Advances  pursuant to Section 6.01 or
for any other reason,  or (iv) by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender other than on
the last day of the  Interest  Period for such  Advance  upon an  assignment  of
rights and  obligations  under this Agreement  pursuant to Section  9.07(a) as a
result of a demand by the Company pursuant to Section 2.17, such Borrower shall,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the
Agent for the  account of such Lender any amounts  required to  compensate  such
Lender for any additional  losses,  costs or expenses that it may reasonably and
actually  incur as a result of such payment or  Conversion,  including,  without
limitation,  any loss (other than loss of anticipated profits),  cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

                (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
any  Borrower  hereunder,  the  agreements  and  obligations  of  such  Borrower
contained in Sections  2.11,  2.14 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of
principal,  interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and relating to the
Advances.

                SECTION 9.05 Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request
or the granting of the consent  specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent
to declare the Advances due and payable  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section
6.01, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  to set off and apply  any and all  deposits
(general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final but excluding  trust
accounts)  at any time held and  other  indebtedness  at any time  owing by such
Lender to or for the credit or the account of any  Borrower  against any and all
of the  obligations  of such  Borrower  now or  hereafter  existing  under  this
Agreement and the Note of such Borrower held by such Lender, whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note. Each Lender
agrees  promptly  to notify the  relevant  Borrower  after any such  set-off and
application,  provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and  application.  The rights of each Lender under this
Section  are in  addition  to other  rights  and  remedies  (including,  without
limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have.

                SECTION 9.06 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become
effective  (other than Sections 2.01 and 2.03, which shall only become effective
upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it
shall have been  executed  by the Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall
have been notified by each Initial  Lender that such Initial Lender has executed
it and  thereafter  shall be  binding  upon and  inure  to the  benefit  of each
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns,
except that no Borrower  shall have the right to assign its rights  hereunder or
any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

                SECTION 9.07 Assignments, Designations and Participations. (a)
Each Lender may at any time, and if demanded by the Company  pursuant to Section
2.17,  shall  assign to one or more  Persons  all or a portion of its rights and
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  all or a
portion of its  Commitment,  the Revolving  Credit  Advances owing to it and the
Revolving  Credit Note or Notes held by it);  provided,  however,  that (i) each
such  assignment  shall be of a constant,  and not a varying,  percentage of all
rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (other  than any right to make
Competitive  Bid Advances,  Competitive Bid Advances owing to it and Competitive
Bid  Notes),  (ii)  except  in the  case  of an  assignment  to a  Person  that,
immediately prior to such assignment,  was a Lender or an assignment of all of a
Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of the
Commitment  of the  assigning  Lender  being  assigned  pursuant  to  each  such
assignment  (determined as of the date of the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  with
respect to such  assignment)  shall in no event be less than  $10,000,000  or an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess  thereof,  (iii) each such assignment
shall be to an Eligible Assignee,  (iv) each such assignment made as a result of
a demand by the  Company  pursuant  to  Section  2.17 shall be  arranged  by the
Company after  consultation  with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of
all of the rights and  obligations of the assigning  Lender under this Agreement
or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations  made  concurrently
with another such assignment or other such  assignments  that together cover all
of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement,  (v)
no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand
by the Company pursuant to Section 2.17 (A) so


                                       58
<PAGE>


long as a Default  shall have occurred and be  continuing,  (B) unless and until
such Lender shall have  received one or more  payments  from either the Company,
any other Borrower or one or more Eligible  Assignees in an aggregate  amount at
least equal to the aggregate  outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing
to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of
such  principal  amount and all other amounts  payable to such Lender under this
Agreement  (including,  but not limited to, any amounts owing under Section 2.11
and  Section  2.14),  and the  Company  shall  have  satisfied  all of its other
obligations  under this Agreement as of the effective date of the assignment and
(C) if any such Eligible  Assignee is not an existing Lender,  the Company shall
have paid to the Agent a  processing  and  recordation  fee of $1,000,  (vi) the
parties to each such assignment  shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with  any  Revolving  Credit  Note  subject  to  such  assignment  and,  if such
assignment  does not occur as a result of a demand by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section  2.17 (in which case the  Company  shall pay the fee  required by clause
(v)(C) of this Section 9.07(a)), a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and
(vii) in the case of an  assignment  to any  Affiliate  of such  Lender  that is
engaged in the business of commercial  banking,  notice  thereof shall have been
given to the Company and the Agent.  Upon such execution,  delivery,  acceptance
and recording,  from and after the effective  date specified in each  Assignment
and Acceptance,  (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and  obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder  and (y) the Lender  assignor  thereunder  shall,  to the extent  that
rights and  obligations  hereunder  have been  assigned  by it  pursuant to such
Assignment  and  Acceptance,  relinquish  its  rights and be  released  from its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the  case  of an  Assignment  and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender  shall cease to be a party
hereto).

                (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the Lender assignor  thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each  other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:  (i) other  than as
provided in such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  such  assigning  Lender makes no
representation  or warranty  and assumes no  responsibility  with respect to any
statements,  warranties or  representations  made in or in connection  with this
Agreement or the execution,  legality,  validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,
sufficiency  or value of this  Agreement  or any other  instrument  or  document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility  with respect to the financial  condition
of any Borrower or the  performance  or observance by any Borrower of any of its
obligations  under this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished
pursuant  hereto;  (iii) such  assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement,  together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section  4.01(e),  the most recent financial  statements  referred to in Section
5.01(h) and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
make its own credit  analysis  and  decision to enter into such  Assignment  and
Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this


                                       59
<PAGE>


Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such
assignee  appoints and  authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers and  discretion  under this  Agreement as are
delegated  to the Agent by the terms  hereof,  together  with  such  powers  and
discretion as are reasonably  incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations  that
by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an  assigning  Lender  and  an  assignee  representing  that  it is an  Eligible
Assignee,  together  with any  Revolving  Credit  Note or Notes  subject to such
assignment,  the  Agent  shall,  if such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  has  been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto,  (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance,  (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to each Borrower.

                (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance  delivered to and accepted
by it and a  register  for the  recordation  of the names and  addresses  of the
Lenders and the  Commitment  of, and principal  amount of the Advances owing to,
each Lender  from time to time (the  "Register").  The  entries in the  Register
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,  absent  manifest  error,  and
each  Borrower,  the Agent and the Lenders  may treat each Person  whose name is
recorded  in the  Register  as a  Lender  hereunder  for  all  purposes  of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower or any
Lender  at any  reasonable  time and from  time to time  upon  reasonable  prior
notice.

                (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities  (other than any Borrower or any of its  Affiliates) in or to all
or a portion of its  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement  (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it
and any Note or Notes held by it);  provided,  however,  that (i) such  Lender's
obligations under this Agreement (including,  without limitation, its Commitment
to any Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely  responsible  to the other  parties  hereto for the  performance  of such
obligations,  (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement,  (iv) each Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders
shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection  with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant
under any such  participation  shall have any right to approve any  amendment or
waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement  or any Note,  or any consent to any
departure by any Borrower  therefrom,  except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Advances or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,  in each case to the extent subject
to such  participation,  or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal
of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,
in each case to the extent  subject to such  participation.  Each Lender  agrees
that,  promptly  upon selling any such  participation  in  accordance  with this
Section  9.07(e),  such  Lender  shall  deliver  written  notice  thereof to the
Company.


                                       60
<PAGE>


                (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed  assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section
9.07,  disclose  to the  assignee,  or  participant  or  proposed  assignee,  or
participant,  any  information  relating  to the  Company or any other  Borrower
furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower;  provided that, prior
to any such  disclosure,  the assignee,  or participant or proposed  assignee or
participant  shall agree to preserve  the  confidentiality  of any  Confidential
Information relating to such Borrower received by it from such Lender.

                (g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement,  any Lender may at any time create a security  interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  the
Advances  owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any  Federal
Reserve Bank in  accordance  with  Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

                SECTION 9.08 Designated Subsidiaries. (a) Designation. The
Company  may at any time,  and from time to time,  by delivery to the Agent of a
Designation  Letter duly executed by the Company and the  respective  Subsidiary
and substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto,  designate such Subsidiary as
a "Designated  Subsidiary"  for purposes of this  Agreement and such  Subsidiary
shall thereupon become a "Designated  Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement
and,  as such,  shall  have all of the  rights  and  obligations  of a  Borrower
hereunder.  The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each such designation
by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary.

                (b) Termination. Upon the payment and performance in full of all
of the  indebtedness,  liabilities  and  obligations  under this  Agreement  and
relating to the Advances of any  Designated  Subsidiary  then, so long as at the
time no Notice of  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing  or  Notice of  Competitive  Bid
Borrowing  in  respect  of  such  Designated  Subsidiary  is  outstanding,  such
Subsidiary's status as a "Designated  Subsidiary" shall terminate upon notice to
such  effect from the Agent to the  Lenders  (which  notice the Agent shall give
promptly upon its receipt of a request  therefor from the Company).  Thereafter,
the Lenders shall be under no further  obligation to make any Advance  hereunder
to such Designated Subsidiary.

                SECTION 9.09 Confidentiality. Neither the Agent nor any Lender
shall  disclose any  Confidential  Information  to any other Person  without the
consent of the relevant Borrower, other than (a) to the Agent's or such Lender's
officers,  directors,  employees,  agents and advisors and, as  contemplated  by
Section 9.07(f), to actual or prospective  assignees and participants,  and then
only  on  a  need-to-know  and   confidential   basis  in  connection  with  the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  (b) pursuant to subpoena or other
legal process or as otherwise  required by law (provided  that the Person making
such disclosure  shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with
notice  thereof),  and (c) as  requested  or required  by any state,  federal or
foreign  authority or examiner  regulating banks or banking having  jurisdiction
over any Lender.

                SECTION 9.10 Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance  with,  the laws of the State of New
York.


                                       61

                SECTION 9.11 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed  in any  number of  counterparts  and by  different  parties  hereto in
separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original  and all of which  taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
agreement.  Delivery of an  executed  counterpart  of a  signature  page to this
Agreement by  telecopier  shall be effective as delivery of a manually  executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

                SECTION 9.12 Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto
hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally  submits to the exclusive  jurisdiction
only of any New York  State  court or  federal  court of the  United  States  of
America sitting in New York City, and any appellate  court from any thereof,  in
any action or  proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement  or the
Notes,  or for  recognition  or  enforcement  of any  judgment,  and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any
such New York State court or, to the extent  permitted  by law, in such  federal
court. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each of the parties hereto agrees
that a final  judgment in any such action or proceeding  shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Each Designated  Subsidiary that has its principal place
of business  outside of the United States of America  hereby agrees that service
of process in any such action or proceeding  may be made upon the Company at its
offices specified in Section 9.02 (the "Process Agent") and each such Designated
Subsidiary hereby irrevocably appoints the Process Agent its authorized agent to
accept such service of process, and agrees that the failure of the Process Agent
to give any notice of any such  service  shall not impair or affect the validity
of such service or of any judgment  rendered in any action or  proceeding  based
thereon.  Each Borrower  hereby further  irrevocably  consents to the service of
process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any
parties  hereto by  registered  or  certified  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to such
Borrower  at its address set forth in Section  9.02.  Nothing in this  Agreement
shall affect any right that any party may otherwise  have to serve legal process
in any  other  manner  permitted  by law.  To the  extent  that  any  Designated
Subsidiary  has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from  jurisdiction  of any
court or from any legal process (whether  through service or notice,  attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,  execution or otherwise) with
respect to itself or its property, such Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably
waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement.

                (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the Notes
in any New York State or federal court of the United  States of America  sitting
in New York City. Each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives, to the
fullest  extent  permitted by law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                           OPINION OF ROBERT M. REESE,
                       VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL
                                 OF THE COMPANY


                                                              [Effective Date]



To each of the Lenders party
  to the Credit Agreement referred
  to below and to Citibank, N.A., as
  Agent for such Lenders


                            Hershey Foods Corporation


Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section
3.01(g)(iv) of the Amended and Restated Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of
November 27, 2001 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Hershey Foods Corporation (the
"Company"), the Lenders party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent
(the "Agent") for said Lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Banc America Securities LLC, as joint lead
arrangers and joint book managers. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are
used herein as therein defined.

                  I am the Vice President and General Counsel of the Company,
and I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation,
execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

                  In that connection, I have examined:

                   (1)     the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes
                   of the Company;

                   (2)     the documents furnished by the Company pursuant to
                   Article III of the Credit Agreement;

                   (3)     the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
                   of the Company and all amendments thereto (the "Charter");and

                   (4)     The by-laws of the Company and all amendments thereto
                   (the "By-laws").

                  I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my
satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of
public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and
other documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. In making such examinations, I have assumed the

<PAGE>

genuineness of all signatures  (other than those on behalf of the Company),  the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to
authentic  original  documents of all  documents  submitted to me as  certified,
conformed or  photographic  copies.  As to  questions  of fact  material to such
opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently  established by me,
relied upon  certificates of the Company or its officers or of public  officials
and as to questions of fact and law, on opinions or  statements by other lawyers
reporting to me. I have assumed the due execution and delivery,  pursuant to due
authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders and the Agent.

                  My opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, where applicable, the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States.

                  Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have
deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:

                  1. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.


                  2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
         the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company's corporate
         powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
         and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Company (including, without
         limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
         Reserve System) or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding
         on or affecting the Company or, to the best of my knowledge, contained
         in any other similar document, except where such contravention would
         not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Credit
         Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Company have been duly
         executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.

                  3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery
         and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes,
         or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
         except for the authorizations, approvals, actions, notices and filings
         (i) listed on Schedule 4.01(c) to the Credit Agreement, all of which
         have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and are in full force and
         effect and (ii) where the Company's failure to receive, take or make
         such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing would not have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  4. There (i) are no pending or, to the best of my knowledge,
         threatened actions, investigations, litigations or proceedings against
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental
         agency or arbitrator that (a) would be reasonably likely to have a
         Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Litigation) or (b)
         purport to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or
         enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated
                                       2
<PAGE>

         thereby, and (ii) there has been no adverse change in the status,
         or financial effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
         a whole, of the Disclosed Litigation from that described
         on Schedule 3.01(b) thereto.

                  This opinion letter may be relied upon by you only in
connection with the transaction being consummated pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person for any other
purpose.


                                                              Very truly yours,

                           TO A DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARY


                                                               [Date]


To each of the Lenders party
     to the Credit Agreement
     referred to below,
     and to Citibank, N.A., as Agent
     for said Lenders


Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  In my capacity as counsel to _____________________
("Designated  Subsidiary"),  I have reviewed  that certain  Amended and Restated
Five-Year  Credit  Agreement,  dated  as  of  November  27,  2001  (the  "Credit
Agreement"),  among Hershey Foods Corporation (the "Company"), the Lenders party
thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Agent") for said Lenders,
Bank of America,  N.A., as  syndication  agent and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and
Banc America  Securities  LLC, as joint lead  arrangers and joint book managers.
Terms  defined in the Credit  Agreement are used herein as therein  defined.  In
connection therewith, I have also examined the following documents:

                  (i)      The Designation Letter (as defined in the Credit
                  Agreement) executed by the Designated Subsidiary.

                  [such other documents as counsel may wish to refer to]

                  I have also reviewed such matters of law and examined the
original, certified, conformed or photographic copies of such other documents,
records, agreements and certificates as I have considered relevant hereto. As to
questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were
not independently established by us, relied upon certificates of the Designated
Subsidiary or of its officers or of public officials and as to questions of fact
and law, on opinions or statements by other lawyers reporting to me. I have
assumed (i) the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of
each of the documents referred to above by all parties thereto other than the
Designated Subsidiary, (ii) the authenticity of all such documents submitted to
us as originals and (iii) the conformity to originals of all such documents
submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies.

                  My opinions expressed below are limited to ________________
and the State of New York.

                  Based upon the foregoing, and upon such investigation as I
have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:

<PAGE>



                  1. The Designated Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly
         incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
         _________________________, (b) is duly qualified in each other
         jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property or in which the
         conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be licensed and
         (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and
         operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted
         and as proposed to be conducted.

                  2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Designated
         Subsidiary of its Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement and its
         Revolving Credit Notes, and the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated thereby, are within the Designated Subsidiary's corporate
         powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
         and do not contravene (i) any provision of the charter or by-laws or
         other constituent documents of the Designated Subsidiary, (ii) any law,
         rule or regulation applicable to the Designated Subsidiary or (iii) any
         contractual or legal obligation or restriction binding on or affecting
         the Designated Subsidiary, except where such contravention would not be
         reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Designation
         Letter and each Revolving Credit Note of the Designated Subsidiary has
         been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Designated
         Subsidiary.

                  3. The Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary, the
         Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Designated
         Subsidiary are, and each other Note of the Designated Subsidiary when
         executed and delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, legal, valid
         and binding obligations of the Designated Subsidiary enforceable in
         accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability
         thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
         moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally or by the application of general principles
         of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
         proceeding in equity or at law), and except that I express no opinion
         as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Courts of the
         United States of America to adjudicate any controversy relating to the
         Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary
         or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary or (ii) the effect of the law
         of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) wherein any
         Lender or Applicable Lending Office may be located or wherein
         enforcement of the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the
         Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary may be
         sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected
         by such Lender.

                  4. There is no pending, or to the best of my knowledge,
         threatened action, investigation, litigation or proceeding at law or in
         equity against the Designated Subsidiary before any court, governmental
         agency or arbitrator that would be reasonably likely to have a Material
         Adverse Effect or that purports to affect the legality, validity,
         binding effect or enforceability of the Designation Letter of the
         Designated Subsidiary, the Credit Agreement or any Revolving Credit
         Note of the Designated Subsidiary, or the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby.

                                       2

                  5. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
         notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
         or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery
         and performance by the Designated Subsidiary of its Designation Letter,
         the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary except
         for such authorizations, consents, approvals, actions, notices or
         filings as have heretofore been made, obtained or affected and are in
         full force and effect.

                  This opinion letter may be relied upon by you only in
connection with the transaction being consummated pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person for any other
purpose.



                                                  Very truly yours,

          <H3 ALIGN="center">MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS</H3>
          <P>
            Hershey Foods Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Corporation")
            are engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of consumer food
            products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line of chocolate
            and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products. The Corporation was
            organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927, as a
            successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey.
          </P>
          <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </H3>
          <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Net Sales </H3>
          <P>
            Net sales rose $336.3 million, or 8%, from 2000 to 2001. The
            increase in 2001 was primarily due to incremental sales from the mint and gum
            businesses acquired from Nabisco, Inc. in December 2000 and increases in sales
            of base confectionery and grocery products, primarily resulting from the
            introduction of new confectionery products, selected confectionery selling
            price increases in the United States, and increased international exports.
            These increases were partially offset by lower sales resulting from the
            divestiture of the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business and the impact of
            unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
          </P>
          <P>
            Net sales rose $250.1 million, or 6%, from 1999 to 2000. The higher
            sales primarily reflected an increase in sales of base confectionery and
            grocery products in North America, including incremental sales from the
            introduction of new confectionery products, increased international exports and
            lower product returns, discounts and allowances. In 2000, certain international
            distributor allowances were netted against sales instead of being reported in
            selling, marketing and administrative expenses as in 1999. Distributor
            allowances in 1999 amounted to $18.3 million. Net sales in 1999 included $29.3
            million related to the Corporation's pasta business, which was sold in January
            1999.
          </P>
          <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Gross Margin </H3>
          <P>
            Gross margin was 41.5% in 2000 and 2001. Gross margin in 2001 was
            negatively impacted 1.1 percentage points from the inclusion in cost of sales
            of a charge of $50.1 million associated with business realignment initiatives
            recorded during the fourth quarter. The $50.1 million charge to cost of sales
            resulted from the reduction of raw material inventories, principally cocoa
            beans and cocoa butter, no longer required to support operations as a result of
            outsourcing the manufacture of certain ingredients. Excluding the impact of the
            business realignment initiatives, the increase in gross margin to 42.6%
            resulted from lower costs for freight, distribution and warehousing, as well as
            improved supply chain efficiencies including decreased costs for the disposal
            of aged finished goods inventory and obsolete packaging. Selected confectionery
            selling price increases and the profitability of the mint and gum business also
            contributed to the higher gross margin in 2001. The impact of these items was
            partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to higher
            labor rates and employee benefits costs, as well as start-up costs associated
            with the installation of new manufacturing equipment.
          </P>
          <P>
            Gross margin increased from 40.7% in 1999 to 41.5% in 2000. The
            increase in gross margin reflected decreased costs for certain major raw
            materials, primarily cocoa, as well as lower product returns, discounts and
            allowances. The impact of these items was offset partially by higher absorption
            of fixed manufacturing costs in 2000, primarily related to decreased finished
            goods inventory levels in 2000 compared to 1999. In addition, the sales mix of
            confectionery items sold in 2000 compared to 1999 contributed to lower
            profitability, as the growth in sales of the more profitable standard bars was
            outpaced by sales of packaged confectionery items. Also, higher distribution
            and warehousing costs in 2000 reflected higher warehouse handling costs and
            incremental costs associated with expanded warehousing capacity.

            Gross margin in 1999 benefited .3 percentage points from the
            inclusion in cost of sales of a one-time $12.5 million gain from revisions to
            the Corporation's retiree medical plan, net of contributions into the Employee
            Savings Stock Investment and Ownership Plan ("ESSIOP"). During the first
            quarter of 1999, the Corporation changed its retiree medical plan to eliminate
            coverage for all eligible hourly employees under age 45, to be replaced by
            annual contributions into the ESSIOP. The change applied primarily to U.S.
            hourly employees working in Pennsylvania. In addition, gross margin in 1999
            would have been .3 percentage points lower if certain international distributor
            allowances were reclassified, as discussed above for 2000.

          <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Selling, Marketing and Administrative </H3>
          <P>
            Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $142.8
            million, or 13%, from 2000 to 2001, primarily reflecting selling, marketing and
            administrative expenditures for the newly acquired mint and gum business,
            increased administrative expenses primarily resulting from higher staffing
            levels to support sales activity in North America and international businesses,
            increased marketing expenses and higher incentive compensation expense.
            Selling, marketing and administrative costs in 2000 included a one-time gain of
            $7.3 million arising from the sale of certain corporate aircraft.
          </P>
          <P>
            Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $69.3
            million, or 7%, from 1999 to 2000, primarily reflecting: increased marketing
            expenditures for base confectionery brands, international exports and the
            introduction of new products; increased selling and administrative expenses
            primarily related to higher staffing levels to support sales and customer
            service activity in North America and the international export business; higher
            incentive compensation expense reflecting improved operating performance in
            2000; and higher software amortization costs. The impact of these items was
            offset partially by the inclusion in administrative expense in 2000 of a
            one-time gain of $7.3 million arising from the sale of certain corporate
            aircraft. Selling, marketing and administrative costs in 1999 included $10.7
            million related to the Corporation's pasta business, which was sold in January
            1999.

            In late October 2001, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved
            a plan to improve the efficiency and profitability of the Corporation's
            operations. The plan included asset management improvements, product line
            rationalization, supply chain efficiency improvements and a voluntary work
            force reduction program. The major components of the plan will be completed by
            the fourth quarter of 2002.
          </P>
          <P>
            During the fourth quarter of 2001, a charge to cost of sales and a
            business realignment and asset impairment charge were recorded totaling $278.4
            million before tax ($171.9 million after tax or $1.25 per share-diluted). The
            total charges included a charge to cost of sales of $50.1 million associated
            with raw material inventory reductions and a business realignment and asset
            impairment charge of $228.3 million (collectively, "the business realignment
            initiatives"). Components of the $228.3 million pre-tax charge included $5.3
            million relating to asset management improvements, $28.3 million relating to
            product line rationalization, $46.0 million relating to supply chain efficiency
            improvements and $148.7 million relating to a voluntary work force reduction
            program. These initiatives are expected to generate $75 million to $80 million
            of annual savings when fully implemented, with less than half the estimated
            amount expected to be realized in 2002. Additional charges totaling
            approximately $31.6 million before tax, or $.14 per share-diluted, are expected
            to be recorded in 2002, as incurred, primarily related to pension settlement
            costs resulting from the voluntary work force reduction program and expenses
            associated with the relocation of manufacturing equipment.
          </P>
          <P>
            The charge to cost of sales of $50.1 million was a result of
            decisions to outsource the manufacture of certain ingredients and to
            significantly reduce the inventory levels of certain raw materials, primarily
            cocoa beans and cocoa butter. Also included in the charge was the impact of a
            decision

            to reduce raw material inventory levels for almonds and peanuts.
            The Corporation sold raw material inventories and delayed raw material
            deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2001. A pre-tax charge of $5.3 million
            was also recorded in the fourth quarter as part of the pre-tax business
            realignment and asset impairments charge. This charge reflected the write-off
            of manufacturing machinery and equipment as a result of the ingredients
            manufacturing outsourcing.
          </P>
          <P>
            Product line rationalization plans include the sale or exit of
            certain businesses, the discontinuance of certain non-chocolate confectionery
            products and the realignment of the Corporation's domestic and international
            sales organizations. The estimated loss on the sale or exit of these businesses
            was $26.4 million as of December 31, 2001, net of estimated sales proceeds. Net
            sales associated with these businesses were approximately $38.0 million, $43.1
            million and $45.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Costs
            associated with the realignment of the sales organizations totaled $1.9
            million, primarily related to sales office closings and terminating the use of
            certain sales brokers.

            To improve supply chain efficiency and profitability, three
            manufacturing facilities, a distribution center and certain other facilities
            will be closed. A net pre-tax charge of $46.0 million was recorded in the
            fourth quarter of 2001 relating to the closure of these facilities. A
            manufacturing facility in Denver, Colorado will be closed, with manufacturing
            equipment and machinery to be sold or relocated for production at a contract
            manufacturer. The Denver, Colorado plant principally manufactures <I>Jolly
            Rancher</I> hard candy. A manufacturing facility in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania
            will also be closed and the production of <I>POT OF GOLD</I> chocolates will be
            moved to another manufacturing plant. Finally, a small manufacturing and
            packaging facility located in Palmyra, Pennsylvania, as well as a distribution
            center and certain minor facilities located in Oakdale, California will be
            closed. The closure of these facilities is expected to result in the
            termination of approximately 750 employees, with total involuntary employee
            termination benefits of approximately $5.0 million.
          </P>
          <P>
            In October 2001, the Corporation offered a voluntary work force
            reduction program ("VWRP") to certain eligible employees in the United States,
            Canada and Puerto Rico in order to reduce staffing levels and improve
            profitability. The VWRP consisted of an early retirement program and an
            enhanced mutual separation program. The early retirement program was offered to
            approximately 1,200 eligible salaried employees who were born prior to January
            1, 1954 and were employed by the Corporation prior to January 1, 1999. The
            early retirement program provided enhanced pension, post-retirement and certain
            supplemental benefits. The enhanced mutual separation program provided
            increased severance and temporary medical benefits. The Corporation expects
            that the VWRP will provide a reduction of approximately 600 employees. Most
            employees accepting the VWRP will end their employment with the Corporation
            during the first quarter of 2002. A total pre-tax charge of $148.7 million was
            recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 upon employee acceptance of the VWRP.
            The charge primarily reflected enhanced retirement and separation benefits.

          <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Interest Expense, Net </H3>
          <P>
            Net interest expense for 2001 was $6.9 million below the prior
            year, reflecting a decrease in short-term interest expense due to a decrease in
            average short-term borrowing rates and reduced average short-term borrowings.
            Net interest expense for 2000 was $1.7 million above the prior year, primarily
            as a result of higher short-term interest expense related to increased average
            short-term borrowings and borrowing rates, and lower capitalized interest. The
            impact of these items in 2000 was offset partially by higher interest income,
            and lower fixed interest expense as a result of interest rate swap and forward
            agreements entered into in October 1999.

            The Corporation's effective income tax rate was 39.7% in 2001,

            on the sale of the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business, the effective income
            tax rate was 37.3% in 2001. The decrease of 1.5 percentage points from 2000 was
            primarily due to the lower tax rate on the newly acquired mint and gum
            business. Excluding the provision for income taxes associated with the gain on
            the sale of the Corporation's pasta business, the effective income tax rate was

            business and the after-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives

            Net income decreased $125.8 million, or 27%, from 1999 to 2000. In
            the first quarter of 1999, the Corporation received cash proceeds of $450.0
            million, retained a 6% minority interest and recorded a gain of approximately
            $243.8 million before tax, $165.0 million or $1.17 per share-diluted after tax,
            as a result of the sale of the Corporation's pasta business. Excluding the

            the after-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives; 7.8% in 2000,
            excluding the after-tax gain on the sale of corporate aircraft; and 7.4% in

            The Corporation's financial condition remained strong during 2001.
            The capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a percent of
            stockholders' equity, short-term and long-term debt) was 44% as of December 31,
            2001, and 49% as of December 31, 2000. The ratio of current assets to current
            liabilities was 1.9:1 as of December 31, 2001, and 1.7:1 as of December 31,
            2000.
          </P>
          <P>
            In September 2001, the Corporation completed the sale of the
            <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business to Pharmacia Consumer Healthcare, a unit
            of Pharmacia Corporation. Included in the sale were the trademarks and
            manufacturing equipment for the throat drops business. Under a supply agreement
            with Pharmacia, the Corporation agreed to manufacture <I>Luden's </I>throat
            drops for up to 19 months after the date of sale. Under a separate services
            agreement, the Corporation agreed to continue to sell, warehouse and distribute
            <I>Luden's</I> throat drops through March 2002. In the third quarter of 2001,
            the Corporation received cash proceeds of $59.9 million and recorded a gain of
            $19.2 million before tax, $1.1 million or $.01 per share-diluted after tax, as
            a result of the transaction. A higher gain for tax purposes primarily reflected
            the low tax basis of the intangible assets included in the sale, resulting in
            taxes on the gain of $18.1 million. Net sales for the <I>Luden's </I>throat
            drops business were $10.2 million, $24.8 million and $29.7 million in 2001,

            In July 2001, the Corporation's Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do

            million. This business had sales of approximately $20 million in 2000. Included
            in the acquisition were the <I>IO-IO</I> brand of hazelnut creme items and the
            chocolate and confectionery products sold under the <I>Visconti </I>brand. Also

            approximately $270 million in 1999. The Corporation's results of operations for
            2000 did not include results of the acquisition, as the transaction was
            completed very late in the year. Had the results of the acquired businesses

            Total assets decreased $200.3 million, or 6%, as of December 31,
            2001, primarily as a result of lower prepaid expenses and other current assets,
            inventories, property, plant and equipment, and intangibles resulting from
            business acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash
            equivalents.
          </P>
          <P>
            Current assets decreased by $127.8 million, or 10%, principally
            reflecting decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets and lower
            inventories. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was
            principally associated with the reclassification of gains and losses on cash
            flow hedging derivatives to accumulated other comprehensive loss upon adoption
            of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended, in 2001.
            The decrease in inventories of $93.0 million primarily reflected lower raw
            material inventories, principally cocoa beans and cocoa butter, as a result of
            the business realignment initiatives. The increase in cash and cash equivalents
            reflected strong cash flows during the year, commodity margin transfers and
            increased cash resulting from the reduction of raw material inventories in
            December under the business realignment initiatives. These increases were
            partially offset by a $95.0 million contribution in December to one of the
            Corporation's pension plans.
          </P>
          <P>
            Property, plant and equipment was lower than the prior year
            primarily due to depreciation expense of $153.5 million and the planned sale of
            businesses and asset impairment write-downs of $45.3 million resulting from the
            business realignment initiatives, partially offset by capital additions of
            $160.1 million. The decrease in intangibles resulting from business
            acquisitions primarily reflected the amortization of intangibles, $30.8 million
            associated with the sale of the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business and the
            write-down of goodwill of approximately $7.8 million associated with the
            planned sale of businesses under the business realignment initiatives. The
            increase in other non-current assets was primarily a result of pension plan
            minimum liability adjustments reflecting lower asset returns and higher
            liabilities related to the VWRP.
          </P>
          <H3>Liabilities</H3>
          <P>
            Total liabilities decreased by $172.5 million, or 8%, as of
            December 31, 2001, primarily reflecting a reduction in short-term borrowings as
            a result of a significant increase in operating cash flows in 2001. The
            increase in accrued liabilities was primarily the result of higher accruals for
            enhanced employee benefits and other liabilities associated with business
            realignment initiatives recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001.

            Historically, the Corporation's major source of financing has been
            cash generated from operations. The Corporation's income and, consequently,
            cash provided from operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales
            patterns, the timing of new product introductions, business acquisitions and
            divestitures, and price increases. Chocolate, confectionery and grocery
            seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the third
            and fourth quarters of the year, representing the principal seasonal effect.
            Generally, seasonal working capital needs peak during the summer months and
            have been met by issuing commercial paper.
          </P>
          <P>
            Over the past three years, cash provided from operating activities
            exceeded cash requirements for share repurchases, dividend payments, capital
            expenditures and capitalized software additions by $88.4 million. Total debt,
            including debt assumed, decreased during the period by $340.2 million,
            reflecting reduced short-term borrowings and the repayment of long-term debt.
            Cash and cash equivalents increased by $95.1 million during the period.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Corporation anticipates that capital expenditures and
            capitalized software additions will be in the range of $150 million to $200
            million per annum during the next several years as a result of continued
            efficiency improvements in existing facilities and capacity expansion to
            support sales growth and new products, along with continued improvement and
            enhancements of computer software. As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation's
            principal capital commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion to
            support sales growth and new products, modernization and efficiency
            improvements.

            In February 2001, the Corporation made a $75.0 million contribution
            to its domestic pension plans to improve the funded status and, in December
            2001, an additional contribution of $95.0 million was made to fund anticipated
            payments related to the early retirement program implemented in the fourth
            quarter of 2001. The Corporation anticipates additional funding requirements
            for its domestic pension plans in 2002, reflecting asset performance and
            interest rate levels.

            The Corporation has entered into certain commitments for the
            purchase of raw materials. Purchase commitments primarily reflect forward
            contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and
            dealers.

          <P>
            The Corporation has entered into three off-balance sheet
            arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities.
            The operating lease arrangements are with special purpose trusts ("SPTs")
            whereby the Corporation leases warehouse and distribution facilities in
            Redlands, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Hershey, Pennsylvania, as discussed
            below. The SPTs were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent
            leasing of the facilities to the Corporation. The SPTs financed the acquisition
            of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent
            third-party financial institutions. The independent third-party financial
            institutions who hold the equity certificates are owners of the SPTs. The
            Corporation's transactions with the SPTs are limited to the operating lease
            agreements and the associated rent expense is included in cost of sales in the
            Consolidated Statements of Income. The Corporation has not entered into any
            other arrangements involving special purpose entities.
          </P>
          <P>
            The leases include substantial residual guarantees by the
            Corporation for the majority of the financing and options to purchase the
            facilities at original cost. If the Corporation were to exercise its options to
            purchase the three facilities at original cost at the end of the respective
            initial lease terms, the Corporation could purchase the facilities for a total
            of approximately $120.0 million, $79.9 million for the Pennsylvania and Georgia
            facilities in 2005, and $40.1 million for the California facility in 2007.

            In December 2000, the Corporation entered into an operating lease
            agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in
            Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with
            occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement
            contained an option for the Corporation to purchase the facility. In January
            2002, the Corporation assigned its right to purchase the facility to an SPT
            that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the Corporation
            under a new operating lease agreement. The lease term is five years, with up to
            four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The
            cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1
            million.

            In October 2000, the Corporation entered into an operating lease

            near Atlanta, Georgia. The lease term is five years, with up to four renewal
            periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by
            the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $18.2 million.

            In July 1999, the Corporation entered into an operating lease

            distribution facility located on land owned by the Corporation near Hershey,
            Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor paid construction costs totaling
            $61.7 million. The lease term is six years, including the one-year construction
            period, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of
            the lessor.

            In 1999, the Corporation implemented an enterprise-wide integrated
            information system in the United States. The first phase of system
            implementation included new business systems and processes related to
            purchasing, accounts payable, fixed assets, the general ledger, production
            reporting and tracking of plant inventories. The second phase of system
            implementation included systems and processes in the areas of sales order and
            billing, transportation planning and management, electronic data interchange
            communications with warehouses, finished goods inventories, accounts receivable
            and tracking of marketing promotions. Initial implementation costs amounted to
            approximately $101.0 million of capitalized software and hardware and $10.6
            million of expenses. These expenditures were financed with cash provided from
            operations and proceeds from the sale of the Corporation's pasta business.

            shares of its Common Stock to be held as Treasury Stock from the Milton Hershey
            School Trust for $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2001, a total of 44,311,870
            shares were held as Treasury Stock and $84.2 million remained available for
            repurchases of Common Stock under a program approved by the Corporation's Board

            In March 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95% Notes
            under a November 1993 Form S-3 Registration Statement. In August 1997, the
            Corporation filed another Form S-3 Registration Statement under which it could
            offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $500 million of additional debt
            securities. Also in August 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6.95%
            Notes due 2012 and $250 million of 7.2% Debentures due 2027 under the November
            1993 and August 1997 Registration Statements. Proceeds from the debt issuance
            were used to repay a portion of the short-term borrowings associated with the
            purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. As of December
            31, 2001, $250 million of debt securities remained available for issuance under
            the August 1997 Registration Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250
            million of debt securities available under the shelf registration may be used
            for general corporate requirements, which include reducing existing commercial
            paper borrowings, financing capital additions and share repurchases, and
            funding future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.

            As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation maintained short-term and
            long-term committed credit facilities with a syndicate of banks in the amount
            of $400 million which could be borrowed directly or used to support the
            issuance of commercial paper. The Corporation may increase the credit
            facilities to $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the banks. In November 2001,
            the short-term credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a credit
            limit of $200 million expiring in November 2002, and the long-term committed
            credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a $200 million credit
            limit expiring in November 2006. The credit facilities may be used to fund
            general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in
            certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions. The Corporation
            also had lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks of
            $21.7 million and $27.5 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

            The Corporation negotiated a settlement with the Internal Revenue
            Service ("IRS") of its Corporate Owned Life Insurance ("COLI") program
            effective October 1, 2001. The resulting Closing Agreement with the IRS limited
            the COLI interest expense deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted
            in the surrender of all insurance policies, thereby ending the COLI program.
            The settlement is a complete resolution of all federal and state tax aspects of
            this program.

            Over the past three years, cash from operating activities provided
            approximately $1.4 billion. Over this period, cash used by or provided from
            accounts receivable and inventories has tended to fluctuate as a result of
            sales during December and inventory management practices. Cash provided from
            inventories was principally associated with a reduction of raw material
            inventories in December 2001 as part of the Corporation's business realignment
            initiatives. The change in cash required for or provided from other assets and
            liabilities between the years was primarily related to hedging transactions,
            the timing of payments for accrued liabilities, including income taxes, and
            variations in the funded status of pension plans.

            short-term borrowings in the form of commercial paper or bank borrowings were
            used to purchase Nabisco's mint and gum businesses, fund seasonal working
            capital requirements, and finance share repurchase programs. During the past
            three years, a total of 8,439,518 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased
            for $458.3 million, including 1,579,779 shares purchased from the Milton
            Hershey School Trust for $100.0 million. Cash used for incentive plan
            transactions of $116.2 million during the past three years was partially offset
            by cash received from the exercise of stock options of $73.5 million. Cash used
            by incentive plan transactions reflected purchases of the Corporation's Common
            Stock in the open market to replace treasury stock issued for stock options
            exercises.

            The Corporation utilizes certain derivative instruments, from time
            to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange
            contracts and commodities futures contracts, to manage interest rate, currency
            exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures. Interest rate swaps
            and foreign currency contracts are entered into for periods consistent with
            related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of
            those exposures. Commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying
            periods and are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price
            risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements
            and transportation costs. The Corporation does not hold or issue derivative
            instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with
            leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, the
            Corporation has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability
            of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Corporation does
            not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

            In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")

            derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or
            liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that
            changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings
            unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for
            qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses to offset related
            results on the hedged item in the income statement, to the extent effective,
            and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the

            SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of

            In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest
            rate exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
            swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate
            swap agreements that effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
            payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%.
            As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a
            liability of $2.7 million. The potential loss in fair value of interest rate
            swaps resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of
            ten percent was not material as of December 31, 2001.

            The Corporation enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to
            hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase equipment,
            certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies and
            to hedge payment of intercompany transactions with its non-domestic
            subsidiaries. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate
            movements. Foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3
            to 24 months.
          </P>
          <P>
            Foreign exchange forward contracts are intended to be and are
            effective as hedges of firm, identifiable, foreign currency commitments. Prior
            to January 1, 2001, the Corporation accounted for foreign exchange forward
            contracts in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.

            As of January 1, 2001, the Corporation accounted for foreign
            exchange forward contracts under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Foreign exchange
            forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedging derivatives and the fair
            value of such contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
            either an asset or liability. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded
            as a component of other comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings

            The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was estimated

            The potential loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts
            resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of ten

            The Corporation's most significant raw material requirements
            include cocoa, sugar, milk, peanuts and almonds. The Corporation attempts to
            minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of
            these raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future
            manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With
            regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain
            dairy products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures
            contracts. At the present time, active futures contracts are not available for
            use in pricing the Corporation's other major raw material requirements. Futures
            contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn
            sweetener, natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to
            take advantage of market fluctuations which provide more favorable pricing
            opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy
            requirements. Fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price
            fluctuations associated with the Corporation's transportation costs. The
            Corporation's commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk
            of future price increases, but also may potentially limit the ability to
            benefit from possible price decreases.

          <P>
            The cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity
            futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations
            attributable to a variety of factors, including the effect of weather on crop
            yield, other imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates,
            political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences. Cocoa
            prices in 2001 rebounded from the historical lows established at the end of
            2000. Less favorable climatic conditions combined with a recovery in demand,
            particularly in Eastern Europe, resulted in a decrease of world stocks of
            cocoa. During 2002, a continued reduction in available cocoa stocks could
            result in future price increases. The Corporation's costs during 2002 will not
            necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing
            practices, premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying
            delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of
            cocoa beans.

            commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of
            price fluctuations. Prior to January 1, 2001, accounting for commodities
            futures contracts was in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards No. 80, <I>"Accounting for Futures Contracts.</I>" Futures contracts
            met the hedge criteria and were accounted for as hedges. Accordingly, gains and

            The following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the
            Corporation to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent,
            based on the Corporation's net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally
            throughout the year. The Corporation's net commodity positions consist of the
            excess of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts for
            the same commodities, relating to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas,
            fuel oil and certain dairy products. Inventories, priced forward contracts and
            estimated anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the
            sensitivity analysis calculations. A loss is defined, for purposes of
            determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the
            opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The
            fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or
            estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with
            the future delivery period.

            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
            management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
            of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
            and expenses during the period. Significant accounting policies employed by the

            Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to
            the portrayal of the Corporation's financial condition and results of

            judgements, as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of
            matters that are inherently uncertain. The Corporation's most critical
            accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to accounts
            receivable&#151;trade, accrued liabilities, and pension and other

            Costs associated with the possible return of unsaleable products
            are included as a reduction to net sales as part of the provision for returns,
            discounts and allowances. An accrued liability is determined using statistical
            analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales
            patterns, and product movement at retail.

            The Corporation's policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in
            accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the Employee
            Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and federal income tax laws,
            respectively. Non-domestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with
            applicable local laws and regulations. Plan assets are invested in a broadly
            diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international common
            stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities
            associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial
            calculations. These calculations are made considering payroll and employee
            data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at
            the date of the financial statements. The Corporation takes into consideration
            long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest
            rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With
            regard to liabilities associated with post-retirement benefit plans that
            provide health care and life insurance, the Corporation takes into
            consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
            the covered health care benefits.

            The Corporation anticipates that the total U.S. confectionery
            market will grow at a rate of two to three percent in 2002. The Corporation
            intends to increase spending on marketing and selling programs compared to
            2001, as the cost savings generated by the business realignment initiatives are
            invested substantially in enhanced brand building and selling capabilities.
            Annual savings of approximately $75 million to $80 million are anticipated when
            the business realignment initiatives are fully implemented, with less than half
            the estimated amount expected to be realized in 2002.

            Variability of gross margin in future periods is affected by
            various factors, including raw material and logistics costs, manufacturing
            efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period. The Corporation
            expects margin expansion in 2002, as the Corporation anticipates sales
            increases in more profitable product lines, improved operating efficiencies
            throughout the supply chain and the exit of certain under-performing
            businesses. In addition, commodity costs are anticipated to be relatively
            stable in 2002 as a result of the Corporation's forward purchasing and hedging
            practices.

            The Corporation intends to achieve earnings per share growth of
            nine to eleven percent from sales volume increases in response to increased
            spending on marketing and selling capabilities, by expanding gross margin and
            by reducing administrative costs. As a result of the VWRP, the Corporation's
            salaried work force will be reduced by approximately 600 employees during 2002.
            The on-going effective income tax rate is projected to be consistent with 2001,

            The Corporation expects strong cash flows from operating activities
            in 2002. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash
            requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and
            anticipated dividend payments.

            The Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the FASB addressed
            several issues related to the income statement classification of certain sales
            incentives and marketing promotion programs (see Recent Accounting
            Pronouncements in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
            Reclassifications made in 2002 will not affect the Corporation's financial
            position or net income. These reclassifications will reduce the Corporation's
            gross profit and margin, while other percent of sales measures will increase.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Corporation has not fully assessed the potential impact of the
            adoption of SFAS No. 142 (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the
            Consolidated Financial Statements). However, it is estimated that earnings per
            share-diluted will increase by approximately $.10 in 2002 as substantially all
            amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets will be eliminated. The
            Corporation's growth goal for earnings per share of nine to eleven percent does
            not include the impact of changes to accounting methods to be implemented in
            2002.

          <P>
            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
            management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
            of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
            at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
            and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
            those estimates, particularly for accounts receivable and certain current and
            long-term liabilities.

            delivery appointment with the customer has been made; the product has been
            shipped in accordance with the delivery appointment and the required lead time;

            natural gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing
            requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Corporation enters into
            commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of
            price fluctuations. Prior to January 1, 2001, accounting for commodities
            futures contracts was in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards No. 80, "<I>Accounting for Futures Contracts.</I>" Futures contracts
            met the hedge criteria and were accounted for as hedges. Accordingly, gains and
            losses were deferred and recognized in cost of sales as part of the product
            cost.

            The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1,
            2001. SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of the gain
            or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow
            hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
            be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
            transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative
            instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. All derivative
            instruments currently utilized by the Corporation, including commodities
            futures contracts, are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
            Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with
            derivative instruments is contained in Note 5, Derivative Instruments and
            Hedging Activities.

          <H3 ALIGN="left">Property, Plant and Equipment </H3>
          <P>
            Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and are
            depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
            assets, as follows: 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment; and 25 to 40
            years for buildings and related improvements. Maintenance and repair
            expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Applicable interest charges
            incurred during the construction of new facilities and production lines are
            capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized over the assets'
            estimated useful lives.
          </P>
          <H3 ALIGN="left">Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions
            </H3>
          <P>
            Intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions principally
            consist of the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net
            assets of businesses acquired (goodwill). Goodwill was $388.7 million and
            $431.8 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in
            goodwill primarily reflected the disposition of the <I>Luden's</I> throat drops
            business in September 2001 and the impact of product line rationalization
            decisions, including the planned sale of certain businesses, as part of the
            Corporation's business realignment initiatives recorded in the fourth quarter
            of 2001. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Other
            intangible assets were $40.4 million and $42.6 million as of December 31, 2001
            and 2000, respectively. Other intangible assets are amortized on a
            straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives, up to 40 years.
            The Corporation periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have
            occurred indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible
            assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that goodwill should be
            evaluated for possible impairment, the Corporation uses an estimate of the
            acquired business' undiscounted future cash flows compared to the related
            carrying amount of net assets, including goodwill, to determine if an
            impairment loss should be recognized. When factors indicate that other
            intangible assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Corporation
            uses an estimate of the associated undiscounted future cash flows compared to
            the related carrying amount of assets to determine if an impairment loss should
            be recognized.

          <P>
            Accumulated amortization of intangible assets resulting from
            business acquisitions was $131.0 million and $135.5 million as of December 31,

            No. 00-14, <I>"Accounting for Coupons, Rebates and Discounts</I>," and EITF
            Issue No. 00-25, "<I>Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration

            In June 2001, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting

            142, "<I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>" ("SFAS No. 142"). SFAS No.
            141 changes the accounting for business combinations, requiring that all
            business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method and that
            intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise
            from contractual or other legal rights, or if they are separable or capable of
            being separated from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed,
            rented or exchanged. SFAS No. 141 is effective for all business combinations
            initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 specifies the financial accounting
            and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and
            intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but
            rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. SFAS No. 142 is
            effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
          </P>
          <P>
            SFAS No. 142 requires that the useful lives of intangible assets
            acquired on or before June 30, 2001 be reassessed and the remaining
            amortization periods adjusted accordingly. Previously recognized intangible
            assets deemed to have indefinite lives shall be tested for impairment. Goodwill
            recognized on or before June 30, 2001, shall be assigned to one or more
            reporting units and shall be tested for impairment as of the beginning of the
            fiscal year in which SFAS No. 142 is initially applied in its entirety.

            The adoption of SFAS No. 142 is effective for the Corporation as of
            January 1, 2002. The reassessment of intangible assets must be completed during
            the first quarter of 2002 and the assignment of goodwill to reporting units,
            along with completion of the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment
            tests, must be completed during the first six months of 2002. The majority of
            the intangible assets and goodwill recognized prior to July 1, 2001 will no
            longer be amortized effective January 1, 2002. Total amortization of intangible

            early retirement program provided enhanced pension, post-retirement and certain
            supplemental benefits. The enhanced mutual separation program provided
            increased severance and temporary medical benefits. The Corporation expects
            that the VWRP will provide a reduction of approximately 600 employees. Most
            employees accepting the VWRP will end their employment with the Corporation
            during the first quarter of 2002. A total pre-tax charge of $148.7 million was
            recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 upon employee acceptance of the VWRP.
            The charge primarily reflected enhanced retirement and separation benefits.

            The Corporation has entered into three off-balance sheet
            arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities.
            The operating lease arrangements are with special purpose trusts ("SPTs")
            whereby the Corporation leases warehouse and distribution facilities in
            Redlands, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Hershey, Pennsylvania, as discussed
            below. The SPTs were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent
            leasing of the facilities to the Corporation. The SPTs financed the acquisition
            of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent
            third-party financial institutions. The independent third-party financial
            institutions who hold the equity certificates are owners of the SPTs. The
            Corporation's transactions with the SPTs are limited to the operating lease
            agreements and the associated rent expense is included in cost of sales in the
            Consolidated Statements of Income. The Corporation has not entered into any
            other arrangements involving special purpose entities.
          </P>
          <P>
            The leases include substantial residual guarantees by the
            Corporation for the majority of the financing and options to purchase the
            facilities at original cost. If the Corporation were to exercise its options to
            purchase the three facilities at original cost at the end of the respective
            initial lease terms, the Corporation could purchase the facilities for a total
            of approximately $120.0 million, $79.9 million for the Pennsylvania and Georgia
            facilities in 2005, and $40.1 million for the California facility in 2007.

            In December 2000, the Corporation entered into an operating lease
            agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in
            Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with
            occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement
            contained an option for the Corporation to purchase the facility. In January
            2002, the Corporation assigned its right to purchase the facility to an SPT
            that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the Corporation
            under a new operating lease agreement. The lease term is five years, with up to
            four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The
            cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1
            million.

            periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by
            the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $18.2 million.

            In July 1999, the Corporation entered into an operating lease

            distribution facility located on land owned by the Corporation near Hershey,
            Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor paid construction costs totaling
            $61.7 million. The lease term is six years, including the one-year construction
            period, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of

            The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1,

          <H3 ALIGN="left">Objectives, Strategies and Accounting Policies
            Associated with Derivative Instruments </H3>
          <P>
            The Corporation utilizes certain derivative instruments, from time
            to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange
            contracts and commodities futures contracts, to manage variability in cash
            flows associated with interest rate, currency exchange rate and commodity
            market price risk exposures. The interest rate swaps and foreign currency
            contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying
            exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures.
            Commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are
            intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated
            with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation
            costs. If it is probable that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur
            either by the end of the originally specified time period or within an
            additional two-month period of time, derivative gains and losses reported in
            accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are
            immediately reclassified into earnings. Gains and losses on terminated
            derivatives designated as hedges are accounted for as part of the originally
            hedged transaction. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges of
            items that mature or are sold or terminated, are recognized in income in the
            same period as the originally hedged transaction was anticipated to affect
            earnings. The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments as cash flow hedges
            and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. In
            entering into these contracts, the Corporation has assumed the risk that might
            arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
            contracts. The Corporation does not expect any losses as a result of
            counterparty defaults.

          <H3 ALIGN="left">Interest Rate Swaps </H3>
          <P>
            In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest
            rate exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
            swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate
            swap agreements that effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
            payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate. Rental
            payments on operating leases associated with the financing of construction of a
            warehouse and distribution facility near Hershey, Pennsylvania for $61.7
            million and the financing of the purchase of a warehouse and distribution
            facility near Atlanta, Georgia for $18.2 million are variable based on the
            London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). Such contingent operating lease rental
            payments are forecasted transactions as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended.
            The interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the
            interest-rate-contingent rental payments on the operating leases from LIBOR to
            a fixed rate of 6.1%. The interest rate swap agreements qualify as cash flow
            hedges and the notional amounts, interest rates and terms of the swap
            agreements are consistent with the underlying operating lease agreements they
            are intended to hedge and, therefore, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Gains
            and losses on the interest rate swap agreements are included in other
            comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales as part of shipping
            and distribution expense in the same period as the hedged rental payments
            affect earnings.
          </P>
          <P>
            The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was determined
            based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial
            instruments and was included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other
            long-term liabilities, with the offset reflected in accumulated other
            comprehensive loss, net of income taxes. Cash flows from interest rate swap
            agreements are classified as net cash provided from operating activities on the
            Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Corporation's risk related to the
            interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the
            agreements at prevailing market rates.

            denominated in foreign currencies, and to hedge payment of
            intercompany transactions with its non-domestic subsidiaries. These contracts
            reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. Foreign currency price risks
            are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months.

          <P>
            Foreign exchange forward contracts are intended to be and are
            effective as hedges of firm, identifiable, foreign currency commitments. Since
            there is a direct relationship between the foreign currency derivatives and the
            foreign currency denomination of the transactions, foreign currency derivatives
            are highly effective in hedging cash flows related to transactions denominated
            in the corresponding foreign currencies. These contracts meet the criteria for
            cash flow hedge accounting treatment and, accordingly, gains and losses are
            included in other comprehensive income and are recognized in cost of sales or
            selling, marketing and administrative expense in the same period that the
            hedged items affect earnings. In entering into these contracts the Corporation
            has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of
            counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Corporation does not
            expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.
          </P>
          <P>
            The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was estimated
            by obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
            necessary for maturity differences, and was included on the Consolidated
            Balance Sheets as accrued liabilities with the offset reflected in accumulated
            other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes. Cash flows from foreign exchange
            forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency price risks
            associated with the purchase of equipment are classified as net cash flows
            (used by) provided from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of
            Cash Flows. Cash flows from other foreign exchange forward contracts are
            classified as net cash provided from operating activities.

            In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners,
            natural gas and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing
            requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Corporation enters into
            commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of
            price fluctuations. Commodity price risks are hedged generally for periods from
            3 to 24 months. Commodities futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are
            accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses are included
            in other comprehensive income and are recognized ratably in cost of sales in
            the same period that the hedged raw material manufacturing requirements are
            recorded in cost of sales.
          </P>
          <P>
            In order to qualify as a hedge of commodity price risk, it must be
            demonstrated that the changes in fair value of the commodities futures
            contracts are highly effective in hedging price risks associated with commodity
            purchases for manufacturing requirements and with transportation costs. The
            assessment of hedge effectiveness for commodities futures is performed on a
            quarterly basis by calculating the change in switch values relative to open
            commodities futures contracts being held and the number of futures contracts
            needed to price raw material purchases for anticipated manufacturing
            requirements and to hedge transportation costs. Effectiveness is also monitored
            by tracking changes in basis differentials as discussed below. The prices of
            commodities futures contracts reflect delivery to the same locations where the
            Corporation takes delivery of the physical commodities and, therefore, there is
            no ineffectiveness resulting from differences in location between the
            derivative and the hedged item. Commodities futures contracts have been deemed
            to be highly effective in hedging price risks associated with corresponding raw
            material purchases for manufacturing requirements and transportation costs.
          </P>
          <P>
            Because of the rollover strategy used for commodities futures
            contracts, which is required by futures market conditions, some ineffectiveness
            may result in hedging forecasted manufacturing requirements as futures
            contracts are switched from nearby contract positions to contract positions
            which are required to fix the price of raw material purchases for manufacturing
            requirements. Hedge ineffectiveness may also result from variability in basis
            differentials associated with the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing
            requirements. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured on a quarterly

            Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of
            physical forward purchase contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the
            value of futures contracts (unrealized gains and losses) are made on a daily
            basis and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income
            taxes, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such cash transfers will be offset
            by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw
            materials, energy requirements and transportation costs in the future. Cash
            flows from commodities futures contracts are classified as net cash provided
            from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Futures
            contracts being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of
            unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated
            manufacturing requirements for each commodity. Physical commodity forward
            purchase contracts meet the SFAS No. 133 definition of "normal purchases and
            sales" and, therefore, are not considered derivative instruments.

            Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive
            income (loss) to income, for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives,
            were reflected in cost of sales. Gains on cash flow hedging derivatives
            recognized in cost of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were
            approximately $1.7 million before tax for the year ended December 31, 2001. No
            gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from
            accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income as a result of the
            discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted
            transaction would not occur. There were no components of gains or losses on
            cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such
            components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

            The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and
            cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
            approximated fair value as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, because of the
            relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term
            debt, including the current portion, was $877.9 million as of December 31,
            2001, compared to a fair value of $957.8 million based on quoted market prices
            for the same or similar debt issues. The carrying value of long-term debt,
            including the current portion, was $878.2 million as of December 31, 2000,
            compared to a fair value of $920.4 million.

          <P>
            As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation had foreign exchange
            forward contracts maturing in 2002 and 2003 to purchase $24.3 million in
            foreign currency, primarily British sterling and euros, and to sell $12.2
            million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward
            rates.

          <P>
            As of December 31, 2000, the Corporation had foreign exchange
            forward contracts maturing in 2001 and 2002 to purchase $36.3 million in
            foreign currency, primarily British sterling and euros, and to sell $11.5
            million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward
            rates.
          </P>
          <P>
            The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated
            by obtaining quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where
            necessary for maturity differences. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the fair
            value of foreign exchange forward contracts approximated the contract value.
            The Corporation does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
            purposes.

          <P>
            In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest
            rate exposure, the Corporation, from time to time, enters into interest rate
            swap agreements. In February 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate
            swap agreements that effectively convert interest-rate-contingent rental
            payments on certain operating leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%.
            As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a
            liability of $2.7 million.

          <P>
            Generally, the Corporation's short-term borrowings are in the form
            of commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or
            less. As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation maintained short-term and
            long-term committed credit facilities with a syndicate of banks in the amount
            of $400 million which could be borrowed directly or used to support the
            issuance of commercial paper. The Corporation may increase the credit
            facilities to $1.0 billion with the concurrence of the banks. In November 2001,
            the short-term credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a credit
            limit of $200 million expiring in November 2002, and the long-term committed
            credit facility agreement was amended and restated with a credit limit of $200
            million expiring in November 2006. The credit facilities may be used to fund
            general corporate requirements, to support commercial paper borrowings and, in
            certain instances, to finance future business acquisitions.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Corporation also maintains lines of credit with domestic and
            international commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various
            currencies up to approximately $21.7 million and $27.5 million as of December
            31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, at the lending banks' prime commercial
            interest rates or lower.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Corporation had short-term foreign bank loans against its
            credit facilities and lines of credit of $7.0 million as of December 31, 2001,
            and combined domestic commercial paper borrowings and short-term foreign bank
            loans of $257.6 million as of December 31, 2000. The amount of the
            Corporation's short-term borrowings peaked in August 2001 at $304.7 million.
            The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding as of
            December 31, 2001 and 2000, were 0.2% and 6.4%, respectively.
          </P>
          <P>
            The credit facilities and lines of credit were supported by
            commitment fee arrangements. The average fee during 2001 was less than .2% per
            annum of the commitment. The Corporation's credit facility agreements contain a
            financial covenant which requires that a specified income to interest ratio be
            maintained. These agreements are also subject to other representations and
            covenants which do not materially restrict the Corporation's activities. The
            Corporation is in compliance with all covenants included in the credit facility
            agreements. There were no significant compensating balance agreements which
            legally restricted these funds.

            of this subsidiary is subject to a lower income tax rate in both the United
            States and Puerto Rico. The U.S. IRC Section 936 incentive is scheduled to
            expire on December 31, 2005.

          <P>
            The gain on sale of <I>Luden's</I> throat drops business primarily
            reflected the lower tax basis of the intangible assets included in the sale,
            resulting in a higher effective income tax rate.
          </P>
          <P>
            Effective October 1, 2001, the Corporation negotiated a settlement
            with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of Notices of Proposed Deficiency
            associated with its Corporate Owned Life Insurance ("COLI") program. The
            resulting Closing Agreement with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense
            deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted in the surrender of all
            insurance policies, thereby ending the COLI program. The settlement reflected
            the complete resolution of all federal and state tax aspects of the program.

            In February 2001, the Corporation made a $75.0 million contribution
            to its domestic pension plans to improve the funded status. In December 2001,
            the Corporation made a $95.0 million contribution to one of its domestic
            pension plans to fund anticipated payments related to the early retirement
            program.

            The Corporation's acquisition of Nabisco's mint and gum businesses
            in December 2000, included its Hourly Pension Plan for employees at the Las
            Piedras, Puerto Rico manufacturing plant. Salaried employees at the plant were
            covered by the Hershey Foods Corporation Retirement Plan as of December 31,
            2000, for services subsequent to the date of acquisition.

            An unrecognized net actuarial loss for pension benefits in 2001,
            compared with the unrecognized net actuarial gain for pension benefits in 2000,
            was due primarily to the actual return on plan assets being less than the
            expected return and a lower discount rate in 2001.
          </P>
          <P>
            As of December 31, 2001, for pension plans with accumulated benefit
            obligations in excess of plan assets, the related projected benefit obligation,
            accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets were $794.3
            million, $750.9 million and $657.3 million, respectively. Included in the
            projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation amounts, were
            $41.6 million and $40.4 million, respectively, for an unfunded supplemental
            executive retirement program, which is a non-qualified plan that provides
            certain senior executive officers defined pension benefits based on their total
            compensation. As of December 31, 2000, for pension plans with accumulated
            benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the related projected benefit
            obligation and accumulated benefit obligation were $36.5 million and $34.9
            million, respectively, with no plan assets, primarily associated with the
            supplemental executive retirement program.

            A minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the
            actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits exceeds plan assets and
            accrued pension liabilities. In 2001, a minimum liability adjustment of $57.1
            million, net of a deferred tax benefit of $22.9 million, was recorded as a
            component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reported in accumulated
            other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity. In 2000, a
            minimum liability adjustment of $1.5 million, net of a deferred tax benefit of
            $.6 million, was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)
            and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of
            stockholders' equity.

            The Corporation has two post-retirement benefit plans. The health

            In conjunction with the business realignment initiatives announced
            on October 24, 2001, the Corporation offered an early retirement program to
            approximately 10% of its work force in the fourth quarter of 2001. The early
            retirement program gave eligible salaried employees an opportunity to retire
            with enhanced benefits related to the Corporation's pension and other
            post-retirement benefit plans. In general, eligible employees were born before
            January 1, 1954 and were hired before January 1, 1999. Pension benefits were
            enhanced by adding five additional years of age and service to eligible
            employees' retirement accounts, along with certain supplemental benefits.
            Retiree medical benefits were enhanced by adding five additional years to age
            and service formulas used to determine retiree contributions.
          </P>
          <P>
            The total pre-tax charge for the VWRP recorded in the fourth
            quarter was $148.7 million and was accrued based on actual employee
            acceptances. Improved pension benefits under the early retirement program of
            $109.1 million will be funded through payments from one of the Corporation's
            defined benefit pension plans. Enhanced retiree medical benefits of $30.8
            million will be funded from operating cash flows. Additional costs for
            outplacement services and enhanced severance benefits under a voluntary mutual
            separation program of $8.8 million will also be funded from operating cash
            flows. In addition, the Corporation expects to record a non-cash pre-tax charge
            of approximately $20.2 million in 2002, related to pension settlement costs
            associated with the early retirement program.

            TRUST </H3>
          <P>
            The Corporation's employee stock ownership trust ("ESOP") serves as
            the primary vehicle for contributions to its existing Employee Savings Stock
            Investment and Ownership Plan for participating domestic salaried and hourly
            employees. The ESOP was funded by a 15-year 7.75% loan of $47.9 million from
            the Corporation. During 2001 and 2000, the ESOP received a combination of
            dividends on unallocated shares and contributions from the Corporation equal to
            the amount required to meet its principal and interest payments under the loan.
            Simultaneously, the ESOP allocated to participants 159,176 shares of Common
            Stock each year. As of December 31, 2001, the ESOP held 1,139,966 allocated
            shares and 795,872 unallocated shares. All ESOP shares are considered
            outstanding for income per share computations.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Corporation recognized net compensation expense equal to the
            shares allocated multiplied by the original cost of $20.06 per share less
            dividends received by the ESOP on unallocated shares. Compensation expense
            related to the ESOP for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1.6 million, $3.2 million and
            $1.6 million, respectively. Dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares for 2001,
            2000 and 1999 were $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
            Dividends paid on all ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction to retained
            earnings. The unearned ESOP compensation balance in stockholders' equity
            represented deferred compensation expense to be recognized by the Corporation
            in future years as additional shares are allocated to participants.

            As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation had 530,000,000 authorized
            shares of capital stock. Of this total, 450,000,000 shares were designated as
            Common Stock, 75,000,000 shares as Class B Common Stock ("Class B Stock"), and
            5,000,000 shares as Preferred Stock, each class having a par value of one
            dollar per share. As of December 31, 2001, a combined total of 179,950,872
            shares of both classes of common stock had been issued of which 135,639,002
            shares were outstanding. No shares of the Preferred Stock were issued or
            outstanding during the three-year period ended December 31, 2001.

            Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote
            together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders,
            including the election of directors, with the Common Stock having one vote per
            share and the Class B Stock having ten votes per share. However, the Common
            Stock, voting separately as a class, is entitled to elect one-sixth of the
            Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, the Common Stock is
            entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class
            B Stock.
          </P>
          <P>
            Class B Stock can be converted into Common Stock on a
            share-for-share basis at any time. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, a total of 8,050
            shares, 2,050 shares and 4,000 shares, respectively, of Class B Stock were

            In December 2000, the Corporation's Board of Directors unanimously
            adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ("Rights Agreement") and
            declared a dividend of one right ("Right") for each outstanding share of Common
            Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of
            business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or
            receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not
            affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the
            manner in which the Corporation's Common Stock is traded.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Rights become exercisable only upon (i) resolution of the Board
            of Directors after any person has commenced a tender offer that would result in
            such person becoming the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Common Stock,
            (ii) the Corporation's announcement that a person or group has acquired 15% or
            more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (iii) a person or group
            becoming the beneficial owner of more than 35% of the voting power of all of
            the outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock. When exercisable, each Right
            entitles its registered holder to purchase from the Corporation, at a
            pre-determined exercise price, one one-thousandth of a share

            Common Stock or (b) such person or group acquiring more than 35% of the voting
            power of the Common Stock and Class B Stock, each Right (except those owned by
            the acquiring person or group) will automatically become a right to buy, at the
            pre-determined exercise price, that number of one one-thousandths of a share of
            Series A Participating Preferred Stock having a market value of twice the
            exercise price. In addition, if the Corporation is acquired in a merger or
            other business combination, each Right will entitle a holder to purchase from
            the acquiring company, for the pre-determined exercise price, preferred stock
            of the acquiring company having an aggregate market value equal to twice the
            exercise price.

            Further, at any time after a person or group acquires 15% or more
            (but less than 50%) of the Corporation's Common Stock or more than 35% of the
            voting power of all outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock, the
            Corporation's Board of Directors may, at its option, exchange all (but not less
            than all) of the outstanding Preferred Stock (other than Rights held by the
            acquiring person or group) for shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock, as
            applicable, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock or Class B Stock

            The Corporation, solely at its option, may amend the Rights or
            redeem the Rights for $.01 per Right at any time before the acquisition by a

            more than 35% of the voting power of all of the outstanding Common Stock and

            The long-term portion of the Key Employee Incentive Plan
            ("Incentive Plan"), provides for grants of stock-based compensation awards to
            senior executives and key employees of one or more of the following:
            non-qualified stock options ("fixed stock options"), performance stock units,
            stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units. The Incentive Plan also
            provides for the deferral of performance stock unit and restricted stock unit
            awards by participants. As of December 31, 2001, 13.0 million shares (inclusive
            of adjustments for stock splits) were authorized and approved by the
            Corporation's stockholders for grants under the long-term portion of the
            Incentive Plan. In 2002, the Corporation's Board of Directors amended the
            Incentive Plan to increase by 6.0 million the number of shares available for
            grants under the long-term portion of the Incentive Plan.

            In 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a

            Growth provides all eligible employees with a one-time grant of 100
            non-qualified stock options. Under HSY Growth, over 1.2 million options were

            The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
            grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
            weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
            respectively: dividend yields of 2.2%, 1.8% and 1.4%, expected volatility of
            28%, 27% and 23%, risk-free interest rates of 5.0%, 6.7% and 4.9%, and expected
            lives of 6.4 years, 6.5 years and 6.5 years.

            The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the
            Corporation's Common Stock on the date of grant. Each option has a maximum term
            of ten years. Options granted under the Incentive Plan prior to December 31,
            1999, vest at the end of the second year after grant. In 2000, the terms and
            conditions of the grant were changed to provide for pro-rated vesting over four
            years for options granted subsequent to December 31, 1999. Options granted
            under the HSY Growth program have a term of ten years and vested on January 7,

            added and free cash flow are met, the full number of shares are awarded to the

            In the normal course of business, the Corporation extends credit to
            customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. The Corporation believes
            that it has little concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of its
            customer base. As of December 31, 2001, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries
            accounted for approximately 15% of the Corporation's total accounts receivable.
            As of December 31, 2001, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of the
            Corporation's total accounts receivable. Receivables, as shown on the
            Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts
            of $16.0 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

            of first-in, first-out ("FIFO") cost or market. Inventories include material,
            labor and overhead. LIFO cost of inventories valued using the LIFO method was
            $351.1 million and $456.7 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
            respectively, and inventories were stated at amounts that did not exceed
            realizable values. Raw materials, principally cocoa beans and cocoa butter,

            Hedging transactions were associated with exchange traded futures
            contracts entered into to manage price risks related to the purchase of raw
            materials and energy for manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation
            costs. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001, the
            impact of hedging transactions was reclassified to accumulated other
            comprehensive loss.

            Hershey Foods Corporation is responsible for the financial
            statements and other financial information contained in this report. The
            Corporation believes that the financial statements have been prepared in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
            appropriate under the circumstances to reflect in all material respects the
            substance of applicable events and transactions. In preparing the financial
            statements, it is necessary that management make informed estimates and
            judgments. The other financial information in this annual report is consistent
            with the financial statements.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls
            designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are reliable
            for purposes of preparing financial statements and that assets are properly
            accounted for and safeguarded. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on
            the recognition that the cost of the system must be related to the benefits to
            be derived. The Corporation believes its system provides an appropriate balance
            in this regard. The Corporation maintains an Internal Audit Department which
            reviews the adequacy and tests the application of internal accounting controls.

          </P>
          <P>
            The financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP,
            independent public accountants, whose appointment was ratified by stockholder
            vote at the stockholders' meeting held on April 24, 2001. Their report
            expresses an opinion that the Corporation's financial statements are fairly
            stated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
            United States, and they have indicated to us that their audit was performed in
            accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
            which are designed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
            statements are free of material misstatement.
          </P>
          <P>
            The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
            consisting solely of non-management directors, meets regularly with the
            independent public accountants, internal auditors and management to discuss,
            among other things, the audit scopes and results. Arthur Andersen LLP and the
            internal auditors both have full and free access to the Audit Committee, with
            and without the presence of management.

            To the Stockholders and Board of Directors<BR>of Hershey Foods
            Corporation:
          </P>
          <P>
            We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
            Hershey Foods Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of
            December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income,
            cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period
            ended December 31, 2001, appearing on pages A-16 through A-43. These financial
            statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
            responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
            our audits.
          </P>
          <P>
            We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
            generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
            financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
            examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
            the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
            principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
            evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
            audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
          </P>
          <P>
            In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
            fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hershey Foods
            Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results
            of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
            period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
            generally accepted in the United States.

                           DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

                  (AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2001)

                  This Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") allows
participants in the following programs of Hershey Foods Corporation's Key
Employee Incentive Plan to defer receipt of all or part of their awards: (1)
cash awards under the Annual Incentive Program (the "AIP"); (2) the cash
equivalent or Common Stock of Hershey Foods Corporation (the "Company")
representing performance stock unit ("PSU") awards under the Long Term Incentive
Program ("LTIP"); and (3) awards of Common Stock of the Company pursuant to
Restricted Stock Unit ("RSU") awards under the LTIP granted on or after January
1, 2001. The Plan is intended to benefit those key executives of Hershey Foods
Corporation and subsidiaries as specified in the AIP and LTIP who participate in
the AIP or LTIP, to secure their goodwill, loyalty and achievement, and to help
attract and retain highly qualified executives.

                  The Compensation and Executive Organization Committee of the
Company's Board of Directors has established certain minimum stockholding
requirements for employees who are eligible to receive awards under the LTIP.
The Committee may, in its discretion, allow credit towards such requirement for
Company Common Stock constructively invested by such employee pursuant to a
vested PSU or vested RSU deferred under this Plan. Dividends previously earned,
as well as future dividends earned on deferred PSU awards and deferred RSU
awards, are eligible for deferral under the Plan.

                          DEFERRAL ELECTIONS: ACCOUNTS

        2.1   Election to Defer.
              -----------------

                 a. AIP Awards.  A Participant  may elect under the Plan to
                    ----------
defer receipt of all or a portion of his or her anticipated bonus under the AIP.
A Participant's election must be made no later than November 1st of the Plan
Year in which the Participant renders the services which may result in the AIP
bonus award.

                b. PSU Awards. A Participant may elect under the Plan to defer
                   ----------
receipt of all or a portion of the cash or Company Common Stock amount earned as
a PSU award under the LTIP, provided that, unless the Committee has determined
otherwise, an election to defer a cash PSU award under this Plan can only be
made if the Participant has satisfied the minimum stockholding requirements
established by the Board of Directors. A Participant's election to defer a PSU
award, whether in cash or Company Common Stock, must be made at least sixty (60)
days prior to the date the PSU award will be paid or, if earlier, by the
December 31 preceding the date such PSU award will be paid.

                c. RSU Awards. A Participant may elect under the Plan to defer
                   ----------
receipt of all or a portion of the amount earned as an RSU award under the LTIP.
A Participant's election must be made at least sixty (60) days prior to the date
the RSU award will be paid or, if earlier, by the December 31 immediately
preceding the date such RSU award will be paid.

                d. Any deferral election under this Section 2.1 shall be made on
a form supplied by the Plan Administrator. The election to defer an AIP bonus, a
PSU award or an RSU award is irrevocable except as specifically provided
otherwise in this Plan.

        2.2   Accounts.
              --------

                a.  Establishment  of Accounts.  Any amounts deferred by a
                    --------------------------
Participant will not  be funded or set aside for future  payment by the Company.
Instead,  an Account will be noted for the Participant on the Company's books. A
Participant's Account will be credited with amounts deferred and with investment
credits  as  provided  in  paragraph  c.  below.  A  separate  Account  will  be
established for each Deferral Election.

                b. Participants as Unsecured Creditors. A Participant's
                   -----------------------------------
entitlement to receive the amount reflected by his or her Accounts will be based
solely on an unfunded unsecured unconditional promise to pay by the Company that
is not assignable; however, except as provided in Section 7.5 below or under the
terms of a Participant's  RSU award,  the Participant at all times will be fully
vested in the Accounts.

                c. Investment Credits to Accounts. Subject to such limitations
                   ------------------------------
as may from time to time be required by law,  imposed by the Plan  Administrator
or as set forth in paragraph (6) below,  and subject to such operating rules and
procedures as may be imposed from

                                        3
<PAGE>


time to time by the Plan Administrator, each Participant may express to the Plan
Administrator a preference as to how the Participant's Accounts should be
constructively invested among the Investment Options. Such preference shall
designate the percentage of the Participant's Accounts which is requested to be
constructively invested in each Investment Option.

                    (1) Any initial or subsequent expression of investment
preference shall be in writing, on a form supplied by and filed with the Plan
Administrator. Participants may change their investment preferences effective as
of the beginning of each Plan Year, or more frequently if permitted in the
discretion of the Plan Administrator.

                    (2) All investment preferences shall be advisory only and
shall not bind the Company or the Plan Administrator. The Company shall not be
obligated to invest any funds in connection with this Plan. If, however, the
Company chooses to invest any amount to provide for its liabilities under this
Plan, the Plan Administrator shall have complete discretion as to investments,
and no Participant shall have any claim on such investments as a fund to provide
benefits hereunder.

                    (3) From time to time, but not less frequently than each
Determination Date, the Plan Administrator shall allocate the net earnings or
losses of the Plan since the preceding Determination Date among the Accounts of
Participants, and to the extent a Participant's Investment Option preferences
are honored by the Plan Administrator, such net earnings or losses shall be
allocated as though the Accounts had been invested in the Investment Option in
accordance with the Participant's indicated preference. The "net earnings or
losses" of the Plan shall be equal to the net increase or net decrease (taking
into account any constructive dividends or interest thereon), as the case may
be, in the value of a Participant's Accounts since the last Determination Date
in accordance with the Participant's investment preferences or other such
allocation of such net increase or net decrease in the value of funds
constructively invested by the Plan Administrator and allocated to the Accounts
of Participants hereunder.

                    (4) If the Plan Administrator receives an initial or revised
investment preference which it deems to be incomplete, unclear or improper, the
Participant's investment preference then in effect shall remain in effect (or,
in the case of a deficiency in an initial investment preference, the Participant
shall be deemed to have filed no investment preference) until the beginning of
the next Plan Year, unless the Plan Administrator provides for, and permits the
application of, corrective action prior thereto. If a Participant fails to file
an effective investment preference, the Participant's Accounts will be
constructively invested in the American Express Cash Management Fund (or such
Investment Option designated by the Plan Administrator from time to time as a
substitute for such Fund).

                    (5) If the Plan Administrator determines that the
constructive value of an Account as of any date on which distributions are to be
made differs materially from the constructive value of the Account on the prior
Determination Date upon which the distribution is to be based, the Plan
Administrator, in its discretion, shall have the right to designate any date in
the interim as a Determination Date for the purpose of constructively revaluing
the Account so that the Account from which the distribution is being made will,
prior to the distribution, reflect its share of such material difference in
value. Similarly, the Plan Administrator may adopt a


                                        4
<PAGE>


policy of providing for regular interim valuations without regard to the
materiality of changes in the value of the Accounts.

                    (6) The foregoing provisions of this paragraph 2.2c to the
contrary notwithstanding: (i) that portion of all deferred PSUs that is payable
in Company Common Stock under the LTIP and all deferred RSUs shall be
constructively invested in Company Common Stock; (ii) the Participant's Accounts
shall be credited from time to time with the amount of any dividends declared
and paid on such Company Common Stock, and shall be adjusted in connection with
any stock dividend, split, reorganization, liquidation or other event which
affects the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such PSUs and RSUs;
and (iii) no other amounts deferred under this Plan shall be constructively
invested in Company Common Stock.

             d. Statement  of Accounts.  Within a reasonable time after the end
                ----------------------
 of each Plan Year, the Plan Administrator shall submit to each Participant a
 statement of the balance in his Accounts.

        2.3   Credit of Pre-1995 AIP Deferrals to Accounts. Participants who
              --------------------------------------------
previously deferred AIP awards under the deferral arrangements in effect for
awards prior to 1995 may elect as of any beginning of any Plan Year to credit
any portion of their deferral accounts under the prior arrangement to their
Accounts under this Plan. Credits shall be made to this Plan pursuant to this
Section on January 1 of the Plan Year subsequent to any such election being
made. Amounts so credited shall become part of a Participant's Accounts and
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, except that prior
elections as to payment of deferred amounts shall remain in effect. Once amounts
are credited to a Participant's Accounts pursuant to this Section 2.3, they may
not thereafter be returned to the Participant's deferral accounts under the
prior deferral arrangement.

        2.4   Credit of Pre-1995 Dividends Paid on PSU Deferrals to Accounts.
              --------------------------------------------------------------
Participants who previously received dividends on deferred PSU awards under the
deferral arrangements in effect for awards prior to 1995 may elect as of the
beginning of any Plan Year to credit any portion of their previously deferred
dividends under the prior arrangement to their Accounts under this Plan.
Notwithstanding the above, previously deferred PSU dividends are not eligible to
be deferred pursuant to the terms of the Plan unless the Participant has
satisfied the employee minimum stockholding requirements established by the
Committee. Credits shall be made to this Plan pursuant to this Section on the
January 1 of the Plan Year subsequent to any such election being made. Amounts
so credited shall become part of a Participant's Accounts and shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Plan, except that prior elections as to
payment of deferred amounts shall remain in effect. Once amounts are credited to
a Participant's Accounts pursuant to this Section 2.4, they may not thereafter
be returned to the Participant's deferral accounts under the prior deferral
arrangement.

                            DISTRIBUTION OF DEFERRALS

        3.1   Initial Election of Distribution Options in Deferral Election.
              -------------------------------------------------------------

             a. A Participant must specify in each of his or her Deferral
Elections when such Account will be distributed. Distribution may be made or
begin in any future Plan Year or Years, but distributions must begin not later
than the Plan Year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains
age 70. The Participant may elect to receive amounts deferred in a lump sum or
in up to ten substantially equal annual installments. A Participant may specify
different distribution dates and forms of payment under each of his or her
Deferral Elections. All amounts of a Participant's Accounts constructively
invested in Company Common Stock shall be distributed in the form of Company
Common Stock. All other amounts shall be distributed in cash.

             b. Any provision of this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, all
distributions hereunder shall be deferred until such time, in the discretion of
the Committee, as such distribution would not be disallowed as a deduction under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

        3.2   Changes in Distribution Options.
              -------------------------------

             a. A Participant is entitled to one future opportunity to further
lengthen (not shorten) the deferral period provided in a Deferral Election and
to make one future change with regard to lengthening (not shortening) the
payment schedule provided in that Deferral Election up to a maximum payment
schedule of ten years.

             b. Any change in the deferral period or the payment schedule must
be submitted to the Plan  Administrator  in writing,  on a form  provided by the
Plan  Administrator,  at least twelve months, or such shorter period as the Plan
Administrator may accept, but in no event later than the December 31, before the
date  payments  were  originally  scheduled to begin.  No change in the deferral
period shall be permitted if such change would cause payments to begin after the
Plan Year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70.

        3.3   Payment of Deferred Amounts.
              ---------------------------

             a. Upon the date elected by the Participant, the Company shall
begin to pay to the  Participant  an  amount  equal  to the  total  amount  then
credited to the Participant's  Accounts. Such amount is to be paid either in one
lump sum or in substantially equal annual installments over a period of years as
previously  elected by the Participant,  which period shall be not more than ten
years. Each annual installment shall include investment credits on the remaining
balance during the previous Plan Year until the Accounts shall have been paid in
full. A Participant may continue to express  investment  preferences as provided
in  paragraph  c of  Section  2.2  during  the  period  that an Account is being
distributed.

             b. If the Participant dies before payment in full of the amount
standing to the Participant's credit in the Accounts, the unpaid balance may be
paid in one lump sum or in substantially equal installments to the Participant's
beneficiary over the remaining distribution



                                        6
<PAGE>

period elected by the Participant.  If the Participant dies before the beginning
date  of the  deferred  payment  and did  not  indicate  a  specific  method  of
distribution,  then the  Participant's  designated  beneficiary may petition the
Plan  Administrator  regarding the method of  distribution.  In the absence of a
designated  beneficiary,  the balance of the Accounts will be paid in a lump sum
to the estate of the Participant as soon as possible.

             c. If the Participant's employment is terminated for any reason
other than Retirement, death or Disability before the elected payment date, then
the Company,  acting  through the Plan  Administrator,  at its  discretion,  but
subject  to any  limitations  set  forth  in the  Company's  Executive  Benefits
Protection  Plan (or any similar or successor plan or program) or any employment
agreement  to  which  the  Participant  is a party  or is  covered,  at any time
thereafter may:

                    (1) Immediately pay over any amounts credited to the
Participant's Accounts to the Participant.

                    (2) Deposit any amounts credited to the Participant's
Accounts in a grantor trust for the Company's benefit who will manage and pay
over such amounts to the Participant in accordance with the terms of this Plan,
with administrative costs in such event being charged to the Participant's
Accounts.

                    (3) Continue to itself maintain and pay over amounts
deferred to the  Participant  in accordance  with the terms of this Plan and the
Participant's election pursuant thereto.

             d. If both the Participant and his beneficiary die after payments
to the Participant begin and before all payments are made from the Participant's
Accounts, the remaining value of the Accounts shall be determined as of the date
of death of the  beneficiary or  Participant,  whichever is later,  and shall be
paid as promptly  as  possible in one lump sum to the estate of the  survivor of
the Participant and such beneficiary.

             e. A Participant may designate or change his or her beneficiary
(without the consent of any prior beneficiary) on a form provided by the Plan
Administrator and delivered to the Plan Administrator before the Participant's
death.

             f. Subject to Section 3.1: (1) if a Participant elects to receive
amounts deferred in a lump sum or in annual installments on a date prior to
Retirement, such payments will commence or payment will be made in the month of
January of the Plan Year selected by the Participant; (2) if the Participant
elects to receive amounts deferred in a lump sum (other than amounts deferred as
Common Stock for payment in a lump sum) or in annual installments after
Retirement, such payments shall commence or payment shall be made in the month
of January of the Plan Year following the calendar year in which the Participant
retires; and (3) if a Participant elects to receive amounts deferred as Common
Stock in a lump-sum after Retirement, such payment will be made in the month of
January of the Plan Year following the calendar year in which the Participant
retires, unless an earlier date is approved by the Plan Administrator upon
application by the Participant.

        3.4   Hardship Distributions. The Compensation Committee may, in its
              ----------------------
discretion, accelerate payments to a Participant in an amount up to the AIP
bonus or the cash portion of a PSU award previously deferred, together with
investment credits to date, in the event of demonstrated severe financial
hardship. Any such payments made will be limited to the amount needed to meet
the demonstrated financial need. A Participant seeking a financial hardship
withdrawal from his or her Accounts must request a hearing with the Plan
Administrator, who will gather facts and render a report to the Compensation
Committee for a decision.

        3.5   Other Withdrawals:Forfeiture Penalty.  A Participant may, by
              ------------------------------------
written request on a form provided by the Plan Administrator, withdraw all or
any portion of any of his Accounts as of any Determination Date, provided that
the Participant shall forfeit 10% of the amount withdrawn as a penalty.

        3.6   Withholding. Any payments made pursuant to this Article III shall
              -----------
be subject to appropriate federal, state or local income tax withholdings. Any
withholdings required in respect of a distribution of Company Common Stock shall
be deducted from other cash amounts then distributed hereunder or, if none, from
other cash compensation payable to Participant. If no other cash compensation is
then payable to the Participant then, in the discretion of the Committee, such
distribution of Company Common Stock shall be deferred until such time as (a)
such cash distribution or other compensation is payable to the Participant that
can be withheld hereunder, or (b) the Participant deposits with the Company such
amount of cash and/or directs the Company to withhold from such distribution
such number of shares of Company Common Stock having a fair market value (as
defined in the LTIP) equal to the amount required to satisfy such withholding
tax obligation.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                CLAIMS PROCEDURE

        4.1   The following provisions are incorporated in the Plan in
accordance with the requirements of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974:

             a.  The following claims procedure is hereby established:

                (1) A Participant or beneficiary shall make a claim for the
benefits provided hereunder by delivering a written request to the Plan
Administrator. Upon receipt of a claim, the Plan Administrator shall determine
whether to grant the claim, deny it, or grant it in part.

                (2) If a claim is wholly or partially denied, notice of the
decision, meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) following shall be furnished
to the claimant within a reasonable period of time after receipt of a claim by
the Plan Administrator.

                (3) The Plan Administrator shall provide to every claimant who
is denied a claim for benefits, written notice setting forth in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant, the specific reason or reasons for
the denial; specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which denial is
based; a description of any additional material or information necessary for the
claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or


                                        8
<PAGE>

information  is  necessary;  and an  explanation  of  the  Plan's  claim  review
procedure as set forth herein.

                (4) The purpose of the review procedures set forth herein is to
provide a procedure by which a claimant under the Plan may have a reasonable
opportunity to appeal a denial of a claim to the named fiduciary for a full and
fair review. To accomplish that purpose, the claimant or his duly authorized
representative may request a review upon written application to the Committee;
may review pertinent Plan documents; and may submit issues and comments in
writing. A claimant (or his duly authorized representative) shall request a
review by filing a written application for review with the Plan Administrator at
any time within sixty (60) days after receipt by the claimant of written notice
of denial of this claim.

                (5) The decision on review of a denied claim shall be made as
follows. The decision on review shall be made by the Plan Administrator, which
may in its discretion hold a hearing on the denied claim. The Plan Administrator
shall make a decision promptly, and not later than sixty (60) days after receipt
of the request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to
hold a hearing) require an extension of time , in which case a decision shall be
rendered as soon as possible, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after receipt of the request for review. The decision on review shall be in
writing and shall include specific reasons for the decisions, written in the
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, and specific references to
the pertinent Plan revisions on which the decision is based. The Plan
Administrator shall have full discretion to decide the claim and its decision on
review shall be final and binding on all parties.

             b. For the sole purpose of implementing the claims procedure (and
not for any other purposes), the Plan Administrator is hereby designated as a
named fiduciary of this Plan.

                               PLAN ADMINISTRATOR

        5.1   Plan Administrator Duties. The Plan Administrator shall administer
              -------------------------
this Plan. All members of the committee comprising the Plan Administrator may be
Participants. A member of the committee comprising the Plan Administrator who is
a Participant may not vote on matters affecting his or her personal benefit
under this Plan, but any such individual shall otherwise be fully entitled to
act in matters arising out of or affecting this Plan notwithstanding his or her
participation herein. The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to make,
amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the
administration of this Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions,
including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in connection with the
Plan.

        5.2   Agents. In the administration of this Plan, the Plan Administrator
              -----
may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them or to others

The Plan Administrator may from time to time consult with counsel, who may be
counsel to the Company.

        5.3   Binding Effect of Decisions. In carrying out its duties herein,
              ---------------------------
the Plan Administrator (or its designee) shall have full discretion to exercise
all powers and to make all determinations, consistent with the terms of the
Plan, in all matters entrusted to it, and its determinations shall be final and
binding on all parties.

        5.4   Indemnity. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Plan
              ---------
Administrator and any employees to whom administrative duties under this Plan

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

        6.1   Amendment. The Committee may at any time amend the Plan in whole
              ---------
or in part. However, no amendment shall be effective to decrease or restrict any
then  existing  Account or to change the  Company's  obligations  under any then
existing  Deferral  Election or as  otherwise  may be  provided in an  agreement
entered into between the Company and the  Participant  prior to the date of such
Deferral Election or the Company's  Executive  Benefits  Protection Plan (or any
similar or successor plan or program).

        6.2   Board's Right to Terminate. The Board may at any time terminate
              --------------------------
the Plan in its  entirety,  in which event no new  Deferral  Elections  shall be
made, but the obligations of the Company under existing Deferral Elections shall
continue.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        7.1   Unfunded Plan. This Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan
              -------------
maintained primarily to provide deferred compensation for a "select group of
management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and shall be so construed.

        7.2   Unsecured General Creditor. This Plan is unfunded. Benefits shall
              --------------------------
be paid from the Company's general assets. Participants and their beneficiaries,
heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interest
or claims in any property or assets owned or which may be acquired by the
Company. Such assets of the Company shall not be held under any trust for the
benefit of Participants, their beneficiaries, heirs, successors or assigns, or
held in any way as collateral security against the obligations of the Company
under this Plan. The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be that of an
unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to pay money in the future. The
Company in its sole discretion, may, however, elect to provide for its
liabilities under this Plan through a trust or funding vehicle, provided,
however, that the terms of any such trust or funding vehicle shall not alter the
status of Participants and beneficiaries as mere general unsecured creditors of
the Company or otherwise cause the Plan to be funded or benefits taxable to
Participants except upon actual receipt.

        7.3   Nonassignability. Neither a Participant nor any other person shall
              ----------------
have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage,
or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, or convey in advance of actual
receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or


                                       10
<PAGE>


any part thereof. The rights to all such amounts are expressly declared to be
unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior
to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any
debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance owed by Participants or any
other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a
Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency, except as required
by law.

        7.4   Not a Contract of Employment. The terms and conditions of this
              ----------------------------
Plan shall not be deemed to  constitute  a contract  of  employment  between the
Company and a  Participant,  and a Participant  shall have no rights against the
Company  except as may  otherwise be  specifically  provided  herein.  Moreover,

provisions of this Section 7.4 to the contrary notwithstanding,  this Plan shall
not diminish  any rights or increase any  obligations  of a  Participant  or the
Company under any employment  agreement  entered into by the Participant and the
Company prior to such Participant's  Deferral  Election,  or after such Deferral
Election to the extent that such employment agreement specifically provides that
it shall supersede any inconsistency with the terms of this Plan.

        7.5   Forfeiture of Benefits. If a Participant's employment is
              ----------------------
terminated because of willful misfeasance or gross negligence in the performance
of his or her duties, his or her right to benefits under this Plan shall, in the
discretion of the Committee, be forfeited, and the Company shall have no further
obligation hereunder to such Participant or his or her beneficiary(ies).

              --------------
United States and, to the extent not preempted thereby,the laws of Pennsylvania.

        7.9   Validity. The illegality or invalidity of any provision of this
              --------

                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                          DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION PLAN

                  (Amended and Restated as of October 2, 2001)


                                        1

                                     PURPOSE

       The purposes of the Directors' Compensation Plan ("Plan") are to provide
Directors of Hershey Foods Corporation ("Corporation") with payment alternatives
for the retainer and fees payable for services as members of the Board of
Directors ("Board") of the Corporation or as a chair of any committee thereof
(together, "Director Fees"), to provide Directors the opportunity to elect to
receive all or a portion of the retainer in Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs"), each
representing an obligation of the Corporation to issue one share of Common Stock
of the Corporation, $1.00 par value per share ("Common Stock"), and to promote
the identification of interests between such Directors and the stockholders of
the Corporation by paying a portion of each Director's compensation in
Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), each RSU representing an obligation of the
Corporation to issue one share of Common Stock.


                                        2

                                   ELIGIBILITY

       Any Director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Except
as the context may otherwise require, references in this Plan to a "Director"
shall mean only those directors of the Company who are participants in the Plan.


                                        3

                                     PAYMENT

       (a) DIRECTOR FEES. A Director shall be entitled to Director Fees, in such
amounts as shall be determined by the Board, for services on the Board and as a
chair of any committee of the Board. Directors may elect to have all or any
portion of the cash retainer paid in shares of Common Stock. Fees payable for
services as a chair of any committee of the Board shall be payable currently
only in cash. Any shares of Common Stock payable under this Section 3(a) shall
be paid by the issuance to the Director of a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the cash amount of the retainer so payable divided by the Fair Market
Value of one share of the Common Stock, as defined in Section 12 hereof. Any
fractional share of Common Stock resulting from such payment shall be rounded to
the nearest whole share. The Corporation shall issue share certificates to the
Director for the shares of Common Stock acquired or, if requested

<PAGE>

in writing by the Director and permitted  under such plan,  the shares  acquired
shall be added to the  Director's  account  under  the  Corporation's  Automatic
Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan.  As of the date on which  the part or whole of the
retainer  is  payable  in  shares  of  Common  Stock,  the  Director  shall be a
stockholder of the  Corporation  with respect to such shares.  Unless  otherwise
elected in Section 4, any remaining Director Fees shall be payable in cash.

       (b) RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. A Director shall also be entitled to receive
RSUs, in such amounts as shall be determined by the Board, for services on the
Board. Beginning October 1, 2001 and thereafter, unless otherwise directed by
the Board, RSUs having a value of $10,000 (or such other amount as the Board
shall from time to time determine) shall be awarded to each Director on the
first day of October, January, April, and July. The number of full and
fractional RSUs so awarded shall be determined by dividing $10,000 (or such
other amount) by the average of the per share closing price of the Common Stock
on the New York Stock Exchange as published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (or such
other reliable publication as the Board or its delegates may determine) for the
last three trading days of the month preceding the date of the award. Directors
whose membership on the Board commences after October 1, 2001 on a day which is
not the first day of any January, April, July or October, shall be awarded a pro
rata number of RSU's with respect to the quarter during which the Director
joined the Board equal to the number of RSUs awarded to each Director who was a
member of the Board on the first day of the applicable quarter, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of days remaining in the
quarter after the first day on which such Director became a member of the Board,
and the denominator being the total number of days in the quarter. A Restricted
Stock Unit Account shall be established on the books of the Corporation in the
name of each Director. During the period of the Director's membership on the
Board, the Director's Restricted Stock Unit Account shall be subject to credits,
adjustment and substitution to reflect any dividend or other distribution on the
outstanding Common Stock or any split or consolidation or other change affecting
the Common Stock. Any such credit, adjustment or substitution shall be made in a
manner similar to that set forth in Section 6(a) and 6(b) with respect to
Deferred Stock Compensation Accounts. RSUs awarded pursuant to the Plan shall
vest upon termination of the Director's membership on the Board by reason of
retirement, death or disability, or such other circumstances as the Board, in
its sole discretion shall at any time determine. RSUs not vested upon or in
connection with the Director's termination of membership on the Board, as
aforesaid, shall be forfeited as of the date of such termination. The balance of
the Director's Restricted Stock Unit Account which becomes vested shall be paid
in a lump sum in accordance with Section 7. If payment hereunder would result in
the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall
not be issued and cash in lieu of such fractional share shall be paid to the
Director based upon the average of the per share closing price of the Common
Stock in the New York Stock Exchange as published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (or
such other reliable publication as the Board or its delegates may determine) for
the three trading days immediately preceding the date of payment. The
Corporation shall issue share certificates to the Director, or the Director's
designated beneficiary, for the shares of Common Stock represented by the
Director's vested RSUs, or if requested in writing by the Director and permitted
under such plan, the shares to be distributed shall be added to the Director's
account under the Corporation's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan. As of the
date on which the Director is entitled to receive payment of shares of Common
Stock, a Director shall be a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to such
shares.

                                    ELECTIONS

       (a) DIRECTOR FEE PAYMENT  ALTERNATIVES.  A Director may elect any one of
the following alternatives with respect to payment of Director Fees:

               (1) to receive currently full payment in cash and/or Common
       Stock, as set forth in Section 3(a) above, on the date or dates on which
       the Director Fees are payable;

               (2) to defer  payment  of all or a portion  of the Director  Fees
       for subsequent  payment  in cash (a "Cash  Deferral Election");


               (3) to defer payment of all or a portion of the Director Fees for
       subsequent payment in shares of Common Stock (a "Stock Deferral
       Election"); or

               (4)   a combination of (2) and (3).

       (b) FILING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ELECTIONS. The election by a Director to
receive payment of Director Fees other than as set forth in Section 4(a)(1) on
the date on which the Director Fees are otherwise payable is made by filing with
the Secretary of the Corporation a Notice of Election in the form prescribed by
the Corporation (an "Election"). In order to be effective for any calendar year,
an Election must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation on or before
December 31 of the preceding calendar year, except that if a Director files a
Notice of Election on or before 30 days subsequent to the Director's initial
election to the office of Director, the Election shall be effective on the date
of filing with respect to Director Fees payable for any portion of the calendar
year which remains at the date of such filing. An Election may not be modified
or terminated after the beginning of a calendar year for which it is effective.
Unless modified or terminated by filing a new Notice of Election on or before
December 31 immediately preceding the calendar year for which such modification
or termination is effective, an Election shall be effective for and apply to
Director Fees payable for each subsequent calendar year. Director Fees earned at
any time for which an Election is not effective shall be paid as set forth in
Section 4(a)(1) on the date when the Director Fees are otherwise payable. Any
Election shall terminate on the date a Director ceases to be a member of the
Board.

       (c) CASH  DEFERRAL  ELECTIONS.  Director  Fees  deferred  pursuant to a
Cash Deferral  Election shall be deferred and paid as provided in Sections 5 and
7.

       (d) STOCK  DEFERRAL  ELECTIONS.  Director  Fees deferred  pursuant to a
Stock Deferral Election shall be deferred and paid as provided in Sections 6 and
7.


                                       3

                                        5

                       DEFERRED CASH COMPENSATION ACCOUNT

       (a) GENERAL. The amount of any Director Fees deferred in accordance with
a Cash Deferral Election shall be credited on the date on which such Director
Fees are otherwise payable to a deferred cash compensation account maintained by
the Corporation in the name of the Director (a "Deferred Cash Compensation
Account"). A separate Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall be maintained for
each calendar year for which a Director has elected a different number of
payment installments or as otherwise may be agreed between the Director and the
Corporation.

       (b) ADJUSTMENT FOR EARNINGS OR LOSSES. The amount in the Director's
Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall be adjusted to reflect net earnings,
gains or losses in accordance with the provisions of the Hershey Foods
Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan relating to Investment Credits and
Investment Options. The adjustment for earnings, gains or losses shall be equal
to the amount determined under (1) below as follows:

               (1) DEEMED INVESTMENT OPTIONS. The total amount determined by
       multiplying the rate earned (positive or negative) by each fund available
       (taking into account earnings distributed and share appreciation (gains)
       or depreciation (losses) on the value of shares of the fund) for the
       applicable period by the portion of the balance in the Director's
       Deferred Cash Compensation Account as of the end of each such period,
       respectively, which is deemed to be invested in such fund pursuant to
       paragraph (2) below. Subject to elimination, modification or addition by
       the Board, the funds available for the Director's election of deemed
       investments pursuant to paragraph (2) below shall be the funds available
       (excluding Common Stock) under the Investment Options of the Hershey
       Foods Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan.

               (2)  DEEMED INVESTMENT ELECTIONS.

                     (A) The Director shall designate, on a form prescribed by
               the Corporation, the percentage of the deferred Director Fees
               that are to be deemed to be invested in the available funds under
               paragraph (1) above. Said designation shall be effective on a
               date specified by the Board and remain in effect and apply to all
               subsequent deferred Director Fees until changed as provided
               below.

                     (B) A Director may elect to change, on a calendar year
               basis (or on such other basis as permitted from time to time by
               the Board), the deemed investment election under paragraph (A)
               above with respect to future deferred Director Fees among one or
               more of the options then available by written notice to the
               Secretary of the Corporation, on a form prescribed by the
               Corporation (or by voice or other form of notice permitted by the
               Corporation), at least 10 days before the first day of the
               calendar year for which the change is to be effective, with such
               change to be effective for Director Fees credited to the Deferred
               Cash Compensation Account on and after the effective date of the
               change.


                                       4
<PAGE>

                     (C) A Director may elect to reallocate the balance of his
               Deferred Cash Compensation Account, subject to limitations
               imposed by the Board, on a calendar year basis, among the deemed
               investment options then available. A Director may make such an
               election by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation,
               on a form prescribed by the Corporation (or by voice or other
               form of notice permitted by the Corporation), at least 10 days
               before the first day of the calendar year for which the transfer
               election is to be effective, with such transfer to be based on
               the value of the Deferred Cash Compensation Account on the last
               day of the calendar year preceding the effective date of the
               transfer election.

                     (D) The election of deemed investments among the options
               provided above shall be the sole responsibility of each Director.
               The Corporation and Board members are not authorized to make any
               recommendation to any Director with respect to such election.
               Each Director assumes all risk connected with any adjustment to
               the value of his Deferred Cash Compensation Account. Neither the
               Board nor the Corporation in any way guarantees against loss or
               depreciation.

                     (E) All payments from the Plan shall be made pro-rata from
               the portion of the Director's Deferred Cash Compensation Account
               which is deemed to be invested in such funds as may be available
               from time to time for deemed investment elections under the Plan.

                     (F) The Corporation shall not be required or obligated to
               invest any amounts in the funds provided as deemed investment
               options, and such funds shall be used solely to measure
               investment performance. Further, the Corporation shall not be
               precluded from providing for its liabilities hereunder by
               investing in such funds or in any other investments deemed to be
               appropriate by the Board.

       (c) MANNER OF PAYMENT. The balance of a Director's Deferred Cash
Compensation Account will be paid to the Director or, in the event of the
Director's death, to the Director's designated beneficiary, in accordance with
the Cash Deferral Election. A Director may elect at the time of filing the
Notice of Election for a Cash Deferral Election to receive payment of the
Director Fees in annual installments rather than a lump sum, provided that the
payment period for installment payments shall not exceed ten years following the
Payment Commencement Date, as described in Section 7 hereof. The amount of any
installment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the balance in the Director's
Deferred Cash Compensation Account on the date of such installment by (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the
number of remaining unpaid installments (including the installment payment then
being determined). The balance of the Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall
be appropriately reduced on the date of payment to the Director or the
Director's designated beneficiary to reflect the installment payment made
hereunder. Amounts held pending distribution pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall
continue to be credited with the earnings, gains or losses as described in
Section 5(b) hereof.


                                       5

                                        6

                       DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION ACCOUNT

       (a) GENERAL. The amount of any Director Fees deferred in accordance with
a Stock Deferral Election shall be credited to a deferred stock compensation
account maintained by the Corporation in the name of the Director (a "Deferred
Stock Compensation Account"). A separate Deferred Stock Compensation Account
shall be maintained for each calendar year for which a Director has elected a
different number of payment installments or as otherwise determined by the
Board. On each date on which Director Fees are otherwise payable and a Stock
Deferral Election is effective for a Director, the Director's Deferred Stock
Compensation Account for that calendar year shall be credited with a number of
full and fractional Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") equal to the cash amount of
the Director Fees payable divided by the Fair Market Value of one share of the
Common Stock, as defined in Section 12 hereof, on the date on which such
Director Fees are payable. If a dividend or distribution is paid on the Common
Stock in cash or property other than Common Stock, on the date of payment of the
dividend or distribution to holders of the Common Stock each Deferred Stock
Compensation Account shall be credited with a number of full and fractional DSUs
equal to the number of full and fractional DSUs credited to such Account on the
date fixed for determining the stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or
distribution times the amount of the dividend or distribution paid per share of
Common Stock divided by the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, as
defined in Section 12 hereof, on the date on which the dividend or distribution
is paid. If the dividend or distribution is paid in property, the amount of the
dividend or distribution shall equal the fair market value of the property on
the date on which the dividend or distribution is paid. The Deferred Stock
Compensation Account of a Director shall be charged on the date of distribution
with any distribution of shares of Common Stock made to the Director from such
Account pursuant to Section 6(c) hereof.

       (b) ADJUSTMENT AND SUBSTITUTION. The number of DSUs credited to each
Deferred Stock Compensation Account shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect
any dividend or other distribution on the outstanding Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock or any split or consolidation of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock. If the outstanding Common Stock shall, in whole or in part, be
changed into or exchangeable for a different class or classes of securities of
the Corporation or securities of another corporation or cash or property other
than Common Stock, whether through reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation or otherwise, the Board shall adopt such
amendments to the Plan as it deems necessary to carry out the purposes of the
Plan, including the continuing deferral of any amount of any Deferred Stock
Compensation Account.

       (c) MANNER OF PAYMENT. The balance of a Director's Deferred Stock
Compensation Account will be paid in shares of Common Stock to the Director or,
in the event of the Director's death, to the Director's designated beneficiary,
in accordance with the Stock Deferral Election. A Director may elect at the time
of filing of the Notice of Election for a Stock Deferral Election to receive
payment of the shares of Common Stock credited to the Director's Deferred Stock
Compensation Account in annual installments rather than a lump sum, provided
that the payment period for installment payments shall not exceed ten years
following the Payment Commencement Date as described in Section 7 hereof. The
number of shares of Common Stock distributed in


                                       6
<PAGE>


each  installment  shall be  determined  by  multiplying  (i) the number of DSUs
credited to such Director's  Deferred Stock Compensation  Account on the date of
payment of such installment,  by (ii) a fraction,  the numerator of which is one
and the  denominator  of which is the number of  remaining  unpaid  installments
(including the installment  payment then being  determined) and by rounding such
result down to the nearest whole number of shares.  The balance of the number of
DSUs credited to such Director's  Deferred Stock  Compensation  Account shall be
appropriately  reduced in  accordance  with this  Section  6(c) to  reflect  the
installment  payments  made  hereunder.  DSUs  remaining  in  a  Deferred  Stock
Compensation  Account pending distribution of shares of Common Stock pursuant to
this  Section  6(c) shall  continue to be credited  with respect to dividends or
distributions paid on the Common Stock pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof and shall
be subject to adjustment  pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof. If a lump sum payment
or the final  installment  payment  hereunder  would result in the issuance of a
fractional share of Common Stock,  such fractional share shall not be issued and
cash in lieu of such fractional share shall be paid to the Director based on the
Fair Market Value of a share of Common  Stock,  as defined in Section 12 hereof,
on the date  immediately  preceding  the date of such payment.  The  Corporation
shall issue share  certificates  to the Director,  or the Director's  designated
beneficiary,  for the  shares  of  Common  Stock  distributed  hereunder,  or if
requested in writing by the Director and permitted  under such plan,  the shares
to  be  distributed  shall  be  added  to  the  Director's   account  under  the
Corporation's  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan. As of the date on which the
Director is entitled to receive  payment of shares of Common  Stock,  a Director
shall be a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to such shares.

Deferred Cash Compensation Account or a Deferred Stock Compensation Account
shall commence on the first business day next succeeding the 89th day following
the day on which the Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason,

                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

       A Director may designate, in the Beneficiary Designation form prescribed
by the Corporation, any person to whom payments of cash or shares of Common
Stock are to be made if the Director dies before receiving payment of all
amounts due hereunder. A beneficiary designation will be effective only after
the signed beneficiary designation form is filed with the Secretary of the
Corporation while the Director is alive and will cancel all beneficiary
designations signed and filed earlier. If the Director fails to designate a
beneficiary, or if all designated beneficiaries of the Director die before the
Director or before complete payment of all amounts due hereunder, any remaining
unpaid amounts shall be paid in one lump sum to the estate of the last to die of
the Director or the Director's designated beneficiaries, if any.

                          NON-ALIENABILITY OF BENEFITS

       Neither the Director nor any beneficiary designated by the Director shall
have the right to, directly or indirectly, alienate, assign, transfer, pledge,
anticipate or encumber (except by reason of death) any amount that is or may be
payable hereunder, nor shall any such amount be subject to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or
garnishment by creditors of the Director or the Director's designated
beneficiary or to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of
any Director or designated beneficiary, or transfer by operation of law in the
event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Director or any beneficiary, or any
legal process.

                                       10

                               NATURE OF ACCOUNTS

       Any Restricted Stock Unit Account, Deferred Cash Compensation Account or
Deferred Stock Compensation Account shall be established and maintained only on
the books and records of the Corporation, and no assets or funds of the
Corporation or the Plan or shares of Common Stock of the Corporation shall be
removed from the claims of the Corporation's general or judgment creditors or
otherwise made available until such amounts are actually payable to Directors or
their designated beneficiaries as provided herein. The Plan constitutes a mere
promise by the Corporation to make payments in the future. The Directors and
their designated beneficiaries shall have the status of, and their rights to
receive a payment of cash or shares of Common Stock under the Plan shall be no
greater than the rights of, general unsecured creditors of the Corporation. No
person shall be entitled to any voting rights with respect to shares credited to
any RSU or Deferred Stock Compensation Account which is not yet payable to a
Director or the Director's designated beneficiary. The Corporation shall not be
obligated under any circumstance to fund its financial obligations under the
Plan, and the Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for tax purposes.
However, the Corporation may, in its discretion, set aside funds in a trust or
other vehicle, subject to the claims of its creditors, in order to assist it in
meeting its obligations under the Plan, if such arrangement will not cause the
Plan to be considered a funded deferred compensation plan under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


                                       11

                   ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN; HARDSHIP WITHDRAWAL

       Full power and authority to construe, interpret, and administer the Plan
shall be vested in the Board. Decisions of the Board shall be final, conclusive,
and binding upon all parties. Notwithstanding the terms of a Cash Deferral
Election or a Stock Deferral Election made by a Director hereunder, the Board
may, in its sole discretion, permit the withdrawal of amounts credited to a
Deferred Cash Compensation Account or shares credited to a Deferred Stock


                                       8
<PAGE>


Compensation Account with respect to Director Fees previously payable, or permit
the early vesting and payment of RSUs previously awarded, upon the request of a
Director or the Director's representative, or following the death of a Director
upon the request of a Director's beneficiary or such beneficiary's
representative, if the Board determines that the Director or the Director's
beneficiary, as the case may be, is confronted with an unforeseeable emergency.
For this purpose, an unforeseeable emergency is an unanticipated emergency
caused by an event that is beyond the control of the Director or the Director's
beneficiary and that would result in severe financial hardship to the Director
or the Director's beneficiary if an early hardship withdrawal were not
permitted. The Director or the Director's beneficiary shall provide to the Board
such evidence as the Board, in its discretion, may require to demonstrate that
such emergency exists and financial hardship would occur if the withdrawal were
not permitted. The withdrawal shall be limited to the amount or to the number of
shares, as the case may be, necessary to meet the emergency. For purposes of the
Plan, a hardship shall be considered to constitute an immediate and unforeseen
financial hardship if the Director has an unexpected need for cash to pay for
expenses incurred by the Director or a member of the Director's immediate family
(spouse and/or natural or adopted children) such as those arising from illness,
casualty loss, or death. Cash needs arising from foreseeable events, such as the
purchase or building of a house or education expenses, will not be considered to
be the result of an unforeseeable financial emergency. Payment shall be made as
soon as practicable after the Board approves the payment and determines the
amount of the payment or number of shares which shall be withdrawn. In the case
of a hardship withdrawal from the Deferred Cash Compensation Account or Deferred
Stock Compensation Account, payment shall be made in a single lump sum from the
portion of the Deferred Cash Compensation Account or Deferred Stock Compensation
Account, as applicable, with the largest number and in reverse order of
installment payments, in each case in accordance with Section 5(b)(2)(E) if the
distribution is from the Deferred Cash Compensation Account. No Director shall
participate in any decision of the Board regarding such Director's request for a
withdrawal under this Section 11.


                                       12

                                FAIR MARKET VALUE

       Fair Market Value of the Common Stock ("Fair Market Value") shall be the
average of the closing price for all trading dates for the applicable period
covered by a payment. The applicable period for a quarterly payment or credit
shall be the three calendar months immediately preceding the calendar month
during which the day on which the payment or credit is being made. The
applicable period for a payment relating to a period other than a quarter shall
be determined under similar principles. The closing price of the Common Stock
for each day within the applicable period shall be as quoted in THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL (or in such other reliable publication as the Board or its delegate, in
its discretion, may determine to rely upon).

                       SECURITIES LAWS; ISSUANCE OF SHARES

       The obligation of the Corporation to issue RSUs or issue or credit shares
of Common Stock under the Plan shall be subject to (i) the effectiveness of a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with
respect to such shares, if deemed necessary or appropriate by counsel for the
Corporation, (ii) the condition that the shares shall have been listed (or
authorized for listing upon official notice of issuance) upon each stock
exchange, if any, on which the Common Stock shares may then be listed and (iii)
all other applicable laws, regulations, rules and orders which may then be in
effect. If, on the date on which any shares of Common Stock would be issued or
DSUs credited to a Deferred Stock Compensation Account, sufficient shares of
Common Stock are not available under the Plan or the Corporation is not
obligated to issue shares pursuant to this Section 13, then no shares of Common
Stock shall be issued or DSUs credited but rather, in the case of Common Stock
to be issued currently, cash shall be paid in payment of the Director Fees
payable, and in the case of a Deferred Stock Compensation Account, Director Fees
and dividends which would otherwise have been credited in DSUs shall be credited
in cash to a Deferred Cash Compensation Account in the name of the Director. The
Board shall adopt appropriate rules and regulations to carry out the intent of
the immediately preceding sentence if the need for such rules and regulations
arises.


                                       14

                                  GOVERNING LAW

       The provisions of this Plan shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.


                                       15

                    EFFECTIVE DATE; AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

         The Plan was adopted by the Board on December 4, 1996, and became
effective as of January 1, 1997. The Plan was amended and restated effective
October 2, 2001. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time, provided
that no such amendment or termination shall adversely affect rights with respect
to amounts or shares then credited to any Deferred Cash Compensation Account or
Deferred Stock Compensation Account.

the one (1) year period  preceding a Change in Control; or

                  1.2.2 his highest annual base salary in effect during the one
year period preceding his Date of Termination.

         For purposes of the foregoing, salary reduction elections pursuant to
Sections 125 and 401(k) of the Code shall not be taken into account.

         1.3   Annual Bonus  means with respect to an Executive the highest of:
               ------------

                  1.3.1 the average of the three highest bonuses paid or
payable, including any bonus or portion thereof which has been earned but
deferred, to him by the Company in respect of the five fiscal years (or such
shorter period during which he has been employed by the Company or eligible to

Change in Control occurs (annualized for any fiscal year during such period
consisting of less than twelve full months or with respect to which he has been
employed by the Company or eligible to receive a bonus for less than twelve full
months);

                  1.3.2 the bonus paid or payable (annualized as described

including his Date of Termination.

under any successor or replacement substitute plan, shall be treated as bonus
payments.

of an Executive, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be
done, by him in bad faith and without reasonable belief that his action or
omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act,
based upon prior approval given by the Board or upon the instruction or with the
approval of the Chief Executive Officer or an Executive's superior or based upon
the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done,
or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests
of the Company. The cessation of employment of an Executive shall not be deemed
to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to him a copy
of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than
three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to him and
he is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the
Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, he is guilty of

Plan Account in Absence of Section 2.4 Election.

In the event the Executive makes no election under Section 2.4 hereof, an amount
equal to his Vested Pension  Benefit shall be credited to him under the Deferred
Compensation  Plan and subject to the  provisions  of this  Subsection  2.5, the
provisions  of the  Deferred  Compensation  Plan shall apply  thereto as if such
amount were a Deferred AIP Award.  Within ten (10) days of the Change in Control
the  Executive  shall  select one or more  Investment  Options as defined in the
Deferred  Compensation  Plan to be  effective  with  respect to such  amount and
thereafter  may change his  selection of such  Investment  Options in accordance
with the provisions of the Deferred  Compensation Plan. Investment credits shall
be applied to the amount of his Vested  Pension  Benefit in accordance  with the
provisions  of the  Deferred  Compensation  Plan from the date of the  Change in
Control to the date of payment to the Executive in accordance with his selection
of such Investment Options. If the Executive makes no election under Section 2.4
hereof  and does not  select  one or more  Investment  Options as defined in the
Deferred  Compensation  Plan  within  ten (10) days of the  Change in Control in
accordance  with the  provisions  of the second  sentence of this  Section  2.5,
investment  credits shall be applied to the amount of his Vested Pension Benefit
from the date of the  Change in  Control  to the  earlier of the date he makes a
selection of  Investment  Options with respect  thereto in  accordance  with the
provisions  of the  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  and  the  date of  payment  in
accordance with the latest of his pre-Change in Control selections of Investment
Options  relating to his Deferred AIP Awards or Deferred PSU Awards,  if any. If
there are no such pre-Change in Control selections of Investment  Options,  then
investment  credits  shall be applied in accordance  with the  provisions of the
immediately  preceding  sentence  by  treating  the  Hershey  Fixed  Income Fund
Investment Option under the Deferred  Compensation Plan as his latest pre-Change
in Control selection of Investment  Options.  Within ten (10) days of the Change
in Control the  Executive  shall make a Deferral  Election  with  respect to his
Vested  Pension  Amount.  If the Executive  makes no election  under Section 2.4
hereof  and makes no  Deferral  Election  within  ten (10) days of the Change in
Control in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then for purposes
hereof he will be considered to have made a Deferral Election under the Deferred
Compensation  Plan to have his Vested Pension Amount paid to him, his designated
beneficiaries or his estate, as applicable, in accordance with the latest of his
pre-Change in Control Deferral  Elections relating to his Deferred AIP Awards or
Deferred PSU Awards, if any. If there are no such pre-Change in Control Deferral
Elections,  then  for  purposes  hereof  he will be  considered  to have  made a

his Vested Pension Amount.

         3.2   Severance Benefits. In addition to the payments provided for by
               ------------------
Section 3.1 hereof, the Company shall pay to an Executive the payments described
in Subsections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 below (the "Severance Benefits") in
accordance with such Subsections upon termination of his employment with the
Company during the Coverage Period, if his termination of employment either (i)
is a Section 1.39 Termination of Employment, or (ii) is (a) not by the Company
for Cause, (b) not by reason of his death or Disability or after his Mandatory
Retirement Age, if applicable, and (c) not by him without Good Reason.

                  3.2.1 Lump-Sum Severance Payment. In lieu of any further
                        --------------------------
salary payments to him for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the

(3) (or, if less, the number of years, including fractions, from the Date of

times the sum of (a), (b) and (c) where (a) equals his Annual Base Salary, (b)
equals his Annual Bonus and (c) equals his Highest PSU Amount.

                  3.2.2 Continued Benefits. For a thirty-six (36) month period
                        ------------------
(or, if less, the number of months from the Date of Termination until he would
have reached Mandatory Retirement Age, if applicable) after the Date of
Termination, the Company shall provide him with life insurance, health,
disability and other welfare benefits ("Welfare Benefits") substantially similar
in all respects to those which he was receiving immediately prior to the Notice
of Termination on substantially the same terms and conditions, including
contributions required from him for such benefits (without giving effect to any
reduction in such benefits subsequent to the Potential Change in Control
preceding the Change in Control or the Change in Control, which reduction
constitutes or may constitute Good Reason); provided that if he cannot continue
to participate in the Company plans providing Welfare Benefits, the Company
shall otherwise provide such benefits on the same after-tax basis as if
continued participation had been permitted. The Executive shall be entitled to
elect to change his level of coverage and/or his


                                       15
<PAGE>

choice of coverage  options (such as Executive only or family medical  coverage)
with respect to the Welfare Benefits to be provided by the Company to him to the
same extent that  actively  employed  executives of the Company are permitted to
make such changes;  provided,  however, that in the event of any such changes he
shall pay the  amount of any cost  increase  that would  actually  be paid by an
actively  employed  executive of the Company by reason of such actively employed
executive  making the same  change in level of  coverage  or  coverage  options.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,   in  the  event  that  the  Executive  becomes
reemployed  with  another  employer  and  becomes  eligible  to receive  welfare
benefits form such  employer,  the Welfare  Benefits  described  herein shall be
secondary to such benefits,  but only to the extent that the Company  reimburses
him for any increased  cost and provides any  additional  benefits  necessary to
give him the Welfare Benefits provided hereunder.

                  3.2.3 Outstanding Awards. If an Executive's Date of
                        ------------------
Termination occurs within the Coverage Period and during any calendar year
following the calendar year during which a Change in Control occurs, he shall be
entitled to a lump sum cash payment with respect to each outstanding contingent
target AIP and PSU grant under the KEIP or any similar types of grants under any
replacement plans or programs equal to the sum of :

                           3.2.3.1    the sum of the  product of (x) and (y)for
each then  outstanding  contingent  target PSU grant  under the KEIP (or similar
types of grants under any replacement  plan or program) for the applicable award
period that  includes his Date of  Termination,  where (x) is an amount equal to
the 100% target award amount of such outstanding contingent target PSU grant and
(y) is a  fraction  the  numerator  of  which  is the  number  of days  from and
including  the first  day of the award  period  applicable  to such  outstanding
contingent  target PSU grant that includes the  Executive's  Date of Termination
until (and  including) his Date of Termination  and the  denominator of which is
the number of days in the award period applicable to such outstanding contingent
target PSU grant; and

                           3.2.3.2    the sum of the  product of (x) and (y) for
each then outstanding contingent target AIP grant made to him under the KEIP (or
similar  types of  grants  under  any  replacement  plans or  programs)  for the
applicable  award period that includes his Date of Termination,  where (x) is an
amount  equal  to the  greater  of (A) the  100%  target  award  amount  of such
outstanding contingent target AIP grant, and (B) the amount that would have been
payable  to him  under  such  contingent  target  AIP grant as of the end of the
applicable  award period,  calculated  utilizing as the  applicable  performance
factors his and the Company's  actual  performance on an annualized  basis as of
his Date of  Termination,  and (y) is a fraction  the  numerator of which is the
number of days from and including  the first day of the award period  applicable
to such  outstanding  contingent AIP grant that includes his Date of Termination
until (and  including) his Date of Termination  and the  denominator of which is
the number of days in such applicable award period.

Contingent target PSU grants under the KEIP or a similar type of grant under a
replacement plan or program shall be valued at the highest closing price of the
Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the period running
from sixty (60) days prior to the Change in Control until the Executive's Date
of Termination.

                  3.2.4 Relocation Allowance. In the event that an Executive
                        --------------------
relocates following his Date of Termination and during the Coverage Period at
the request of a successor employer, the Company shall pay to him a relocation
allowance of $75,000; provided, however, that any such payment shall be reduced
by any payments received by him from such successor employer for the purpose of
reimbursing him for costs of relocation. The Company shall pay him such
relocation allowance within five (5) business days after delivery of his written
request and may condition the payment of the relocation allowance upon his
agreeing in writing to report to the Company any such payments from any
successor employer and agreeing in writing to reimburse to the Company any
amounts received from the Company pursuant to this Subsection 3.2.4 that should
have been so reduced.

         3.3   Gross-Up Payment. In the event that an Executive becomes entitled
               ---------------
to the Severance Benefits or any other benefits or payments under this Plan
(other than pursuant to this Section 3.3), or the KEIP by reason of the
accelerated vesting of stock options thereunder (together, the "Total
Benefits"), and in the event that any of the Total Benefits will be subject to
the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to him an additional amount (the "Gross-Up
Payment") such that the net amount retained by him, after deduction of any
Excise Tax on the Total Benefits and any federal, state and local income tax,
Excise Tax and FICA and Medicare withholding taxes upon the payment provided for
by this Section 3.3, shall be equal to the Total Benefits.

         For purposes of determining whether any of the Total Benefits will be
subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) any other
payments or benefits received or to be received by an Executive in connection
with a Change in Control or his termination of employment (whether pursuant to
the terms of this Plan or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the
Company, any Person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any Person
affiliated with the Company or such Person) shall be treated as parachute
payments within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all excess
parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) shall be treated as
subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel")
selected by the Company's independent auditors and acceptable to the Executive,
such other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute
parachute payments, or such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part)
represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the Base Amount, or are
otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, (ii) the amount of the Total Benefits
which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser
of (A) the total amount of the Total Benefits reduced by the amount of such
Total Benefits that in the opinion of Tax Counsel are not parachute payments, or
(B) the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) (after applying clause (i), above), and (iii) the value of any
non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the
Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections
280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the
Gross-Up Payment, an Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at
the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in
which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the
highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of his residence on
the Date of Termination, net of the reduction in federal income taxes which


                                       17
<PAGE>

could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes (calculated by
assuming that any reduction under Section 68 of the Code in the amount of
itemized deductions allowable to him applies first to reduce the amount of such
state and local income taxes that would otherwise be deductible by him).

         In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less
than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination of an
Executive's employment, he shall repay to the Company, at the time that the
amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the
Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the
Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax, federal, state and local income
taxes and FICA and Medicare withholding taxes imposed on the portion of the
Gross-Up Payment being repaid by him to the extent that such repayment results
in a reduction in Excise Tax, FICA and Medicare withholding taxes and/or
federal, state or local income taxes) plus interest on the amount of such
repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. The Company
may require an Executive to agree in writing to the repayment obligation imposed
by the preceding sentence as a condition to receiving the Gross-Up Payment. In
the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into
account hereunder at the time of the termination of an Executive's employment
(including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be
determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an
additional Gross-Up Payment, determined as previously described, to him in
respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by him
with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is
finally determined.

         3.4   Timing of Payments.  The payments provided for:
               ------------------

                  3.4.1 in Subsections 3.1.1, 3.1.3, 3.1.5, 3.2.1 and 3.2.3, and
in Section 3.3 hereof shall be made to an Executive not later than the fifth
(5th) day following his Date of Termination; provided, however, that if the
amounts of such payments cannot be finally determined on or before such day the
Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in
good faith by the Company, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay
the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following the Date of
Termination to the payment of such remainder) as soon as the amount thereof can
be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Date
of Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds
the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall
constitute a loan by the Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth (5th)
business day after demand by the Company (together with interest at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the fifth (5th) day following
the Date of Termination to the payment of such remainder);

                  3.4.2 in Subsection 3.1.4 hereof shall be made to an Executive
on the later of (i) the first day of January of the year first following the
year during which his Date of Termination occurs and (ii) the one hundred
twentieth (120th) day following his Date of Termination if prior to his Date of
Termination he elects, in his sole discretion, to receive his previously unpaid
Deferred AIP Awards at such time. In the event the Executive makes such election
and the


                                       18
<PAGE>

amount of the payment described in Subsection 3.1.4 cannot be finally determined
on or before the later of such one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day or January 1,
as  applicable,  the  Company  shall pay to the  Executive  on such one  hundred
twentieth (120th) day or January 1, as applicable, an estimate, as determined in
good faith by the Company,  of the minimum  amount of such payment and shall pay
the  remainder of such payment  (together  with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or
January  1, as  applicable,  to the  payment of such  remainder)  as soon as the
amount thereof can be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th)
day after such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or January 1, as applicable. In
the  event  that  the  amount  of  the  estimated  payment  exceeds  the  amount
subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by
the  Company to the  Executive,  payable on the fifth (5th)  business  day after
demand by the Company  (together  with  interest at the rate provided in Section
1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day following
the Date of  Termination  or January 1, as  applicable,  to the  payment of such
remainder).  In the event the Executive  makes no such election,  his previously
unpaid  Deferred  AIP  Awards  shall  be paid  in  accordance  with  each of his
applicable Deferral Elections;

                  3.4.3 in Subsection 3.1.6 shall be made to an Executive on the
later of (i) the first day of January of the year first following the year
during which his Date of Termination occurs and (ii) the one hundred twentieth
(120th) day following his Date of Termination if prior to his Date of
Termination he elects, in his sole discretion, to receive his previously unpaid
Deferred PSU Awards at such time. In the event the Executive makes such election
and the amount of the payment provided for in Subsection 3.1.6 cannot be finally
determined on or before the later of such one hundred twentieth (120th) day or
January 1, as applicable, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such one
hundred twentieth (120th) day or January 1, as applicable, an estimate, as
determined in good faith by the Company, of the minimum amount of such payment
and shall pay the remainder of such payment (together with interest at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from such one hundred twentieth
(120th) day or January 1, as applicable, to the payment of such remainder) as
soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event later than the
thirtieth (30th) day after such one hundred twentieth (120th day or January 1,
as applicable. In the event that the amount of the estimated payment exceeds the
amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
loan by the Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth (5th) business day
after demand by the Company (together with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the one hundred twentieth (120th) day
following the Date of Termination or January 1, as applicable, to the payment of
such remainder). In the event the Executive makes no such election, his
previously unpaid Deferred PSU Awards shall be paid in accordance with each of
his applicable Deferral Elections; and

                  3.4.4 in Subsection 3.1.7 shall be made to him on the later of
(i) the first day of January following his Date of Termination and (ii) the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day following his Date of Termination if, prior to his
Date of Termination, he elects, in his sole discretion, to receive such payment
at such time. In the event the Executive makes no such election, then his Vested
Pension Amount shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5.

         3.5   Reimbursement of Legal Costs. The Company shall pay to an
               ----------------------------
Executive  all  legal  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by  him as a  result  of a
termination of his employment which entitles him to any payments under this Plan
(including  all such  fees and  expenses,  if any,  incurred  in  contesting  or
disputing  any  Notice of Intent to  Terminate  under  Section  4.3 hereof or in
seeking to obtain or enforce  any right or benefit  provided  by this Plan or in
connection  with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent  attributable  to the
application  of Section  4999 of the Code to any  payment  or  benefit  provided
hereunder).  Such  payments  shall be made within five (5)  business  days after
delivery of his  respective  written  requests for payment  accompanied  by such
evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require.

         3.6   Executives' Covenant. The Company may condition the payment of
               --------------------
the amounts and provision of the benefits  described in Article 3 of the Plan to
an Executive upon his providing to the Company a written agreement that, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Plan, in the event of a Potential  Change in
Control, he will remain in the employ of the Company until the earliest of (a) a
date which is nine months  after the date of such  Potential  Change in Control,
(b) the date of a Change  in  Control,  (c) the date of his  termination  of his
employment  for Good Reason  (determined  by treating  the  Potential  Change in
Control for this  purpose as a Change in Control in applying the  definition  of
Good Reason) or by reason of death or  Disability,  (d) the  termination  by the
Company of his  employment  for any reason or (e) his attaining  age  sixty-five
(65).

                           COMPENSATION DURING DISPUTE

         4.1   Notice of Intent to Terminate. After a Change in Control, any
               -----------------------------
purported termination of an Executive's employment (other than by reason of
death) must be preceded by a written Notice of Intent to Terminate from him to
the Company or the Company to him, as applicable, in accordance with Section
8.17 hereof. For purposes of this Plan, a Notice of Intent to Terminate shall
mean a notice which shall indicate the notifying party's opinion regarding the
specific provisions of this Plan that will apply upon such termination and shall
set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a
basis for the application of the provisions so indicated. Further, a Notice of
Intent to Terminate for Cause is required to include a copy of a resolution duly
adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the
entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called and
held for the purpose of considering such termination (after reasonable notice to
the Executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard
before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, he was
guilty of conduct set forth in Subsection 1.6.1 or 1.6.2 herein, and specifying
the particulars thereof in detail.

         4.2   Date of Termination. Date of Termination, with respect to any
               -------------------
purported termination of an Executive's employment after a Change in Control,
shall mean (except as provided in Section 4.3 hereof) (a) if his employment is
terminated by reason of his death, his


                                       20
<PAGE>

date of death (b) if his  employment is terminated for  Disability,  thirty (30)
days after Notice of Intent to Terminate  is given  (provided  that he shall not
have returned to the full-time performance of his duties during such thirty (30)
day period),  and (c) if his employment is terminated for any other reason,  the
date specified in the Notice of Intent to Terminate  (which (i) in the case of a
termination by the Company,  shall not be less than thirty (30) days,  except in
the case of a termination  for Cause in which case it shall not be less than ten
(10) days,  provided  that the  Company  may  require  him to not report to work
during  such ten (10) day  period  and (ii) in the case of a  termination  by an
Executive,  shall not be less than  fifteen  (15) days nor more than  sixty (60)
days, respectively, from the date such Notice of Intent to Terminate is given).

         4.3   Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15) days after
               ------------------------------
any Notice of Intent to Terminate is given (within eight (8) days in the case of
a termination for Cause by the Company), or, if later, prior to the Date of
Termination (as determined without regard to this Section 4.3), the person
receiving such Notice of Intent to Terminate notifies the person giving such
notice that a dispute exists concerning the termination or the provisions of
this Plan that apply to such termination, the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written
agreement of the parties to such dispute or by a final judgment, order or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to
which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been
perfected); provided, however, that the Date of Termination shall be extended by
a notice of dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the person
giving such notice pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable
diligence.

                        PLAN MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION

         The Plan may be amended or terminated by resolution of the Board at any
time; provided, however, that: (a) Schedule I hereto may be amended at any time
and in any manner by resolution of the Compensation Committee of the Board upon
recommendation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer; and (b) Schedule I
hereto may be amended at any time by the Company's Chief Executive Officer to
delete any one or more persons therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the
Plan may not be terminated or amended in a manner adverse to the interests of
any Executive, without his consent (including the amendment of Schedule I hereto
to delete him therefrom) (i) after a Potential Change in Control occurs and for
one (1) year following the cessation of a Potential Change in Control, or (ii)
for the two-year period following consummation of the transaction(s) resulting
from or in the Change in Control; and (b) no termination of this Plan or
amendment hereof in a manner adverse to the interests of any Executive, without
his consent (including the amendment of Schedule I hereto to delete him
therefrom), shall be effective if such termination or amendment occurs (i) at
the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect
a Change in Control or (ii) in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in
Control or Potential Change in Control. For this purpose, the cessation of a
Potential Change in Control occurs if a Change in Control has not occurred
within one year following the Potential Change in Control. In the event that the
termination of this Plan by the Company or an amendment hereof in a manner
adverse to the interests of any Executive (without his consent) occurs within
six (6) months prior to a Potential Change in Control or a Change in Control,
there shall be a presumption that the conditions of subclauses (i) and (ii) of
clause (b) of the next preceding sentence shall have been met. Upon the
expiration of the Coverage Period, the Plan may not be amended in any manner
which would adversely affect the rights which any Executive has at that time to
receive any and all payments or benefits pursuant to Articles 2, 3, and 4 by
reason of a Change in Control which has theretofore occurred or by reason of a
termination of his employment during the Coverage Period, and the Company's
obligations to make such payments and provide such benefits shall survive any
termination of the Plan.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS


         8.1   Terminations in Anticipation of Change in Control. An Executive's
               -------------------------------------------------
employment shall be deemed to have been terminated by the Company without Cause
during the Coverage Period if his employment is terminated by the Company
without Cause prior to a Change in Control or Potential Change in Control and
such termination of employment (a) was at the request of a third party who had
indicated an intention to take or had taken steps reasonably calculated to
effect a Change in Control, or (b) otherwise arose in connection with or in
anticipation of a Change in Control and (c) in either case, a Change in Control
does occur which


                                       23
<PAGE>

may  involve  such third  party (or a party  competing  with such third party to
effectuate a Change in Control). An Executive shall be deemed to have terminated
his employment  for Good Reason during the Coverage  Period if he terminates his
employment with Good Reason prior to a Change in Control or Potential  Change in
Control if the circumstance or event which  constitutes Good Reason (a) occurred
at the request of a third party who had  indicated  an  intention to take or had
taken  steps  reasonably  calculated  to  effect a  Change  in  Control,  or (b)
otherwise  arose in connection  with or in  anticipation of a Change in Control,
and (c) in either  case,  a Change in Control  does occur which may involve such
third party (or a party  competing  with such third party to effectuate a Change
in  Control).  In the event of a  termination  of  employment  described in this
Section 8.1, the Executive  shall be entitled to all payments and other benefits
to which he would have been entitled had such  termination  occurred  during the
Coverage Period (other than salary  pursuant to Subsection  3.1.1 hereof for any
period  after the actual  date of  termination)  and he shall be  entitled to an
additional payment in an amount which shall compensate him to the extent that he
was deprived by such  termination  of the  opportunity  prior to  termination of
employment  to  exercise  any  stock  options  granted  to him  under  the  KEIP
(including  any such stock options that were not  exercisable at the time of his
termination of  employment) at the highest market price of the Company's  Common
Stock  reached in connection  with the Change in Control or Potential  Change in
Control if a  Potential  Change in Control  shall occur and not be followed by a
Change in Control within twelve (12) months of the Potential  Change in Control.
In the event that the  termination of employment of an Executive as described in
this  Section 8.1 occurs  following a Potential  Change in Control or within six
(6) months  prior to a Change in  Control,  there  shall be a  presumption  that
clauses (a) and (b) of the first two  sentences  of this  Section 8.1 shall have
been met.

         8.2   Burden. In any proceeding (regardless of who initiates such
               ------
proceeding) in which the payment of Severance Benefits or other compensation or
benefits under this Plan is at issue, (i) the burden of proof as to whether
Cause exists for purposes of this Plan shall be upon the Company and (ii) in the
event that the last sentence of Section 8.1 applies, the Company shall have the
burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that a termination of
employment has not been made in anticipation of a Change in Control as
contemplated by Section 8.1.

         8.3   No Right to Continued Employment. Nothing in the Plan shall be
               --------------------------------
deemed to give any Executive the right to be retained in the employ of the
Company, or to interfere with the right of the Company to discharge him at any
time and for any lawful reason, with or without notice, subject in all cases to
the terms of this Plan.

         8.4   No Assignment of Benefits. Except as otherwise provided herein or
               -------------------------
by law, no right or interest of any Executive under the Plan shall be assignable
or transferable, in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or
otherwise, including without limitation by execution, levy, garnishment,
attachment, pledge or in any manner; no attempted assignment or transfer thereof
shall be effective; and no right or interest of any Executive under the Plan
shall be liable for, or subject to, any obligation or liability of such
Executive.

         8.5   Death. This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
               -----
by an Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs,


                                       24
<PAGE>

distributees, devisees and legatees. If an Executive shall
die while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder (other than amounts
which, by their terms, terminate upon his death) if he had continued to live,
all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
with the terms of this Plan to the executors, personal representatives or
administrators of his estate.

         8.6   Incompetency. Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of an
               ------------
Executive, if legally incompetent or incapable of giving a receipt therefor,
shall be deemed paid when paid to his guardian or to the party providing or
reasonably appearing to provide for his care, and such payment shall fully
discharge the Company, the Plan Administrator and all other parties with respect
thereto.

         8.7   Reduction of Benefits By Legally Required Benefits.
               --------------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Company
is obligated by law or by contract (other than under this Plan) to pay severance
pay, a termination indemnity, notice pay, or the like, to an Executive or if the
Company  is  obligated  by law or by  contract  to  provide  advance  notice  of
separation  ("Notice  Period")  to an  Executive,  then any  Severance  Benefits
payable to him  hereunder  shall be reduced by the amount of any such  severance
pay, termination  indemnity,  notice pay or the like, as applicable,  and by the
amount of any pay received during any Notice Period;  provided however, that the
period  following  a Notice of Intent to  Terminate  shall not be  considered  a
Notice Period.

         8.8   Enforceability. If any provision of the Plan shall be held
               --------------
invalid or unenforceable,  such invalidity or unenforceability  shall not affect
any other provisions  hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if
such provisions had not been included.

         8.9   Effective  Date.  The Plan  shall be  effective  as of the
               ---------------
Effective  Date and shall remain in effect  unless and until  terminated  by the
Board, subject to the requirements of Article 7 hereof.

         8.10  No Mitigation. The Company agrees that, if an Executive's
               -------------
employment by the Company is terminated during the Coverage Period, the
Executive is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to
reduce any amounts payable to him by the Company pursuant to this Plan. Further,
the amount of any payment or benefit provided for under this Plan (other than to
the extent provided in Subsections 3.2.2 and 3.2.4) shall not be reduced by any
compensation earned by him as a result of employment by another employer, by
retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by him to
the Company, or otherwise.

         8.11  Successors. In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon
               ----------
any successor to the Company, the Company shall be obligated to require any
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation,
operation of law, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform the
Company's obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had
taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement
prior to the effectiveness of


                                       25
<PAGE>

any such succession  shall entitle each Executive to  compensation  and benefits
from  the  Company  in the  same  amount  and on the  same  terms as he would be
entitled to  hereunder if he were to terminate  his  employment  for Good Reason
during the Coverage Period.

         8.12  Consent to Cancellation of Awards and Reduction of SERP Benefit.
               ---------------------------------------------------------------
The Company may condition the payment to an Executive of his Vested Current
Bonus Amount, Vested Current PSU Amount, Vested Deferred Bonus Amount and/or
Vested Deferred PSU Amount upon his providing a written consent to the
cancellation of the applicable contingent target AIP and PSU grants and AIP and
PSU Awards for which payment has been deferred on which his Vested Current Bonus
Amount, Vested Current PSU Amount, Vested Deferred Bonus Amount and/or Vested
Deferred PSU Amount is based and in lieu of which such amounts are paid. The
Company may condition the payment to an Executive of his Vested Pension Amount
or the providing of any benefit or payment under Section 2.5 or Subsection 3.4.4
hereof upon his providing a written consent to, as applicable, (i) the reduction
of the benefit to be paid under the SERP (whether in the form of a monthly
payment to him and his surviving spouse or as a lump sum) such reduction to be
in the amount of the SERP Benefit which was used in the calculation of his
Vested Pension Benefit or the amount of any payments or benefits provided under
Subsection 3.4.4, or (ii) the reduction of his Excess Account under the CLRP,
such reduction to be in the amount of the CLRP Benefit which was used in the
calculation of his Vested Pension Benefit.

         8.13  Employment by Subsidiary. For purposes of this Plan, an Executive
               ------------------------
who is employed by a Subsidiary shall be treated as if employed by the Company
and his entitlement to benefits hereunder shall be determined as if he were
employed by the Company. For such purpose, the Subsidiary shall be treated as if
it were an unincorporated division of the Company.

         8.14  Waiver. No waiver by an Executive at any time of any breach of
               ------
the terms of this Plan, or compliance  with,  any condition or provision of this
Plan to be  performed  by the  Company  shall be deemed a waiver of  similar  or
dissimilar  provisions  or  conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent
time.

         8.15  Withholding  Taxes.  Any payments to an Executive  provided  for
               ------------------
hereunder  shall  be  paid  net of any  applicable  withholding  required  under
federal,  state  or local  law and any  additional  withholding  to which he has
agreed.

         8.16  Construction. The headings and captions herein are provided for
               ------------
reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of the Plan, and
shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan. Neither the gender nor
the number (singular or plural) of any word shall be construed to exclude
another gender or number when a different gender or number would be appropriate.

         8.17  Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
               ------
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been duly given when
delivered or mailed by United States Mail, first class, postage prepaid,
addressed to the intended recipient at his last known address


                                       26
<PAGE>

(which in the case of an Executive shall be the address  specified by him in any
written notice provided to the Company in accordance with this Section 8.17).

         8.18  Statutory  Changes.  All  references  to sections of the
               ------------------
Exchange  Act or the  Code  shall  be  deemed  also to  refer  to any  successor
provisions to such sections.

         8.19  Governing  Law. This Plan shall be construed  and enforced
               --------------
according  to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not  preempted  by
Federal law, which shall otherwise control.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                            TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE
                       UNRELATED TO A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN
                          CONTROL OR CHANGE IN CONTROL

         9.1   Subject to the terms and conditions noted below, in the event
Executive's employment with the Company is, or is deemed to be, terminated
without cause (as defined below), regardless of whether a Potential Change in
Control or Change in Control has occurred or is pending (such termination
hereinafter is referred to as "Change in Status Event"):

                  From and after the date of the Change in Status Event for a
period of two years thereafter, the Company will continue Executive as an active
employee on a paid leave of absence with benefit coverage, excluding disability
coverage. Executive's base compensation during the paid leave of absence will
equal his or her Annual Base Salary as defined in Section 1.2 (substituting
"Change in Status Event" for "Change in Control") of Article 1 of this Group 3A
Plan. Executive shall also remain a participant in the AIP during the paid leave
of absence period and Executive's target percentage for AIP payment purposes
will be that in effect just prior to the Change in Status Event, and Executive
will be scored on the basis of the actual achievement of the Company's
performance targets for AIP, but up to a maximum of 100%. Executive will
additionally be entitled to payments for AIP and PSU grants for any previously
deferred awards or any awards covering periods ending prior to the date of the
Change in Status Event that have been earned but not yet paid prior to the date
of the Change in Status Event.

                  9.1.1 During the above leave of absence: (a) Executive's stock
options granted prior to the Change in Status Event will continue to vest in
accordance with the vesting schedule(s) applicable under the terms of the
grant(s), but (b) Executive will not be eligible to participate in or receive
new grants or benefits under the LTIP and will not be eligible for participation
in or the payment of benefits under the Executive Benefits Protection Plan
(except for under this Article 9), the Employee Benefits Protection Plan, or the
Severance Benefits Plan. If Executive meets the eligibility requirements of
paragraph 3 of the Corporation's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
and elects to retire from employment with the Corporation during the leave of
absence, Executive's paid leave of absence will cease and the


                                       27
<PAGE>


Executive  will be treated for all purposes as a retiree in accordance  with the
terms of the SERP and the Corporation's other benefit plans.

         9.2   Executive's voluntary resignation from the Company shall not
constitute a Change in Status Event, and therefore will not entitle Executive to
the benefits provided for in Section 9.1 above. In such event, Executive would
be entitled to the benefits provided under the benefit plans of the Company to
which Executive is entitled in accordance with the terms of those plans.

         9.3   Termination of Executive's employment "without cause" for
purposes of this Article 9 shall mean termination of employment by the Company
not based on "cause" as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the SERP.

         9.4   The severance arrangements of this Article 9 shall not be
considered to constitute an employment contract. The terms and conditions of the
Long-Term Incentive Program Participation Agreement and Mutual Agreement to
Arbitrate Claims by and between Executive and the Company ("Participation and
Arbitration Agreement"), are incorporated herein by reference and made a part
hereof as if fully set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provisions to the
contrary in the Participation and Arbitration Agreement, the terms and
conditions thereof shall remain in effect for three years after Executive's
Change in Status Event regardless of whether Executive is eligible or not to
receive benefits under the SERP.



         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused the Plan to be amended and
restated as of the 2nd day of October, 2001.
