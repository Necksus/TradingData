                                     PART I

Item 1. Business.

(a) General Development of Business

                                    General

     Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of
Virginia. Following Kraft's formation, Philip Morris Companies Inc. ("Philip
Morris") transferred to Kraft its ownership interest in Kraft Foods North
America, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through a capital contribution. During
2000, Philip Morris transferred management responsibility for its food
businesses in Latin America to Kraft Foods North America, Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Kraft Foods International, Inc. In addition, on
December 11, 2000, Kraft acquired all of the outstanding shares of Nabisco
Holdings Corp. ("Nabisco"). Kraft, together with its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as the "Company"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of branded
foods and beverages in the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia
Pacific.

     Prior to June 13, 2001, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip
Morris. On June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering
("IPO") of 280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00
per share. The IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and expenses, of
$8.4 billion were used to retire a portion of an $11.0 billion long-term note
payable to Philip Morris incurred in connection with the acquisition of Nabisco.
After the IPO, Philip Morris owns approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares
of the Company's capital stock through its ownership of 49.5% of the Company's
Class A common stock and 100% of the Company's Class B common stock. The
Company's Class A common stock has one vote per share while the Company's Class
B common stock has ten votes per share. Therefore, Philip Morris holds 97.7% of
the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.

                           Source of Funds--Dividends

     Because the Company is a holding company, its principal source of funds is
dividends from its subsidiaries. The Company's principal wholly-owned
subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in
their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to
their common stock.

(b) Financial Information About Industry Segments

     The Company conducts its global business through its subsidiaries: Kraft
Foods North America, Inc. ("Kraft Foods North America") and Kraft Foods
International, Inc. ("Kraft Foods International"). The Company has operations in
68 countries and sells its products in more than 145 countries. Kraft Foods
North America operates in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and manages its
operations by product category, while Kraft Foods International manages its
operations by geographic region. Kraft Foods North America's reportable segments
are Cheese, Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages,
Desserts and Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Kraft Foods North America's
food service business within the United States and its businesses in Canada and
Mexico are reported through the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment. Kraft Foods
International's reportable segments are Europe, Middle East and Africa; and
Latin America and Asia Pacific.

     Operating revenues and operating companies income (together with a
reconciliation to operating income) attributable to each such segment for each
of the last three years are set forth in Note 13 to the Company's consolidated
financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the 2001 Annual
Report.

shift in relative percentages toward the Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery and
Latin America and Asia Pacific segments.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

                         Acquisitions and Divestitures

Nabisco Acquisition

     On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Nabisco for $55 per share in cash. The purchase of the outstanding shares,
retirement of employee stock options and other payments totaled approximately
$15.2 billion. In addition, the acquisition included the assumption of
approximately $4.0 billion of existing Nabisco debt. The Company financed the
acquisition through the issuance of two long-term notes payable to Philip Morris
totaling $15.0 billion and short-term intercompany borrowings of $255 million.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. Nabisco's balance sheet
was consolidated with the Company as of December 31, 2000, and beginning January
1, 2001, Nabisco's earnings have been included in the consolidated operating
results of the Company; however, Nabisco's earnings from December 11, 2000 to
December 31, 2000 were not included in the consolidated operating results of the
Company since such amounts were insignificant. The Company's interest cost
associated with acquiring Nabisco has been included in interest and other debt
expense, net, on the Company's consolidated statements of earnings for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

     The integration of Nabisco into the Company has continued throughout 2001.
The closure of a number of Nabisco domestic and international facilities
resulted in severance and other exit costs of $379 million, which are included
in the adjustments for the allocation of purchase price. The closures will
result in the termination of approximately 7,500 employees and will require
total cash payments of $373 million, of which approximately $74 million has been
spent through December 31, 2001. Substantially all of the closures will be
completed by the end of 2002.

     The integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company will also
result in the closure or reconfiguration of several of the Company's existing
facilities. The aggregate charges to the Company's consolidated statement of
earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and integrate Nabisco are
estimated to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. During 2001, the
Company incurred pre-tax integration costs of $53 million for site
reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the United

                                        2
<PAGE>

States. In October 2001, the Company announced that it was offering a voluntary
retirement program to certain salaried employees in the United States. The
program is expected to terminate approximately 750 employees and will result in
an estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $140 million upon final employee
acceptance in the first quarter of 2002. This pre-tax charge is part of the
previously discussed $200 million to $300 million in pre-tax charges related to
the integration of Nabisco. For a detailed discussion of the Nabisco
acquisition, see Note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial statements,
incorporated herein by reference to the 2001 Annual Report.

     By combining Nabisco's operations with the operations of Kraft Foods North
America and Kraft Foods International, the Company achieved net cost synergies
of over $100 million in 2001 and expects to generate net cost synergies of $300
million in 2002, $475 million in 2003 and ongoing annual cost savings of $600
million thereafter.

Other Acquisitions and Divestitures

     During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco
and Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland.
The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $194 million. During
2000, the Company purchased the outstanding common stock of Balance Bar Co., a
maker of energy and nutrition snack products. In a separate transaction, the
Company also acquired Boca Burger, Inc., a privately held manufacturer and
marketer of soy-based meat alternatives. The total cost of these and other
smaller acquisitions was $365 million. During 1999, the Company purchased
several small North American and international food businesses for $14 million.

     During 2001, the Company sold several small food businesses. The aggregate
proceeds received in these transactions were $21 million, on which the Company
recorded a pre-tax gain of $8 million. During 2000, the Company sold a French
confectionery business for proceeds of $251 million, on which a pre-tax gain of
$139 million was recorded. Several small international and domestic food
businesses were also sold in 2000. The aggregate proceeds received in these
transactions were $300 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of
$172 million. During 1999, the Company sold several small international and
domestic food businesses. The aggregate proceeds received in these transactions
were $175 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $62 million.
Pre-tax gains on these divestitures were included in marketing, administration
and research costs on the Company's consolidated statements of earnings.

     The impact of these acquisitions and divestitures, excluding Nabisco, has
not had a material effect on the Company's results of operations.

                              Markets and Products

     The Company's portfolio of brands includes 61 brands with 2001 revenues
over $100 million, accounting for 78% of the Company's 2001 revenues. Six of
these brands--Kraft, Nabisco, Oscar Mayer, Post, Maxwell House, and
Philadelphia--had 2001 revenues over $1 billion, accounting for 39% of the
Company's 2001 revenues.

     The Company's brands span five consumer sectors, as follows:

     -  Snacks--primarily cookies, crackers, salty snacks and confectionery;

     -  Beverages--primarily coffee, aseptic juice drinks and powdered soft
        drinks;

     -  Cheese--primarily natural, process and cream cheeses;

     -  Grocery--primarily ready-to-eat cereals, enhancers and desserts; and

     -  Convenient Meals--primarily frozen pizza, packaged dinners, lunch
        combinations and processed meats.

                  Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials

     Kraft Foods North America's products are generally sold to supermarket
chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers,
distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations and other retail food
outlets. In general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. Food
products are distributed through distribution centers, satellite warehouses,
company-operated and public cold-storage facilities, depots and other
facilities. Most distribution in North America is in the form of warehouse
delivery, but snacks and frozen pizza are distributed through two
direct-store-delivery systems. Selling

                                        6

efforts are supported by national and regional advertising on television and
radio as well as outdoor media such as billboards and in magazines and
newspapers, as well as by sales promotions, product displays, trade incentives,
informative material offered to customers and other promotional activities.
Subsidiaries and affiliates of Kraft Foods International sell their food
products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of
independent sales offices and agents.

     Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries
are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of their business.
Competitors include large national and international companies and numerous
local and regional companies. Some competitors may have different profit
objectives and some international competitors may be less susceptible to
currency exchange rates. In addition, certain international competitors benefit
from government subsidies. Products of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods
International also compete with generic products and private-label products of
food retailers, wholesalers and cooperatives. Kraft Foods North America, Kraft
Foods International and their subsidiaries compete primarily on the basis of
product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing,
advertising and price. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are
required to maintain or improve a brand's market position or to introduce a new
product.

     Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries
are major purchasers of milk, cheese, nuts, green coffee beans, cocoa, corn
products, wheat, rice, pork, poultry, beef, vegetable oil, and sugar and other
sweeteners. They also use significant quantities of glass, plastic and cardboard
to package their products. They continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost
trends of these commodities to enable them to take appropriate action to obtain
ingredients and packaging needed for production.

     Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries
purchase a substantial portion of their milk requirements from independent
agricultural cooperatives and individual producers, and a substantial portion of
their cheese requirements from independent sources. The prices for milk and
other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government
programs, as well as by market supply and demand. Dairy commodity costs on
average have been higher in 2001 than those seen in 2000.

     The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans,
which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by
the quality and availability of supply, trade agreements among producing and
consuming nations, the unilateral policies of the producing nations, changes in
the value of the United States dollar in relation to certain other currencies
and consumer demand for coffee products. In 2001, coffee bean prices have been
lower than in 2000. A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products
is cocoa, which is purchased on world markets, and the price of which is
affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of
the British pound sterling and the United States dollar relative to certain
other currencies. In 2001, cocoa bean prices have been higher than in 2000.

     The prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in the
products of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods International generally
reflect external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market
fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural
programs. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to
fluctuate as a result of these factors, the Company believes such raw materials
to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. However,
the Company and its subsidiaries use hedging techniques to minimize the impact
of price fluctuations in their principal raw materials. They do not fully hedge
against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect the
Company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs.

                                   Regulation

     All of Kraft Foods North America's United States food products and
packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") or, with respect to products containing meat and poultry,
the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA"). Among other things, these
agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated
foods, establish safety standards for food processing, establish ingredients and
manufacturing procedures for certain foods, establish standards of identity for
certain foods, determine the safety of food additives and establish labeling
standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products.

     In addition, various states regulate the business of Kraft Foods North
America's operating units by licensing dairy plants, enforcing federal and state
standards of identity for selected food products, grading food products,
inspecting plants, regulating certain trade practices in connection with the
sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food
products.

     Many of the food commodities on which Kraft Foods North America's United
States businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs. These
programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to
Congressional and administrative review.

     Almost all of the activities of the Company's food operations outside of
the United States are subject to local and national regulations similar to those
applicable to Kraft Foods North America's United States businesses and, in some
cases, international regulatory provisions, such as those of the European Union
relating to labeling, packaging, food content, pricing, marketing and
advertising and related areas.

     The European Union and certain individual countries require that food
products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients
derived from them be labeled accordingly. Other countries may adopt similar
regulations. The FDA has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory
labeling under current United States law.

                                 Other Matters

Customers

     For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company's five largest customers
accounted for approximately 26% of its operating revenues while the Company's
ten largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of its operating revenues.
One of the Company's customers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., accounted for
approximately 10.1% of operating revenues for 2001.

Employees

     At December 31, 2001, the Company employed approximately 114,000 people
worldwide. Approximately one-half of the Company's 30,000 hourly employees in
the United States are represented by labor unions. Most of the unionized workers
at the Company's domestic locations are represented under contracts with the
Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union;
the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union; and the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These contracts expire at various times
throughout the next several years. Outside the United States, approximately 70%
of the Company's 40,000 hourly employees are represented by labor unions or
workers' councils. The Company's business units are subject to a number of laws
and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws
and regulations are specific to the location of each enterprise. In addition, in
accordance with European Union requirements, Kraft Foods International has
established European Works Councils composed of management and elected members
of its workforce. The Company and its subsidiaries believe that their relations
with employees and their representative organizations are good.

                                        8
<PAGE>

Research and Development

     The Company pursues four objectives in research and development:
uncompromising product safety and quality; growth through new products; superior
consumer satisfaction; and reduced costs.

     The Company's research and development resources include more than 2,000
food scientists, chemists and engineers, deployed primarily in five key
technology centers: East Hanover, New Jersey; Glenview, Illinois; Tarrytown, New
York; Banbury, United Kingdom and Munich, Germany. These technology centers are
equipped with pilot plants and state-of-the-art instruments. Research and
development expense was $358 million in 2001, $270 million in 2000 and $262
million in 1999.

Trademarks and Intellectual Property

     Trademarks are of material importance to the Company's businesses and are
protected by registration or otherwise in the United States and most other
markets where the related products are sold. The Company has from time to time
granted various parties exclusive or non-exclusive licenses to use one or more
of its trademarks in particular locations. The Company does not believe that
these licensing arrangements have had a material effect on the conduct of its
business or operating results.

     Some of the Company's products are sold under brands that have been
licensed from others on terms that are generally renewable at the Company's
discretion. These licensed brands include Starbucks bagged coffee for sale in
United States grocery stores, Capri Sun aseptic juice drinks for sale in North
America, Taco Bell Mexican style food products for sale in United States grocery
stores, Pebbles ready-to-eat cereals and Breyers yogurt products.

     Similarly, the Company and its subsidiaries own thousands of patents
worldwide, and the patent portfolio as a whole is material to the Company's
business; however, no one patent or group of related patents is material to the
Company. In addition, the Company has proprietary trade secrets, technology,
know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not
registered.

Environmental Regulation

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state,
local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials
into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection,
including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as "Superfund"), which imposes joint and
several liability on each responsible party. In 2001, subsidiaries of the
Company were involved in 91 active Superfund and other actions in the United
States related to current operations and certain former or divested operations
for which the Company retains liability.

     Outside the United States, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and regulations
in the host countries in which the Company does business. The Company has
specific programs across its international business units designed to meet
compliance requirements in the environmental area.

     Although it is not possible to predict precisely the estimated costs for
such environmental-related expenditures, compliance with such laws and
regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs and the making of
such expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations, capital expenditures, financial
position, earnings or competitive position.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

     The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or
oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in its reports to
shareholders. One can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words
such as "strategy," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will,"
"estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of
similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. In connection with the "safe harbor"
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company
is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results and
outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statement made by or on behalf of the Company; any such statement is qualified
by reference to the following cautionary statements.

     Each of the Company's segments is subject to intense competition, changes
in consumer preferences, the effects of changing prices for its raw materials
and local economic conditions. Their results are dependent upon their continued
ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new
consumer trends, to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand
portfolios in order to compete effectively with lower priced products in a
consolidating environment at the retail and manufacturing levels, to improve
productivity, and to respond to changing prices for raw materials. The Company's
results are also dependent on its ability to successfully integrate and derive
cost savings from the integration of Nabisco's operations with the Company. In
addition, the Company is subject to the effects of foreign economies, currency
movements and fluctuations in levels of customer inventories. The food industry
continues to be subject to the possibility that consumers could lose confidence
in the safety and quality of certain food products. Developments in any of these
areas could cause the Company's results to differ materially from results that
have been or may be projected by or on behalf of the Company. The Company
cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. The
Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be
made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.

(d) Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

     The amounts of operating revenues and long-lived assets attributable to
each of the Company's geographic segments for each of the last three fiscal

condition, and the Company believes that they are suitable and adequate for its
present needs.

     The integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company has resulted
in the closure of seven Nabisco facilities during 2001. During 2002, the Company
anticipates closing seven additional Nabisco facilities.

     As of December 31, 2001, the Company's distribution facilities consisted of
459 distribution centers and depots worldwide. In North America, the Company had
397 distribution centers and depots, more than 75% of which support the
Company's direct-store-delivery systems. Outside North America, the Company had
62 distribution centers and depots in 27 countries. The Company owns 89 of these
distribution centers and two of these depots and leases 173 of these
distribution centers and 195 of these depots. The Company believes that all of
these facilities are in good condition and have sufficient capacity to meet the
Company's distribution needs for the foreseeable future.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

     The Company's subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings
arising out of the normal course of business, including the matters discussed
below. While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial
position.

     National Cheese Exchange Cases:  Since 1996, seven putative class actions
have been filed by various dairy farmers alleging that the Company and others
engaged in a conspiracy to fix and depress the prices of bulk cheese and milk
through their trading activity on the National Cheese Exchange. Plaintiffs seek
injunctive and equitable relief and unspecified treble damages. Two of the
actions were voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs after class certification was
denied. Three cases were consolidated in state court in Wisconsin, and in
November 1999, the court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment. In
June 2001, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling, but
on October 23, 2001, the Wisconsin Supreme Court granted plaintiffs' petition
for further review. The Company's motion to dismiss was granted in a case
pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for
further proceedings. A case in Illinois state court has been settled and
dismissed. No classes have been certified in any of the cases.

     Environmental Matters:  In May 2001, the State of Ohio notified the Company
that it may be subject to an enforcement action for alleged past violations of
the Company's wastewater discharge permit at its production facility in
Farmdale, Ohio. The State has offered to attempt to negotiate a settlement of
this matter, and the Company has accepted the offer to do so. The State has not
yet identified the relief it may seek in this matter.

     In December 2001, the Company settled a civil enforcement action in which
the State of Missouri alleged that the Company had violated state solid waste
and clean water laws in its handling of spent wiener casings. The Company paid a
civil penalty of $300,000 and completed remediation of the site where the spent
casings had been sent.

     The Company is potentially liable for certain environmental matters arising
from the operations of Nabisco's former wholly-owned subsidiary, Rowe
Industries. Rowe operated a small engine manufacturing facility in Sag Harbor,
New York in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s that used various solvents. About
20 homes downgradient from the site were connected to public drinking water in
the mid-1980s after solvents were detected in their individual wells. Since
1996, three toxic tort cases have been brought against Nabisco in New York state
court, collectively by or on behalf of approximately 80 individuals, including
17 minors. The first case was filed on March 6, 1996, in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York and was subsequently dismissed by the trial court. That
decision was affirmed on appeal. The other two cases both were filed on January
3, 2000, also in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. That court granted
defendant's summary judgment motion as to all but one of the plaintiffs in each
of the remaining cases, and the plaintiffs have now withdrawn their appeal of
this ruling. Discovery is proceeding as to the two remaining plaintiffs, who are
seeking unspecified damages for alleged personal injury and fear or risk of
cancer.

     The Company is also potentially liable for certain environmental matters
arising from Nabisco's or a former affiliate's connection with Del Monte
Corporation in the 1970s and 1980s. Del Monte Corporation operated a plantation
on Oahu, Hawaii, which used various pesticides for crop application over an
extended time period. A pesticide spill at the site led to the closure of nearby
drinking water wells and an investigation, under the oversight of the United
States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), of soil and groundwater
contamination associated with the site. Upon completion of this investigation,
the EPA will select a plan to remedy the contamination.

     In addition, two lawsuits were filed in 1999 against Del Monte Corporation
and approximately six other Oahu growers and pesticide manufacturers seeking
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for alleged pesticide
contamination of drinking water supplies. The Board of Water Supply of the City
and County of Honolulu filed the first lawsuit on September 27, 1999 in the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit of the State of Hawaii. This case was settled
and dismissed by the court in January 2002. The second lawsuit, which was filed
on October 7, 1999 in the same court, was brought by numerous area residents
alleging bodily injury, emotional distress and wrongful death. This case remains
pending. In June 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party,
under which the third party will fully indemnify the Company for the Hawaii
matters described above.

     Twelve lawsuits recently were filed against Del Monte Corporation (which
previously was affiliated with Nabisco or a former affiliate) and 6 other
pesticide users and manufacturers for alleged injuries to workers caused by
exposure to dibromochloropropane ("DBCP"). The complaints were served on Del
Monte Corporation on approximately February 21, 2002. The complaints allege that
Del Monte Corporation purchased DBCP in mid-1979 with the objective of using it
in Nicaragua. The lawsuits, which were instituted between September 17, 2001 and
October 1, 2001 with the Third Civil District Judge for Managua (Nicaragua),
collectively seek unspecified costs and expenses and compensatory and punitive
damages of approximately $720 million. The Company has sought full defense and
indemnity from a third party for each of these claims.

The value of any Subaccount at any relevant time shall be determined as if all
amounts credited thereto had been invested in the corresponding Fund.

         2.2.3 Investment Directions

Each Participant shall make an investment direction on his or her Initial
Election Form with respect to the portion of such Participant's Deferred Amount
that is to be allocated to a Subaccount. Any apportionment of Deferred Amounts
(and of increases or decreases in Deferred Amounts) among the Subaccounts shall
be in integral multiples of one percent (1%). An investment direction shall
become effective with respect to any Subaccount on the first day of the calendar
month following the Election Date of such Election Form. An investment direction
shall remain in effect with respect to all future Deferred Amounts until a new
investment direction made by the Participant in accordance with Section 2.2.4
becomes effective.

         2.2.4 New Investment Directions

A Participant may make a new investment direction with respect to his or her
Deferred Amount only by submitting a Modified Election Form to the Secretary of
the Company. A new investment direction shall become effective with respect to
any Subaccount on the first day of the calendar month following the Election
Date of such Modified Election Form.

         2.2.5 Investment Transfers

<PAGE>
A Participant may transfer to one or more different Subaccounts all or a part
(in integral multiples of one percent (1%)) of the amounts credited to a
Subaccount by submitting a Transfer Form to the Secretary of the Company;
provided however that no Transfer Form with respect to a transfer affecting
Subaccount D may be submitted by a Participant if a Transfer Form requesting an
opposite way transfer with respect to Subaccount D had been submitted by such

         a. the first day of the calendar month following the date of
            termination of the Participant's service as a member of the
            Board; or

         b. the first day of a calendar month specified by the Participant
            which is at least six months after the Election Date.

A Distribution Date election shall become effective on the Election Date of such
Initial Election Form.

All distributions shall be paid in a lump sum in cash.

         2.3.2 Modified Distribution Elections

A Participant may modify his or her election as to the Distribution Date with

the Participant.

An extraordinary distribution shall be made with respect to amounts credited to
each Subaccount on the first day of the calendar month next following approval
of the extraordinary distribution request by the Board; provided, however, that
no extraordinary distribution shall be made from Subaccount D if a Transfer Form
pursuant to Section 2.2.5 requesting an opposite way transfer with respect to
Subaccount D had been submitted by such Participant within the preceding six
months.

SECTION 3. General Provisions

3.1 Unfunded Plan

It is intended that the Plan constitute an "unfunded" plan for deferred
compensation. The Company may authorize the creation of trusts or other
arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan; provided, however,
that, unless the Company otherwise determines, the existence of such trusts or
other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.

3.2 Rules of Construction

Headings are given to the sections of the Plan solely as a convenience to
facilitate reference. The reference to any statute, regulation, or other
provision of law shall be construed to refer to any amendment to or successor of
such provision of law.

3.3 Withholding

No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the
gross income of the Participant for Federal income tax purposes under the Plan,
the Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to
the Company regarding the payment of, any Federal, state, local or foreign taxes
of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount.

<PAGE>
3.4 Amendment

The Plan may be amended by the Board, but no amendment shall be made that would
impair prior rights of a Participant to his or her Deferred Fee Account without
his or her consent. No amendment may become effective until shareholder approval
is obtained if the amendment (i) materially increases the benefits accruing to
Participants under the Plan, or (ii) modifies the eligibility requirements for
participation in the Plan.

3.5 Duration of Plan

The Company hopes to continue the Plan indefinitely, but reserves the right to
terminate the Plan by appropriate action of the Board at any time. Upon
termination of the Plan, amounts then credited to each Deferred Fee Account

Fee Account or as otherwise provided in Section 2.3.1.

3.6 Assignability

No Participant or Beneficiary shall have the right to assign, pledge or
otherwise transfer any payments to which such Participant or Beneficiary may be
entitled under the Plan, other than by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order which meets the relevant
requirements of a "qualified domestic relations order" (as defined by Section
414(p) of the Code).

3.7 Adoption of Procedures

The Secretary of the Company shall have the authority to adopt such procedures
as are appropriate to administer the Plan.

3.8 Construction

The Plan shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with Virginia law. The

                                Kraft Foods Inc.


Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft"), together with its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as the "Company") is the largest branded food and beverage company
headquartered in the United States. Prior to June 13, 2001, the Company was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip Morris Companies Inc. ("Philip Morris"). On
June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of
280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00 per share.
The IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and expenses, of $8.4 billion
were used to retire a portion of an $11.0 billion long-term note payable to
Philip Morris incurred in connection with the acquisition of Nabisco Holdings
Corp. ("Nabisco"). After the IPO, Philip Morris owns approximately 83.9% of the
outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock through its ownership of 49.5%
of the Company's Class A common stock, and 100% of the Company's Class B common
stock. The Company's Class A common stock has one vote per share while the
Company's Class B common stock has ten votes per share. Therefore, Philip Morris
holds 97.7% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding common
stock.

The Company conducts its global business through two units: Kraft Foods North
America, Inc. ("KFNA") and Kraft Foods International, Inc. ("KFI"). KFNA manages
its operations by product category, while KFI manages its operations by
geographic region. KFNA's segments are Cheese, Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits,
Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages, Desserts and Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and
Pizza. KFNA's food service business within the United States and its businesses
in Canada and Mexico are reported through the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers
segment. KFI's segments are Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin America
and Asia Pacific.

Financial Reporting Release No. 60, which was recently issued by the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), requires all registrants to discuss critical
accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements.
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
Company's consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the
Company does not have any individual accounting policy which is critical to the
preparation of its consolidated financial statements. This is due principally to
the definitive nature of accounting requirements for consumer products
companies. Also, in most instances, the Company must use an accounting policy or
method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The
following is a review of the more significant accounting policies and methods
used by the Company:

Revenue Recognition: As required by U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes operating
revenues upon shipment of products to customers when title and risk of loss pass
to its customers. Provisions and allowances for sales returns and bad debts are
also recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The amounts
recorded for these provisions and related allowances are not significant to the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002,
the Company will adopt new required accounting standards mandating that certain
costs currently reported as marketing, administration and research costs be
shown as a reduction of operating revenues or an increase in cost of sales. As a
result, previously reported revenues will be reduced by approximately $4.6
billion, $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The adoption of the new accounting standards will have no impact on net earnings
or basic or diluted earnings per share.

Depreciation and Amortization: The Company depreciates property, plant and
equipment and amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets using straight-line
methods. Through December 31, 2001, the Company used forty years to amortize
goodwill and other intangible assets, in recognition of the strength of its
brands, which resulted in amortization expense of $962 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Beginning on January 1, 2002, with the adoption of a
new required accounting standard, the Company will no longer be required to
amortize a substantial portion of its goodwill and other intangible assets. As a
result, the Company estimates that amortization expense will approximate $10
million for the year ending December 31, 2002. The Company will also be required
to continue to review annually its goodwill and other intangible assets for
possible impairment or loss of value. However, the Company does not currently
anticipate having to record an impairment loss when it adopts the new standard.

Marketing Costs: As required by U.S. GAAP, the Company records marketing costs
as an expense in the year to which such costs relate. The Company does not defer
the recognition of any amounts on its consolidated balance sheet with respect to
marketing costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in the
period in which the related advertisement initially appears. The Company records
consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as an expense in the period in
which these programs are offered, based on estimates of utilization and
redemption rates that are developed from historical information. As discussed
above under "Revenue Recognition," beginning January 1, 2002, the Company will
adopt the previously mentioned revenue recognition accounting standards
mandating that certain costs currently reported as marketing expense be shown as
a reduction of operating revenues or an increase in cost of sales. As a result,
previously reported amounts for marketing, administration and research costs
will be reduced by approximately $4.7 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion for
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The adoption of the new accounting standards
will have no impact on net earnings or basic or diluted earnings per share.

Hedging Instruments: As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions
of a new required accounting standard, which did not have a material effect on
net earnings (less than $1 million) or accumulated other comprehensive losses
(less than $1 million). The new accounting standard requires that the fair value
of all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the Company's
consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. Substantially all of the
Company's derivative financial instruments are effective as hedges under the new
standard; accordingly, the changes in their

                                       22
<PAGE>
                                Kraft Foods Inc.

fair value are recognized in earnings when the related hedged items are recorded
in earnings. During 2001, the Company recognized deferred losses of $15 million
in earnings, which offset the impact of gains on the related hedged items. In
Note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the Company has
included a detailed discussion of the types of exposures that it periodically
hedges, as well as a summary of the various instruments which it utilizes. The
Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Employee Benefit Plans: The Company and its subsidiaries provide a range of
benefits to their employees and retired employees, including pensions,
postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits (primarily
severance). The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on
calculations specified by U.S. GAAP, which include various actuarial
assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation
increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews
its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the
assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to
do so. As required by U.S. GAAP, the effect of the modifications is generally
recorded or amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the
assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans, which are
presented in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, are reasonable
based on its experience and advice from its actuaries.

Related Party Transactions: As discussed in Note 3 to the Company's consolidated
financial statements, Philip Morris and certain of its affiliates provide the
Company with various services, including planning, legal, treasury, accounting
and financial services, auditing, insurance, human resources, office of the
secretary, corporate affairs, information technology and tax services. Billings
for these services were $339 million in 2001, $248 million in 2000 and $165
million in 1999. The increases reflect information services and financial
services that were previously performed by the Company, but are now provided by
Philip Morris at approximately the same cost. Although the value of services
provided by Philip Morris cannot be quantified on a stand-alone basis,
management believes that the billings are reasonable based on the level of
support provided by Philip Morris, and that the charges reflect all services
provided.

The Company also has long-term notes payable to Philip Morris of $5.0 billion at
December 31, 2001 and $21.4 billion at December 31, 2000. A significant portion
of the amount outstanding at December 31, 2000 related to borrowings for the
acquisition of Nabisco. The decrease from 2000 to 2001 reflects the repayment of
borrowings with proceeds from the IPO, a public global bond offering and
short-term borrowings. The interest rates on the debt with Philip Morris were
established at market rates available to Philip Morris at the time of issuance
for similar debt with matching maturities. However, the $5.0 billion remaining
long-term note payable to Philip Morris has no prepayment penalty, and the
Company may repay some or all of the note with the proceeds from external debt
offerings in the current low interest rate environment.

In addition,the accounts of the Company are included in the consolidated federal
income tax return of Philip Morris. To the extent that foreign tax credits,
capital losses and other credits generated by the Company, which cannot be
utilized on a stand-alone basis,are utilized in Philip Morris' consolidated
federal income tax return,the benefit is recognized in the Company's calculation
of its provision for income taxes. The Company's provisions for income taxes for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were lower than provisions
calculated on a stand-alone basis by $185 million, $139 million and
$107 million, respectively.

                    ---------------------------------------

The preparation of all financial statements includes the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the Company's financial
statements, including, among other things, employee benefit costs and related
disclosures, inventories under the last-in-first-out ("LIFO") method, marketing
costs (advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions), environmental
costs and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience
and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are
ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the
Company's results for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between the Company's estimates
and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

Business Environment

The Company is subject to fluctuating commodity costs, currency movements and
competitive challenges in various product categories and markets, including a
trend toward increasing consolidation in the retail trade and consequent
inventory reductions and changing consumer preferences. Certain competitors may
have different profit objectives and some international competitors may be less
susceptible to currency exchange rates. To confront these challenges, the
Company continues to take steps to build the value of its brands and improve its
food business portfolio with new products and marketing initiatives.

Fluctuations in commodity costs can cause retail price volatility, intensify
price competition and influence consumer and trade buying patterns. KFNA's and
KFI's businesses are subject to fluctuating commodity costs, including dairy,
coffee bean and cocoa costs. Dairy commodity costs on average have been higher
in 2001 than those seen in 2000. Cocoa bean prices have also been higher, while
coffee bean prices have been lower than in 2000. During the latter part of 2000
and into 2001, energy costs rose in response to higher prices charged for oil
and natural gas. However, this increase in energy costs did not have a material
adverse effect on the operating results of the Company.

                                       23

                                Kraft Foods Inc.

On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Nabisco for $55 per share in cash. The purchase of the outstanding shares,
retirement of employee stock options and other payments totaled approximately
$15.2 billion. In addition, the acquisition included the assumption of
approximately $4.0 billion of existing Nabisco debt. The Company financed the
acquisition through the issuance of two long-term notes payable to Philip Morris
totaling $15.0 billion and short-term intercompany borrowings of $255 million.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. Nabisco's balance sheet
was consolidated with the Company as of December 31, 2000, and beginning January
1, 2001, Nabisco's earnings have been included in the consolidated operating
results of the Company; however, Nabisco's earnings from December 11, 2000 to
December 31, 2000 were not included in the consolidated operating results of the
Company since such amounts were insignificant. The Company's interest cost
associated with acquiring Nabisco has been included in interest and other debt
expense, net, on the Company's consolidated statements of earnings for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

The integration of Nabisco into Kraft has continued throughout 2001. The closure
of a number of Nabisco domestic and international facilities resulted in
severance and other exit costs of $379 million, which are included in the
adjustments for the allocation of purchase price. The closures will result in
the termination of approximately 7,500 employees and will require total cash
payments of $373 million, of which approximately $74 million has been spent
through December 31, 2001. Substantially all of the closures will be completed
by the end of 2002.

The integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company will also result
in the closure or reconfiguration of several of the Company's existing
facilities. The aggregate charges to the Company's consolidated statement of
earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and integrate Nabisco are
estimated to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. During 2001, the
Company incurred pre-tax integration costs of $53 million for site
reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the United States.

During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and
Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland. The
total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $194 million. The
operating results of these businesses were not material to the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations in any of the periods
presented.

During 2000, the Company purchased the outstanding common stock of Balance Bar
Co., a maker of energy and nutrition snack products. In a separate transaction,
the Company also acquired Boca Burger, Inc., a privately held manufacturer and
marketer of soy-based meat alternatives. The total cost of these and other
smaller acquisitions was $365 million. The operating results of these businesses
were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operations in any of the periods presented.

During 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company sold several small businesses, including
a French confectionery business in 2000. The aggregate proceeds received in
these transactions during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $21 million, $300 million and
$175 million, respectively, on which pre-tax gains of $8 million, $172 million
and $62 million, respectively, were recorded. The operating results of
businesses divested were not material to the consolidated operating results of
the Company in any of the periods presented.

Euro: Twelve of the fifteen member countries of the European Union have
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and one
common currency--the euro. In January 2002, the new euro-denominated currency
(bills and coins) was issued. The Company's operating subsidiaries affected by
the euro conversion have addressed the systems and business issues raised by the
euro currency conversion. These issues included, among others: (1) the need to
adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate
euro-denominated transactions; and (2) the competitive impact of cross-border
price transparency, which makes it more difficult for businesses to charge
different prices for the same products on a country-by-country basis. The euro
conversion has not had, and the Company currently anticipates that it will not
have, a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of
operations.

Century Date Change: The Company did not experience any material disruptions to
its business as a result of the Century Date Change ("CDC"). The Company's
increases in 1999 year-end inventories and trade receivables caused by
preemptive CDC contingency plans resulted in incremental cash outflows during
1999 of approximately $155 million. The cash outflows reversed in the first
quarter of 2000. In addition, the Company had increased shipments in the fourth
quarter of 1999 because customers purchased additional product in anticipation
of potential CDC- related disruptions. The increased shipments in 1999 resulted
in estimated incremental operating revenues and operating companies income in
1999 of approximately $97 million and $40 million, respectively, and
corresponding decreases in operating revenues and operating companies income in
2000.

53rd Week and Trade Inventory Reductions: The Company's subsidiaries end their
fiscal years on the last Saturday in December. Accordingly, most years contain
52 weeks of operating results while every fifth or sixth year includes 53 weeks.
The Company's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31,
2000 included a 53rd week. The benefit to 2000 operating results from an extra
week of shipments was partially offset by inventory reductions undertaken by
trade customers for certain of the Company's products. A reduction in trade
inventories also occurred in 2001. The net result is that Kraft's 2001 volume
and revenue comparisons to 2000 were affected by the extra week of shipments in
2000. Volume comparisons contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis for
2001 versus 2000 have been provided on a comparable 52-week basis to provide a
more meaningful comparison of operating results.

<PAGE>
                                Kraft Foods Inc.

Separation Programs: In October 2001, the Company announced that it was offering
a voluntary retirement program to certain salaried employees in the United
States. The program is expected to terminate approximately 750 employees and
will result in an estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $140 million upon
final employee acceptance in the first quarter of 2002. This pre-tax charge is
part of the previously discussed $200 million to $300 million in pre-tax charges
related to the integration of Nabisco.

During 1999, KFNA offered voluntary retirement incentive or separation programs
to certain eligible hourly and salaried employees in the United States.
Employees electing to terminate employment under the terms of these programs
were entitled to enhanced retirement or severance benefits. Approximately 1,100
hourly and salaried employees accepted the benefits offered by these programs
and elected to retire or terminate. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $157 million in 1999. This charge was included in marketing,
administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for
the following segments: Cheese, Meals and Enhancers, $71 million; Oscar Mayer
and Pizza, $38 million; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery, $2 million; and
Beverages, Desserts and Cereals, $46 million. Payments of pension and
postretirement benefits are made in accordance with the terms of the applicable
benefit plans. Severance benefits, which were paid over a period of time,
commenced upon dates of termination, which ranged from April 1999 to March 2000.
The program and related payments were completed during 2000. Salary and related
benefit costs of employees prior to their retirement or termination date were
expensed as incurred.

Consolidated Operating Results

The acquisition of Nabisco and subsequent IPO were significant events that
affect the comparability of earnings. In order to isolate the financial effects
of these events, and to provide a more meaningful comparison of the Company's
results of operations, the following tables and the subsequent discussion of the
Company's consolidated operating results refer to results on a reported,
underlying and pro forma basis. Reported results include the operating results
of Nabisco in 2001, but not in 2000 and 1999. Reported results also reflect
average shares of common stock outstanding during 2001, and reflect an average
of 1.455 billion shares outstanding during 2000 and 1999. Underlying results
include the operating results of Nabisco in 2001, but not in 2000 and 1999, and
adjust for certain unusual items as detailed on the tables, such as results from
operations divested since the beginning of 1999. Pro forma results assume the
Company owned Nabisco for all of 2000. In addition, pro forma results reflect
common shares outstanding of 1.735 billion based on the assumption that shares
issued immediately following the IPO were outstanding during 2001 and 2000, and
that, effective January 1, 2000, the net proceeds of the IPO were used to retire
a portion of a long-term note payable used to finance the Nabisco acquisition.
Pro forma results also adjust for certain unusual items as detailed on the
tables, such as the results from operations divested since the beginning of
2000.

2001 compared with 2000

Reported volume for 2001 increased 4,262 million pounds (32.5%) over 2000, due
primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco. Pro forma volume increased 2.5% over
2000. Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000, volume increased 3.7%,
reflecting new product introductions and volume gains in developing markets.

Reported operating revenues for 2001 increased $7,343 million (27.7%) over 2000,
due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco. Pro forma operating revenues
decreased slightly from 2000, due primarily to the 53rd week of sales in 2000,
the adverse effect of currency exchange rates and lower sales prices on coffee
products (driven by commodity-related price declines), partially offset by the
favorable impact of volume growth.

Reported operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before
general corporate expenses and amortization of goodwill and other intangible
assets, was affected by the following unusual items during 2001 and 2000:

- -    Sale of Food Factory and Integration Costs: During 2001, the Company
     recorded pre-tax charges of $53 million for site reconfigurations and other
     consolidation programs in the United States. In addition, the Company
     recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million related to the sale of a North
     American food factory. These pre-tax charges, which aggregate $82 million,
     were included in marketing, administration and research costs in the
     consolidated statement of earnings for the following segments: Cheese,
     Meals and Enhancers, $63 million; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery, $2
     million; Beverages, Desserts and Cereals, $12 million; and Oscar Mayer and
     Pizza, $5 million.

- -    Sale of French Confectionery Business: During 2000, the Company sold a
     French confectionery business ("French Confectionery Sale") for proceeds of
     $251 million on which a pre-tax gain of $139 million was recorded. The
     pre-tax gain is included in the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment's
     marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement
     of earnings.

The operating companies income comparison was also affected by approximately $40
million of operating income from the previously mentioned CDC sales.

Reported operating companies income increased $1,280 million (26.9%) over 2000,
due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma basis, operating
companies income increased $500 million (8.9%), driven by volume growth,
productivity savings and Nabisco synergies, partially offset by unfavorable
currency movements.

Currency movements have decreased operating revenues by $522 million and
operating companies income by $60 million from 2000. Decreases in operating
revenues and operating companies income are due to the strength of the U.S.
dollar against the euro, Canadian dollar and certain Asian and Latin American
currencies. Although the Company cannot predict future movements in currency
exchange rates, the strength of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the euro and
Asian currencies, if sustained during 2002, could continue to have an
unfavorable impact on operating revenues and operating companies income
comparisons.

Reported interest and other debt expense, net, increased $840 million in 2001.
This increase was due primarily to notes issued to Philip Morris in the fourth
quarter of 2000 to finance the acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma basis,
interest and other debt expense, net, decreased $213 million in 2001 from $1,348
million in 2000. This decrease in pro forma interest expense is due to the use
of free cash flow to repay debt and ongoing efforts to externally refinance debt
payable to Philip Morris in the current low interest rate environment.

                                Kraft Foods Inc.

During 2001, the Company's reported effective tax rate increased by 4.0
percentage points to 45.4% as compared with 2000, due primarily to higher
Nabisco-related goodwill amortization, which is not tax deductible.

Reported diluted and basic earnings per share ("EPS"), which were both $1.17 for
2001, decreased by 15.2% from 2000, due primarily to higher levels of goodwill
amortization and interest expense associated with the acquisition of Nabisco.
Reported net earnings of $1,882 million for 2001 decreased $119 million (5.9%)
from 2000. On a pro forma basis, diluted and basic EPS, which were both $1.21
for 2001, increased by 19.8% over 2000, due primarily to higher operating
results in all segments. Pro forma net earnings of $2,092 million for 2001
increased $347 million (19.9%) from 2000.

2000 compared with 1999

Reported volume for 2000 increased 313 million pounds (2.4%) over 1999. Reported
volume in 2000 benefited from the inclusion of 53 weeks in 2000 operating
results, partially offset by a decrease related to trade inventory reductions in
the United States. Volume increased in every segment except Cheese, Meals and
Enhancers, where a decrease in lower-margin food service products more than
offset volume increases in higher margin products. On an underlying basis,
volume increased 4.1%.

Reported operating revenues for 2000 decreased $265 million (1.0%) from 1999,
due primarily to unfavorable currency movements ($857 million), the estimated
shift in CDC revenues ($194 million) and revenues from divested businesses,
partially offset by higher volume/mix ($756 million), the impact of acquisitions
($148 million) and higher pricing ($49 million). On an underlying basis,
operating revenues increased 0.5%.

Reported operating companies income for 2000 increased $502 million (11.8%) over
1999, due primarily to higher volume/mix ($387 million), higher margins ($402
million, due primarily to price increases and lower commodity and manufacturing
costs), 1999 separation charges ($157 million) and the gain on the French
Confectionery Sale in 2000 ($139 million), partially offset by higher marketing
expenses ($366 million), unfavorable currency movements ($91 million), the shift
in CDC income ($80 million) and the impact of divested businesses. On an
underlying basis, operating companies income increased 7.2%.

Interest and other debt expense, net, increased $58 million (10.8%), due
primarily to the notes issued to Philip Morris in connection with the
acquisition of Nabisco.

During 2000, the Company's reported effective tax rate decreased 0.9 percentage
points to 41.4%. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in state and
local income taxes resulting from the mix of pre-tax earnings in various states.

Reported net earnings in 2000 increased $248 million (14.1%) and 2000 basic and
diluted earnings per share each increased by 15.0%. On an underlying basis, net
earnings of $1.9 billion increased 6.6% over $1.8 billion in 1999, and basic and
diluted earnings per share each grew 7.2% from $1.25 in 1999 to $1.34 in 2000.

2001 compared with 2000

KFNA's reported volume for 2001 increased 31.7% over 2000, due primarily to the
acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma basis, volume for 2001 increased 2.1%, or
3.4% excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000. The increase was due
primarily to higher shipments across all segments and reflects contributions
from new products.

Reported operating revenues increased $6.6 billion (36.0%) over 2000, due
primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($6.6 billion) and the shift in CDC
revenues ($71 million), partially offset by unfavorable currency movements ($62
million). On a pro forma basis, operating revenues increased 0.8%, due primarily
to higher revenues from the Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery segment and the
Oscar Mayer and Pizza segment, partially offset by the impact of the 53rd week
in 2000.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 increased $1,249 million (35.2%)
over 2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($1.2 billion), lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($177 million) and the shift in CDC
income ($27 million), partially offset by lower margins ($39 million, driven by
higher dairy commodity-related costs) and the loss on the sale of a North
American food factory and integration costs ($82 million). On a pro forma basis,
operating companies income increased 9.0%.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFNA's reportable
segments.

Cheese, Meals and Enhancers: Reported volume in 2001 increased 8.3% over 2000,
due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma basis, volume in
2001 decreased 0.6% due primarily to the 53rd week of shipments in 2000.
Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000, volume increased 0.9%, as volume
gains in meals, enhancers and Canada were partially offset by declines in cheese
and food services. Meals recorded volume gains, reflecting higher shipments of
macaroni & cheese dinners. Enhancers also recorded volume gains, reflecting
higher shipments of spoonable and pourable dressings. In Canada, volume grew on
higher shipments of branded products. In cheese, shipments decreased due
primarily to the Company's decision to exit the lower-margin, non-branded cheese
business. Volume also declined in process cheese loaves and cream cheese, as
retailers continued to reduce trade inventory levels, partially offset by higher
volume in grated and natural cheese. In U.S. food service, shipments declined
due to weakness in the economy and the Company's exit from lower-margin
businesses.

During 2001, reported operating revenues increased $851 million (9.0%) over
2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($861 million), higher pricing
($89 million, primarily related to higher dairy commodity costs) and the shift
in CDC revenues ($34 million), partially offset by lower volume/mix ($65
million) and unfavorable currency movements ($62 million). On a pro forma basis,
operating revenues decreased slightly from the comparable period of 2000, as
unfavorable currency and lower volume/mix were partially offset by higher
pricing in cheese and food service.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 increased $254 million (13.8%) over
2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($234 million), lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($173 million, primarily lower
marketing expense) and the shift in CDC income ($15 million), partially offset
by unfavorable margins due to higher dairy commodity costs ($81 million) and the
loss on the sale of a North American food factory and integration costs ($63
million). Marketing expense decreased due to lower price promotions on cheese
products as cheese commodity costs increased. This followed a period of heavy
price promotion in 2000, when low cheese commodity costs drove a period of
intense price competition. On a pro forma basis, operating companies income
increased 5.1%.

Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery: Reported volume in 2001 increased more than
100% over 2000, due to the acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma basis, volume
in 2001 increased 1.5% over 2000. Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000,
volume increased 1.6%, due primarily to new product introductions in biscuits,
partially offset by lower shipments of snack nuts.

During 2001, reported operating revenues increased $5.6 billion or more than
100% over 2000, due to the acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma basis,
operating revenues increased 2.7%, due primarily to higher volume driven by new
biscuit products and higher pricing of biscuit and confectionery products.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 increased $866 million, or more
than 100% over 2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($925 million),
partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs ($39
million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies income increased 24.6%, due
primarily to higher volume from new biscuit products, lower commodity costs for
snack nuts, and productivity and Nabisco synergy savings.

Beverages, Desserts and Cereals: Reported volume in 2001 increased 9.8% over
2000, due primarily to growth in beverages. On a pro forma basis, volume in 2001
increased 7.7% over 2000. Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000, volume
increased 9.3%, due primarily to increased shipments of ready-to-drink
beverages, benefiting from the introduction of new products. Desserts volume was
below the prior year due to lower shipments of dry packaged desserts and frozen
toppings. Cereal volume declined due primarily to weak category performance and
increased competition in the ready-to-eat cereal category.

During 2001, reported operating revenues increased $104 million (2.0%) over
2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($93 million), the acquisition
of Balance Bar Co. ($20 million), the shift in CDC revenues ($22 million) and
higher volume/mix ($17 million), partially offset by lower pricing ($49 million,
due primarily to coffee commodity-related price reductions). On a pro forma
basis, operating revenues decreased 0.5%, reflecting commodity-related price
reductions on coffee products and lower shipments in desserts and cereals.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 increased $102 million (9.4%) over
2000, primarily reflecting higher margins ($87 million), the acquisition of
Nabisco ($32 million), lower marketing, administration and research costs ($21
million) and the shift in CDC income ($7 million), partially offset by
integration costs ($12 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies
income increased 7.0%.

Oscar Mayer and Pizza: Reported volume in 2001 increased 0.8% over 2000.
Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000, volume increased 2.3%, due to
volume gains in processed meats and pizza. The processed meats business recorded
volume gains in luncheon meats, hot dogs, bacon and soy-based meat alternatives.
Volume in the pizza business increased, driven by new products.

During 2001, reported operating revenues increased $102 million (2.9%) over 2000
due primarily to higher volume/mix ($75 million), the shift in CDC revenues ($12
million) and the acquisition of Boca Burger, Inc.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 increased $27 million (5.3%) over
2000 primarily reflecting higher volume/mix ($45 million), lower marketing,
administration and research costs ($22 million) and the shift in CDC income,
partially offset by unfavorable margins ($36 million, due primarily to higher
meat and cheese commodity costs).

2000 compared with 1999

KFNA's reported volume for 2000 increased 2.8% over 1999. On an underlying
basis, volume increased 3.8%, including the benefit related to the 53rd week of
shipments, partially offset by a decrease related to trade inventory reductions
in 2000.

Reported operating revenues increased $564 million (3.2%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($465 million), the impact of acquisitions ($148
million) and higher pricing ($79 million), partially offset by the shift in CDC
revenues ($142 million).

Reported operating companies income increased $357 million (11.2%) over 1999,
due primarily to higher margins ($318 million, driven by higher pricing and
lower commodity-related costs), the 1999 pre-tax charge for separation programs
($157 million) and higher volume/mix ($240 million), partially offset by higher
marketing, administration and research costs ($310 million, the majority of
which related to higher marketing expenses) and the shift in CDC income ($54
million). On an underlying basis, operating companies income increased 7.8%.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFNA's reportable
segments.

Cheese, Meals and Enhancers: Reported volume in 2000 decreased 1.1% from 1999,
due primarily to a decrease in the United States food service business, which
more than offset an increase in retail businesses. The decrease in food service
volume was due to the expiration of an exclusive distribution agreement, the
loss of a contract to supply cold cuts and the pruning of low margin products.
Cheese volume increased over 1999 with gains in process, natural and cream
cheese products. Meals volume was lower in 2000, reflecting lower shipments of
Mexican dinners and rice. Enhancers volume decreased slightly. Volume in Canada
grew due to new product introductions. On an underlying basis, volume decreased
0.3%.

Reported operating revenues increased $45 million (0.5%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($99 million, primarily favorable product mix
from the pruning of low margin products) and favorable currency movements ($30
million), partially offset by the shift in CDC revenues ($68 million) and the
impact of divestitures ($15 million).

<PAGE>
                                Kraft Foods Inc.

Reported operating companies income increased $187 million (11.3%) over 1999 due
to higher margins ($254 million, driven by lower commodity-related and
manufacturing costs), higher volume/mix ($67 million) and the 1999 separation
charge ($71 million), partially offset by higher marketing, administration and
research costs ($171 million, the majority of which related to higher marketing
expenses) and the shift in CDC income ($30 million). Marketing expense increased
as the Company increased price promotions on cheese products during 2000 in the
United States during a period of intense competition that resulted from low
cheese commodity costs. On an underlying basis, operating companies income
increased 8.8%.

Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery: Reported volume in 2000 increased 14.9% over
1999, reflecting the continued success of two-compartment snacks and the
introduction of new intense mint and chocolate products.

Reported operating revenues increased $64 million (24.2%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix. Reported operating companies income increased
$27 million (37.0%) over 1999, due primarily to higher volume/mix ($45 million)
and the 1999 separation charge, partially offset by higher marketing,
administration and research costs ($24 million). On an underlying basis,
operating companies income increased 36.5%.

Beverages, Desserts and Cereals: Reported volume in 2000 increased 8.1% from
1999. Beverages volume grew on the strength of ready-to-drink beverages,
reflecting new product introductions, and higher coffee shipments due to growth
in Starbucks grocery coffee. Volume also grew in frozen whipped toppings, due in
part to the introduction of new products. These increases were partially offset
by lower volume in ready-to-eat cereals, due to aggressive competitive activity,
and lower volume in dry packaged desserts, reflecting lower promotions. On an
underlying basis, volume increased 9.5%, of which 0.6 percentage points related
to the acquisition of Balance Bar Co.

Reported operating revenues increased $192 million (3.8%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($126 million) and the acquisition of Balance Bar
Co. ($113 million), partially offset by the shift in CDC revenues ($44 million).

Reported operating companies income increased $81 million (8.0%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($50 million), the 1999 separation charges ($46
million), higher margins ($20 million, due primarily to lower commodity costs)
and the acquisition of Balance Bar Co., partially offset by higher marketing,
administration and research costs ($29 million, the majority of which related to
higher marketing expenses), and the shift in CDC income ($14 million). On an
underlying basis, operating companies income increased 4.7%.

Oscar Mayer and Pizza: Reported volume in 2000 increased 5.2% from 1999. Volume
grew in pizza, reflecting the continued success of rising crust pizza and new
product introductions. Volume growth also reflected the introduction of new
lunch combination varieties, the acquisition of Boca Burger, Inc. and gains in
hot dogs and cold cuts. On an underlying basis, volume increased 5.9%, of which
approximately 0.8 percentage points related to the acquisition of Boca Burger,
Inc.

Reported operating revenues increased $263 million (8.2%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($168 million), higher pricing ($82 million) and
the acquisition of Boca Burger, Inc. ($35 million), partially offset by the
shift in CDC revenues ($24 million).

Reported operating companies income increased $62 million (13.8%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($78 million), higher margins ($43 million) and
the 1999 separation charge ($38 million), partially offset by higher marketing,
administration and research costs ($86 million, the majority of which related to
higher marketing expenses) and the shift in CDC income ($8 million). On an
underlying basis, operating companies income increased 6.6%.

2001 compared with 2000

KFI's reported volume for 2001 increased 34.4% over 2000, due primarily to the
acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma basis, volume for 2001 increased 3.5%
over 2000. Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000, volume increased 4.7%,
benefiting from gains across most consumer sectors and driven by continued
growth in the developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America
and Asia Pacific.

During 2001, reported operating revenues increased $698 million (8.6%) over
2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($1.2 billion) and the shift
in CDC revenues ($26 million), partially offset by unfavorable currency
movements ($460 million) and the revenues of divested businesses ($148 million).
On a pro forma basis, operating revenues decreased 4.0%, primarily reflecting
unfavorable currency movements.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 increased $31 million (2.6%) over
2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($128 million), lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($119 million) and the shift in CDC
income ($13 million), partially offset by the gain on the French Confectionery
Sale in 2000 ($139 million), unfavorable currency movements ($51 million) and
income of divested businesses ($34 million). On a pro forma basis, which does
not include the French Confectionery Sale in 2000, operating companies income
increased 8.5%.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFI's reportable
segments.

Europe, Middle East and Africa: Reported and pro forma volume for 2001 decreased
slightly from 2000, due primarily to the 53rd week of shipments in 2000.
Excluding the 53rd week of shipments in 2000, volume increased 1.3%, due
primarily to volume gains in the developing markets of Central and Eastern
Europe and growth in many Western European markets, partially offset by lower
volume in Germany, reflecting increased price competition and trade inventory
reductions, and lower canned meats volume in Italy. In beverages, volume
increased in both coffee and refreshment beverages. Coffee volume grew in many
markets, driven by new product introductions and recent acquisitions in Romania,
Morocco and Bulgaria. In Germany, coffee volume increased despite trade
inventory reductions. Refreshment beverages volume increased, driven by higher
sales to the Middle East. Snacks volume increased, driven by confectionery and
salty snacks, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. Snacks volume in
Germany was lower due to increased price competition and trade inventory
reductions. Cheese volume increased due primarily to Philadelphia cream cheese
growth across the region, partially offset by lower volume in Germany. In
convenient meals and grocery, volume declined as lower canned meats volume in
Italy and a decline in grocery volume in Germany were partially offset by higher
shipments of lunch combinations and pourable dressings in the United Kingdom.

Reported operating revenues for 2001 decreased $485 million (7.1%) from 2000,
due primarily to unfavorable currency movements ($251 million), revenues from
divested businesses ($131 million), lower pricing ($123 million, primarily
commodity-driven coffee price decreases) and lower volume/mix ($69 million),
partially offset by the acquisition of Nabisco ($46 million), the 2001
acquisitions of coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria ($29 million)
and the shift in CDC revenues ($14 million). On a pro forma basis, operating
revenues decreased 6.1%, reflecting unfavorable currency movements and
commodity-related coffee price decreases.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 decreased $158 million (15.5%) from
2000, due primarily to the gain on the French Confectionery Sale in 2000 ($139
million), unfavorable currency movements ($19 million), income from divested
businesses ($32 million), lower volume/mix ($12 million) and unfavorable margins
($16 million), partially offset by lower marketing, administration and research
costs ($50 million) and the shift in CDC income. On a pro forma basis, operating
companies income increased 0.5%.

Latin America and Asia Pacific: Reported volume for 2001 increased more than
100% from 2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco. On a pro forma
basis, volume for 2001 increased 9.6% over 2000. Excluding the 53rd week of
shipments in 2000, volume increased 9.9%, due to gains across most consumer
sectors. Beverages volume increased, due primarily to growth in refreshment
beverages in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and coffee in Asia Pacific. Cheese
volume increased due primarily to cream cheese and process cheese. Grocery
volume was higher, due primarily to new product introductions. Snacks volume
increased, driven primarily by new biscuit product introductions

and geographic expansion, partially offset by lower volume in Argentina, due to
economic weakness. Continued erosion of the economic climate in Argentina may
negatively affect volume and income growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific
segment during 2002.

During 2001, reported operating revenues increased $1,183 million (94.9%) over
2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco, partially offset by
unfavorable currency movements. On a pro forma basis, operating revenues
increased 2.0%.

Reported operating companies income for 2001 increased $189 million (100.0%)
over 2000, due primarily to the acquisition of Nabisco ($128 million), lower
marketing, administration and research costs ($69 million), higher margins ($14
million) and the shift in CDC income, partially offset by unfavorable currency
movements ($32 million). On a pro forma basis, operating companies income
increased 32.7%, due primarily to productivity savings and Nabisco synergies.

2000 compared with 1999

KFI's reported volume for 2000 increased 1.5% over 1999, due primarily to volume
increases in both the Europe, Middle East & Africa and Latin America & Asia
Pacific segments. On an underlying basis, volume increased 4.9%, including the
impact of the 53rd week of shipments in 2000.

Reported operating revenues for 2000 decreased $829 million (9.3%) from 1999,
due primarily to unfavorable currency movements ($887 million), the shift in CDC
revenues ($52 million), lower pricing ($30 million, due primarily to
commodity-driven coffee price decreases) and the impact of divestitures ($196
million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($291 million). On an underlying
basis, operating revenues decreased 6.8%.

Reported operating companies income for 2000 increased by $145 million (13.6%)
to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher volume/mix ($147 million), the gain on
the French Confectionery Sale ($139 million) and higher margins ($84 million,
primarily relating to lower commodity costs), partially offset by unfavorable
currency movements ($96 million), higher marketing, administration and research
costs ($78 million), the shift in CDC income ($26 million) and the impact of
divested businesses. On an underlying basis, operating companies income
increased 5.3%.

The following discusses operating results within each of KFI's reportable
segments.

Europe, Middle East and Africa: Reported volume for 2000 increased 0.5% over
1999, while underlying volume increased 2.9% over 1999, with growth in all
product categories. In beverages, coffee volume benefited from growth in the
developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe and in the established markets
of Sweden, Austria, Italy and the United Kingdom. Volume in refreshment
beverages grew in Central and Eastern Europe, driven by the expansion of
powdered soft drinks. Volume growth in snacks reflected double-digit gains in
salty snacks on expansion into Central and Eastern Europe, as well as new
confectionery product launches and line extensions. Cheese volume grew on the
strength of Philadelphia cream cheese, reflecting successful marketing programs
across Europe and a re-launch in the Middle East. Volume also grew for process
cheese in Italy and Spain. In convenient meals, volume grew on the successful
launch of new lunch combination varieties in the United Kingdom and line
extensions of packaged dinners in Germany and Belgium. Volume grew in grocery,
reflecting gains in spoonable dressings, benefiting from effective marketing
programs in Italy and new product launches in Spain.

Reported operating revenues decreased $852 million (11.1%) from 1999, due
primarily to unfavorable currency movements ($830 million), lower pricing ($60
million, due primarily to commodity-driven coffee price decreases), the shift
in CDC revenues ($28 million) and the impact of divestitures ($163 million),
partially offset by higher volume/mix ($186 million). On an underlying basis,
operating revenues decreased 9.0%.

Reported operating companies income increased $124 million (13.9%) over 1999,
due primarily to the gain on the French Confectionery Sale ($139 million),
higher volume/mix ($104 million) and higher margins ($70 million, due primarily
to lower coffee commodity costs), partially offset by unfavorable currency
movements ($97 million), higher marketing, administration and research costs
($58 million), the shift in CDC income ($16 million) and the impact of
divestitures ($20 million). On an underlying basis, operating companies income
increased 2.5%.

Latin America and Asia Pacific: Reported volume for 2000 increased 5.1% over
1999. On an underlying basis, volume in 2000 increased 12.5% over 1999, led by
strong growth in Brazil, Australia, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and
Korea and higher exports to the Caribbean. Beverages volume grew due to
increased coffee volume in the Caribbean and China. Refreshment beverages volume
increased, benefiting from new flavors in Brazil, marketing programs in China
and the Philippines, and expansion into Thailand. Snacks volume gains were
driven by confectionery volume growth in Asia Pacific, reflecting new product
launches in Indonesia, China and the Philippines. In Latin America, volume
benefited from the launch of new chocolate products in Brazil. Cheese volume
grew, driven by marketing and promotion of Philadelphia cream cheese in
Australia and Japan, as well as gains in process cheese in the Philippines and
Indonesia. Convenient meals volume grew, led by exports of macaroni & cheese
dinners to Asian markets. Grocery volume grew on higher shipments of yeast
spread in Australia and increased shipments of gelatins and cereals to Asia.

Reported operating revenues increased $23 million (1.9%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($105 million) and higher pricing ($30 million),
partially offset by unfavorable currency movements ($57 million), the shift in
CDC revenues ($24 million) and the impact of divestitures ($33 million). On an
underlying basis, operating revenues increased 6.9%.

Reported operating companies income increased $21 million (12.5%) over 1999, due
primarily to higher volume/mix ($43 million) and higher pricing ($14 million),
partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs ($20
million) and the shift in CDC income ($10 million). On an underlying basis,
operating companies income increased 20.1%.

Financial Review

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion in 2001 and 2000,
while $2.7 billion was provided by operating activities in 1999. The increase in
2000 operating cash flows over 1999 primarily reflected increased net earnings
of $248 million and reduced levels of receivables and inventories of $318
million, which included the shift in working capital attributable to the CDC.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

During 2001, 2000 and 1999, net cash used in investing activities was $1.2
billion, $16.1 billion and $669 million, respectively. The increase in 2000
primarily reflects the cash used for the acquisition of Nabisco.

Capital expenditures, which were funded by operating activities, were $1.1
billion, $906 million and $860 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
capital expenditures were primarily to modernize the manufacturing facilities,
lower cost of production and expand production capacity for growing product
lines. The additional expenditures in 2001 were due primarily to the acquisition
of Nabisco. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion
in 2002 and are expected to be funded from operations.

During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and
Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland. The
total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $194 million.

During 2000, the Company purchased Boca Burger, Inc. and Balance Bar Co. The
total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $365 million.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

During 2001, net cash of $2.1 billion was used in financing activities, compared
with $13.0 billion provided by financing activities during 2000. During 2001,
financing activities included net debt repayments of $2.0 billion, excluding
debt repayments made with IPO proceeds. The net proceeds from the IPO were used
to repay debt to Philip Morris and, as a result, had no impact on financing cash
flows. In 2000, the Company's financing activities provided cash, as additional
borrowings to finance the acquisition of Nabisco exceeded the cash used to pay
dividends. During 1999, net cash of $2.0 billion was used in financing
activities.

Debt and Liquidity

The SEC recently issued Financial Reporting Release No. 61, which sets forth the
views of the SEC regarding enhanced disclosures relating to liquidity and
capital resources. The information provided below about the Company's debt,
credit facilities, guarantees and future commitments is included here to
facilitate a review of the Company's liquidity.

Debt: The Company's total debt, including intercompany accounts payable to
Philip Morris, was $16.0 billion at December 31, 2001, and $25.8 billion at
December 31, 2000. The decrease was due primarily to the repayment of $8.4
billion of long-term notes payable to Philip Morris with the net proceeds from
the IPO.

During 2001, the Company refinanced $2.6 billion, representing the remaining
portion of an $11.0 billion long-term note payable to Philip Morris, with the
proceeds from short-term borrowings. In addition, the Company refinanced
long-term, fixed-rate Swiss franc notes payable to Philip Morris with short-term
Swiss franc borrowings from Philip Morris at variable interest rates.

During 2001, in anticipation of a public bond offering, the Company converted
its $4.0 billion, 7.40% note payable to Philip Morris, originally maturing in
December 2002, into a 3.56125% note payable to Philip Morris maturing in
November 2001. On November 2, 2001, the Company completed a $4.0 billion public
global bond offering at a weighted average interest rate of 5.48%, the net
proceeds of which were used to repay the 3.56125% short-term note payable to
Philip Morris.

As discussed in Notes 3, 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company's total debt of $16.0 billion at December 31, 2001 is due to be repaid
as follows: in 2002, $4.9 billion; in 2003-2004, $0.5 billion; in 2005-2006,
$2.0 billion; and thereafter, $8.6 billion. Debt obligations due to be repaid in
2002 will be satisfied with a combination of short-term borrowings, refinancing
transactions in the debt markets and operating cash flows. The Company's
debt-to-equity ratio was 0.68 at December 31, 2001 and 1.84 at December 31,
2000.

Credit Ratings: The Company's credit ratings by Moody's at December 31, 2001
were "P-1" in the commercial paper market and "A2" for long-term debt
obligations. The Company's credit ratings by Standard & Poor's at December 31,
2001 were "A-1" in the commercial paper market, and "A-" for long-term debt
obligations. The Company's credit ratings by Fitch Rating Services at December
31, 2001 were "F-1" in the commercial paper market and "A" for long-term debt
obligations. Changes in the Company's credit ratings, although none are
currently anticipated, could result in corresponding changes in the Company's
borrowing costs. However, none of the Company's debt agreements require
accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings.

Credit Facilities: In July 2001, reflecting the Company's reduced requirements
for credit facilities following the IPO, Philip Morris terminated an existing
$9.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement that could have been transferred
to the Company. Upon

                                       33

                                Kraft Foods Inc.

termination of this facility, the Company entered into agreements for a $2.0
billion 5-year revolving credit facility expiring in July 2006 and a $4.0
billion 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in July 2002. Including these
revolving credit facilities, the Company's total credit facilities were $6.8
billion at December 31, 2001, of which approximately $6.5 billion were undrawn
at December 31, 2001. Certain of these credit facilities are used to support
commercial paper borrowings, the proceeds of which will be used for general
corporate purposes. A portion of the facilities is used to meet the short-term
working capital needs of the Company's international businesses. Certain of the
credit facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth, as defined, of
$18.2 billion, which the Company exceeded at December 31, 2001. The Company does
not currently anticipate any difficulty in continuing to exceed this covenant
requirement. The foregoing revolving credit facilities do not include any other
covenants that could require an acceleration of maturity or the posting of
collateral. The five-year revolving credit facility enables the Company to
reclassify short-term debt on a long-term basis. At December 31, 2001, $2.0
billion of commercial paper borrowings that the Company intends to refinance
were reclassified as long-term debt. The Company expects to continue to
refinance long-term and short-term debt from time to time. The nature and amount
of the Company's long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of
each can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market
conditions and other factors.

Guarantees and Commitments: At December 31, 2001, the Company was contingently
liable for guarantees and commitments of $41 million. These include surety bonds
related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to letters of
credit. Guarantees do not have, and are not expected to have, a significant
impact on the Company's liquidity. The Company's consolidated rent expense for
2001 was $372 million. Accordingly, the Company does not consider its lease
commitments to be a significant determinant of the Company's liquidity.

                    ---------------------------------------

The Company believes that its cash from operations, existing credit facilities
and access to global capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet
its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and payment of its
anticipated quarterly dividends.

Dividends

Dividends paid in 2001 and 2000 were $225 million and $1.0 billion,
respectively. The dividends paid in 2000 reflect dividends to Philip Morris.
During 2001, the Company declared two regular quarterly dividends of $0.13 per
share on its Class A and Class B common stock. The present annualized dividend
rate is $0.52 per common share. The declaration of dividends is subject to the
discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend on various
factors, including the Company's net earnings, financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the
Company's board of directors.

Market Risk

The Company operates internationally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in
various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial instruments
to manage its foreign currency and commodity exposures, which primarily relate
to forecasted transactions and interest rate exposures. Derivative financial
instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposures to market
risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices
and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party
to leveraged derivatives. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception
and throughout the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature and
relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge
transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for
hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected
terms of a forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must
be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. Financial instruments
qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness
between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and
throughout the hedged period. The Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.

Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are
effective as hedges under the new accounting standard. Accordingly, the Company
recorded deferred losses of $18 million in accumulated other comprehensive
losses. This reflects the initial adoption of the accounting pronouncement and a
decrease in the fair value of derivatives during the year of $33 million,
partially offset by deferred losses transferred to earnings of $15 million. The
fair value of all derivative financial instruments has been calculated based on
active market quotes.

Foreign Exchange Rates: The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and
foreign currency options to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates from third-party and intercompany forecasted transactions. The
primary currencies to which the Company is exposed include the euro and Canadian
dollar. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had option and forward
foreign exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $431 million and
$237 million, respectively, for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies.

                                       34
<PAGE>
                                Kraft Foods Inc.

Commodities: The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted
purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Company's
businesses. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward contracts, as cash
flow hedges, primarily for coffee, cocoa, milk, cheese and wheat. Commodity
futures and options are also used to hedge the price of certain commodities,
including milk, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn, sugar and soybean. At December 31,
2001 and 2000, the Company had net long commodity positions of $589 million and
$617 million, respectively.

Interest Rates: The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of
an insignificant portion of its long-term debt. The differential to be paid or
received is accrued and recognized as interest expense. If an interest rate swap
agreement is terminated prior to maturity, the realized gain or loss is
recognized over the remaining life of the agreement if the hedged amount remains
outstanding, or immediately if the underlying hedged exposure does not remain
outstanding. If the underlying exposure is terminated prior to the maturity of
the interest rate swap, the unrealized gain or loss on the related interest rate
swap is recognized in earnings currently. At December 31, 2001, the aggregate
notional principal amount of those agreements, which converted fixed-rate debt
to variable-rate debt, was $102 million. Aggregate maturities at December 31,
2001 were $29 million in 2003 and $73 million in 2004. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, there was no ineffectiveness relating to these fair value
hedges.

Value at Risk: The Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") computation to estimate
the potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate-sensitive
financial instruments and to estimate the potential one-day loss in pre-tax
earnings of its foreign currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative
financial instruments. The VAR computation includes the Company's debt;
short-term investments; foreign currency forwards, swaps and options; and
commodity futures, forwards and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign
currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign
subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were
excluded from the computation.

The VAR estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95%
confidence interval. The Company used a "variance/co-variance" model to
determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates
and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing
interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for
the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and over each of
the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during
each year. The values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on
a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity, and were valued
accordingly in the VAR computation.

The estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of the Company's interest
rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and
the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from foreign currency
and commodity instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the
VAR model, were as follows:

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate
the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates,
foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions. The
computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or
earnings to be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the effect of
favorable changes in market rates. The Company cannot predict actual future
movements in such market rates and does not present these VAR results to be
indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of
any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on its future
results of operations or financial position.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," and its related amendment, SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" (collectively referred to
as "SFAS No. 133"). These standards require that all derivative financial
instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value
as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are
recorded each period in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive losses,
depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge
transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on
derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are
included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged
item. As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of these new standards did not have a
material effect on net earnings (less than $1 million) or accumulated other
comprehensive losses (less than $1 million).

The Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued EITF Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting
for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products."
As a result, certain items previously included in marketing, administration and
research costs on the consolidated statement of earnings will either be recorded
as a reduction of operating revenues or as an increase in cost of sales. These
EITF Issues will be effective in the first quarter of 2002. The Company
estimates that adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and No. 00-25 will result in a
reduction of operating revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999 of approximately $4.6
billion, $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Marketing, administration
and research costs will decline in 2001, 2000 and 1999 by approximately $4.7
billion, $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, while cost of sales will
increase by an insignificant amount. The adoption of these EITF Issues will have
no impact on net earnings or basic and diluted EPS.

During 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.
141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." Effective January 1, 2002, the Company will no longer be required to
amortize indefinite life goodwill and intangible assets as a charge to earnings.
In addition, the Company will be required to conduct an annual review of
goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment. The Company
estimates that net earnings and diluted earnings per share would have been
approximately $2,839 million and $1.76, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2001; $2,531 million and $1.74, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2000; and $2,287 million and $1.57, respectively, for the year
ended December 31, 1999, had the provisions of the new standards been applied in
those years. The Company does not currently anticipate having to record a charge
to earnings for the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets
as a result of adoption of these new standards.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which replaces SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." SFAS
No. 144 provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of
an impairment loss for certain types of long-lived assets, expands the scope of
a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity and eliminates the
current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to
be temporary. SFAS No. 144 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2002. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact
on the Company's 2002 financial statements.

Contingencies

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral
forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in its reports to
shareholders. One can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words
such as "strategy," "expects," "plans," "believes," "will," "estimates,"
"intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning.
One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is hereby
identifying important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by
or on behalf of the Company; any such statement is qualified by reference to the
following cautionary statements.

Each of the Company's segments is subject to intense competition, changes in
consumer preferences, the effects of changing prices for its raw materials and
local economic conditions. Their results are dependent upon their continued
ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new
consumer trends, to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand
portfolios, in order to compete effectively with lower priced products in a
consolidating environment at the retail and manufacturing levels, and to improve
productivity. The Company's results are also dependent on its ability to
successfully integrate and derive cost savings from the integration of Nabisco's
operations with the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to the effects
of foreign economies, currency movements and fluctuations in levels of customer
inventories. The food industry continues to be subject to the possibility that
consumers could lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food
products. Developments in any of these areas, which are more fully described
above and which descriptions are incorporated into this section by reference,
could cause the Company's results to differ materially from results that have
been or may be projected by or on behalf of the Company. The Company cautions
that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. The Company does
not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time
to time by or on behalf of the Company.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



Note 1. Background and Basis of Presentation:

Background: Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the
Commonwealth of Virginia. Following Kraft's formation, Philip Morris Companies
Inc. ("Philip Morris") transferred to Kraft its ownership interest in Kraft
Foods North America, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through a capital
contribution. In addition, during 2000, Philip Morris transferred management
responsibility for its food businesses in Latin America to Kraft Foods North
America, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kraft Foods International, Inc.
Kraft, together with its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the
"Company"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of retail packaged foods in
the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific.

On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Nabisco Holdings Corp. ("Nabisco") for $55 per share in cash. See Note 5,
Acquisitions, for a complete discussion of this transaction.

Prior to June 13, 2001, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip
Morris. On June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering
("IPO") of 280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00
per share. The IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and expenses, of
$8.4 billion were used to retire a portion of an $11.0 billion long-term note
payable to Philip Morris incurred in connection with the acquisition of Nabisco.
After the IPO, Philip Morris owns approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares
of the Company's capital stock through its ownership of 49.5% of the Company's
Class A common stock and 100% of the Company's Class B common stock. The
Company's Class A common stock has one vote per share while the Company's Class
B common stock has ten votes per share. Therefore, Philip Morris holds 97.7% of
the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.

Basis of presentation: The consolidated financial statements include the Company
and its subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
operating revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. The Company's operating subsidiaries report
year-end results as of the Saturday closest to December 31 each year. This
resulted in fifty-three weeks of operating results in the Company's consolidated
statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
year's presentation.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Cash and cash equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks
and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The last-in,
first-out ("LIFO") method is used to cost substantially all domestic
inventories. The cost of other inventories is principally determined by the
average cost method.

Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets,
including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in
business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be fully recoverable. The Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow
analyses to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to
exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment
losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds
to be received, less costs of disposal.

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which replaces SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of." SFAS No. 144 provides updated guidance concerning the recognition
and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long-lived assets,
expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an
entity and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a
subsidiary is likely to be temporary. SFAS No. 144 is effective for the Company
on January 1, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to
have a material impact on the Company's 2002 financial statements.

Depreciation, amortization and goodwill valuation: Property, plant and equipment
are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over
the lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods
ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods
up to 40 years. Goodwill and other intangible assets substantially comprise
brand names purchased through acquisitions. In consideration of the long
histories of these brands, goodwill and other intangible assets associated with
them are amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years.

                                       43
<PAGE>
                                Kraft Foods Inc.

During 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No.
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Effective January 1, 2002, the
Company will no longer be required to amortize indefinite life goodwill and
intangible assets as a charge to earnings. In addition, the Company will be
required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets for
potential impairment. The Company estimates that net earnings and diluted
earnings per share ("EPS") would have been approximately $2,839 million and
$1.76, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001; $2,531 million and
$1.74, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000; and $2,287 million
and $1.57, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1999, had the
provisions of the new standards been applied in those years. The Company does
not currently anticipate having to record a charge to earnings for the potential
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of adoption of
these new standards.

Marketing costs: The Company promotes its products with significant marketing
activities, including advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade
promotion activities are recorded as expense based on amounts estimated as being
due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on the
Company's historical utilization and redemption rates.

Revenue recognition: The Company recognizes operating revenue upon shipment of
goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers. The Company classifies
shipping and handling costs as part of cost of sales.

The Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued EITF Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting
for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products."
As a result, certain items previously included in marketing, administration and
research costs on the consolidated statement of earnings will either be recorded
as a reduction of operating revenues or as an increase in cost of sales. These
EITF Issues will be effective in the first quarter of 2002. The Company
estimates that adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and No. 00-25 will result in a
reduction of operating revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999 of approximately $4.6
billion, $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Marketing, administration
and research costs will decline in 2001, 2000 and 1999 by approximately $4.7
billion, $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, while cost of sales will
increase by an insignificant amount. The adoption of these EITF Issues will have
no impact on net earnings or basic and diluted EPS.

Hedging instruments: Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and its
related amendment, SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments
and Certain Hedging Activities" (collectively referred to as "SFAS No. 133").
These standards require that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on
the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value as either assets or
liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period
in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive losses, depending on whether a
derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and, if it
is, the type of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments
reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are included in earnings in
the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item. As of January 1,
2001, the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on net
earnings (less than $1 million) or accumulated other comprehensive losses (less
than $1 million).

Stock-based compensation: The Company accounts for employee stock compensation
plans in accordance with the intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which does not result in
compensation cost.

Income taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The accounts of the Company are included in
the consolidated federal income tax return of Philip Morris. Income taxes are
generally computed on a separate company basis. To the extent that foreign tax
credits, capital losses and other credits generated by the Company, which cannot
be utilized on a separate company basis, are utilized in Philip Morris'
consolidated federal income tax return, the benefit is recognized in the
calculation of the Company's provision for income taxes. The Company's
provisions for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of earnings
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were lower than provisions
calculated on a separate return basis by $185 million, $139 million and $107
million, respectively. The Company makes payments to, or is reimbursed by,
Philip Morris for the tax effects resulting from its inclusion in Philip Morris'
consolidated federal income tax return.

Software costs: The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software
development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer
software for internal use. Capitalized software costs, which are not
significant, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the software, which do not exceed five years.

Foreign currency translation: The Company translates the results of operations
of its foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period,
whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of
each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
shareholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses for all periods presented
were not significant.

Environmental costs: The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to
the protection of the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated
with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and
can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information
develops or circumstances change.

                                       44
<PAGE>
                                Kraft Foods Inc.

While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of
actions regarding environmental remediation and compliance efforts that the
Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management, environmental
remediation and compliance costs, before taking into account any recoveries from
third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 3. Related Party Transactions:

Philip Morris and certain of its affiliates provide the Company with various
services, including planning, legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, insurance,
human resources, office of the secretary, corporate affairs, information
technology and tax services. In 2001, the Company entered into a formal
agreement with Philip Morris providing for a continuation of these services, the
cost of which increased $91 million as Philip Morris provided information
technology and financial services, all of which were previously performed by the
Company at approximately the same cost. Billings for these services, which were
based on the cost to Philip Morris to provide such services, were $339 million,
$248 million and $165 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. These costs were paid to Philip Morris monthly. Although the
cost of these services cannot be quantified on a stand-alone basis, management
believes that the billings are reasonable based on the level of support provided
by Philip Morris and its affiliates, and that they reflect all services
provided. The effects of these transactions are included in operating cash flows
in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.

In addition, the Company's daily net cash or overdraft position is transferred
to Philip Morris or a European subsidiary of Philip Morris. The Company pays or
receives interest based upon the applicable commercial paper rate, or the London
Interbank Offered Rate, on the net amount payable to, or receivable from, Philip
Morris or its European subsidiary.

The Company also has long-term notes payable to its parent, Philip Morris, and
its affiliates as follows:

================================================================================
</TABLE>

The two notes maturing in 2002 were related to the financing for the acquisition
of Nabisco and were at market interest rates available to Philip Morris for debt
with matching maturities.

During 2001, the Company used the IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting discount
and expenses, of $8.4 billion to retire a portion of the $11.0 billion long-term
note payable to Philip Morris. The remainder of this note was repaid with the
proceeds from commercial paper borrowings. The Company repaid the $4.0 billion
note primarily with the net proceeds from a $4.0 billion public global bond
offering. The Company also refinanced the two long-term Swiss franc notes
payable to Philip Morris with short-term Swiss franc borrowings from Philip
Morris at variable interest rates. The short-term Swiss franc borrowings are
included in due to parent and affiliates on the Company's consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2001.

Based on interest rates available to the Company for issuances of debt with
similar terms and remaining maturities, the aggregate fair values of the
Company's long-term notes payable to Philip Morris and its affiliates at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $5,325 million and $21,357 million,
respectively. The fair values of the Company's current amounts due to parent and
affiliates approximate carrying amounts.

Note 4. Divestitures:

During 2001, the Company sold several small food businesses. The aggregate
proceeds received in these transactions were $21 million, on which the Company
recorded a pre-tax gain of $8 million.

During 2000, the Company sold a French confectionery business for proceeds of
$251 million, on which a pre-tax gain of $139 million was recorded. Several
small international and domestic food businesses were also sold in 2000. The
aggregate proceeds received in these transactions were $300 million, on which
the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $172 million.

During 1999, the Company sold several small international and domestic food
businesses. The aggregate proceeds received in these transactions were $175
million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $62 million.

The operating results of the businesses sold were not material to the Company's
consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented. Pre-tax gains on
these divestitures were included in marketing, administration and research costs
on the Company's consolidated statements of earnings.

Note 5. Acquisitions:

Nabisco: On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of Nabisco for $55 per share in cash. The purchase of the outstanding
shares, retirement of employee stock options and other payments totaled
approximately $15.2 billion. In addition, the acquisition included the
assumption of approximately $4.0 billion of existing Nabisco debt. The Company
financed the acquisition through the issuance of two long-term notes payable to
Philip Morris totaling $15.0 billion and short-term intercompany borrowings of
$255 million. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. Nabisco's
balance sheet was consolidated with the Company as of December 31, 2000, and
beginning January 1, 2001, Nabisco's earnings have been included in the
consolidated operating results of the Company; however, Nabisco's earnings from
December 11, 2000 to December 31, 2000 were not included in the consolidated
operating results of the Company since such amounts were insignificant. The
Company's interest cost associated with acquiring Nabisco has been included in
interest and other debt expense, net, on the Company's consolidated statements
of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

During 2001, the Company completed the allocation of excess purchase price
relating to Nabisco. As a result, the Company recorded, among other things, the
final valuations of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets,
primarily trade names, amounts relating to the closure of Nabisco facilities and
related deferred income taxes. The final allocation of excess purchase price at
December 31, 2001 was as follows:

Goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2001               $22,023
================================================================================
</TABLE>

Goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2001 include approximately
$11.7 billion related to trade names. The Company also recorded deferred federal
income taxes of $3.9 billion related to trade names.

The closure of a number of Nabisco domestic and international facilities
resulted in severance and other exit costs of $379 million, which are included
in the above adjustments for the allocation of purchase price. The closures will
result in the elimination of approximately 7,500 employees and will require
total cash payments of $373 million, of which approximately $74 million has been
spent through December 31, 2001.

The integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company will also result
in the closure of several of the Company's existing facilities. The aggregate
charges to the Company's consolidated statement of earnings to close or
reconfigure its facilities and integrate Nabisco are estimated to be in the
range of $200 million to $300 million. During 2001, the Company incurred pre-tax
integration costs of $53 million for site reconfigurations and other
consolidation programs in the United States. In October 2001, the Company
announced that it was offering a voluntary retirement program to certain
salaried employees in the United States. The program is expected to eliminate
approximately 750 employees and will result in an estimated pre-tax charge of
approximately $140 million upon final employee acceptance in the first quarter
of 2002.

Assuming the acquisition of Nabisco occurred at the beginning of 2000 and 1999,
pro forma operating revenues would have been approximately $34 billion in each
year; pro forma net earnings would have been $1.4 billion in 2000 and $1.1
billion in 1999; while basic and diluted EPS would have been $0.96 in 2000 and
$0.77 in 1999. These pro forma results, which are unaudited, do not give effect
to any synergies expected to result from the merger of Nabisco's operations with
those of the Company, nor do they give effect to the reduction of interest
expense from the repayment of borrowings with the proceeds from the IPO. The pro
forma results also do not reflect the effects of SFAS No. 141 and 142 on the
amortization of goodwill or other intangible assets, or the EITF Issues
concerning the classification of certain expenses on the consolidated statements
of earnings. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what
actually would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated and the IPO
completed, at the beginning of each year, nor are they necessarily indicative of
future consolidated operating results.

Other acquisitions: During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in
Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in
Russia and Poland. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was
$194 million.

During 2000, the Company purchased the outstanding common stock of Balance Bar
Co., a maker of energy and nutrition snack products. In a separate transaction,
the Company also acquired Boca Burger, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of
soy-based meat alternatives. The total cost of these and other smaller
acquisitions was $365 million.

During 1999, the Company purchased several small North American and
international food businesses for $14 million.

The effects of these acquisitions were not material to the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations in any of the periods
presented.

Note 6. Inventories:

The cost of approximately 54% and 56% of inventories in 2001 and 2000,
respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The stated LIFO amounts of
inventories were approximately $150 million and $171 million higher than the
current cost of inventories at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Note 7. Short-Term Borrowings and Borrowing Arrangements:

At December 31, 2001, the Company had short-term borrowings of $2,681 million,
consisting principally of commercial paper borrowings with an average year-end
interest rate of 1.9%. Of this amount, the Company reclassified $2.0 billion of
the commercial paper borrowings to long-term debt based upon its intent and
ability to refinance these borrowings. At December 31, 2000, the Company had
short-term borrowings of $146 million with an average year-end interest rate of
9.2%.

The fair values of the Company's short-term borrowings at December 31, 2001 and
2000, based upon current market interest rates, approximate the amounts
disclosed above.

During 2001, the Company entered into agreements for a $2.0 billion 5-year
revolving credit facility maturing in July 2006 and a $4.0 billion 364-day
revolving credit facility maturing in July 2002. The Company intends to use
these credit facilities to support commercial paper borrowings, the proceeds of
which will be used for general corporate purposes. These facilities require the
maintenance of a minimum net worth. None of these facilities were drawn at
December 31, 2001. In addition, the Company maintains credit lines with a number
of lending institutions amounting to approximately $768 million. The Company
maintains these credit lines primarily to meet the short-term working capital
needs of its international businesses.

Note 8. Long-Term Debt:

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company's long-term debt consisted of the
following:

Based on market quotes, where available, or interest rates currently available
to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities,
the aggregate fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current
portion of long-term debt, at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $8,679 million and
$3,459 million, respectively.

Note 9. Capital Stock:

The Company's articles of incorporation authorize 3.0 billion shares of Class A
common stock, 2.0 billion shares of Class B common stock and 500 million shares
of preferred stock. At December 31, 2001, there were 555 million Class A common
shares and 1.18 billion Class B common shares issued and outstanding, of which
Philip Morris holds 275 million Class A common shares and all of the Class B
common shares. There are no preferred shares issued and outstanding. Class A
common shares are entitled to one vote each while Class B common shares are
entitled to ten votes each. Therefore, Philip Morris holds 97.7% of the combined
voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock. At December 31, 2001,
75,949,530 shares of common stock were reserved for stock options and other
stock awards.

Note 10. Stock Plans:

The Company's Board of Directors has adopted the 2001 Kraft Performance
Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which was established concurrently with the IPO.
Under the Plan, the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, reload options and other awards based on the Company's Class A
common stock, as well as performance-based annual and long-term incentive
awards. Up to 75 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock may be
issued under the Plan. The Company's Board of Directors granted options for
21,029,777 shares of Class A common stock concurrent with the closing date of
the IPO (June 13, 2001) at an exercise price equal to the IPO price of $31.00
per share. A portion of the shares granted (18,904,637) becomes exercisable on
January 31, 2003, and will expire ten years from the date of the grant. The
remainder of the shares granted (2,125,140) may become exercisable on a schedule
based on total shareholder return for the Company's Class A common stock during
the three years following the date of the grant, or will become exercisable five
years from the date of the grant. These options will also expire ten years from
the date

of the grant. Shares available to be granted under the Plan at December 31, 2001
were 54,688,173.

The Company's Board of Directors has also adopted the Kraft Director Plan. Under
the Kraft Director Plan, awards are granted only to members of the Board of
Directors who are not full-time employees of the Company or Philip Morris or
their subsidiaries. Up to 500,000 shares of Class A common stock may be awarded
under the Kraft Director Plan. During 2001, 8,945 stock options were granted
under the Kraft Director Plan. Shares available to be granted under the Kraft
Director Plan at December 31, 2001 were 491,055.

The Company accounts for the plans in accordance with the intrinsic value-based
method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
which does not result in compensation cost.

Option activity was as follows for the year ended December 31, 2001:

Prior to the IPO, certain employees of the Company participated in Philip
Morris' stock compensation plans. Philip Morris does not currently intend to
issue additional Philip Morris stock compensation to the Company's employees.
Philip Morris accounts for its plans in accordance with the intrinsic
value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," which does not result in compensation cost.

The Company's employees held options to purchase the following number of shares
of Philip Morris' stock: 57,349,595 shares at an average exercise price of
$34.66 per share at December 31, 2001; 56,977,329 shares at an average exercise
price of $30.46 per share at December 31, 2000; and 39,911,082 shares at an
average exercise price of $34.34 per share at December 31, 1999. Of these
amounts, the following were exercisable at each date: 44,930,609 at an average
exercise price of $31.95 per share at December 31, 2001; 38,444,963 at an
average exercise price of $34.82 per share at December 31, 2000; and 31,071,681
at an average exercise price of $32.75 per share at December 31, 1999.

Had compensation cost for stock option awards under the Kraft plans and Philip
Morris' plans been determined by using the fair value at the grant date, the
Company's net earnings and EPS (basic and diluted) would have been $1,785
million and $1.11 for the year ended December 31, 2001; $1,947 million and $1.34
for the year ended December 31, 2000; and $1,713 million and $1.18 for the year
ended December 31, 1999. The foregoing impact of compensation cost was
determined using a modified Black-Scholes methodology and the following
assumptions:

In addition, certain of the Company's employees held shares of Philip Morris
restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock, giving these employees
in most instances all of the rights of shareholders, except that they may not
sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such shares and rights. Such shares
are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. During
2001 and 2000, Philip Morris granted to certain of the Company's U.S. employees
restricted stock of 279,120 shares and 2,113,570 shares, respectively. Philip
Morris also issued to certain of the Company's non-U.S. employees rights to
receive 31,310 and 683,790 equivalent shares during 2001 and 2000, respectively.
During 1999, there were no restricted stock grants issued to the Company's
employees. At December 31, 2001, restrictions on the stock, net of forfeitures,
lapse as follows: 2002--2,638,410 shares; and 2003--92,000 shares. The fair
value of the restricted shares and rights at the date of grant is amortized to
expense ratably over the restriction period through a charge from Philip Morris.
In 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company recorded compensation expense related to
restricted stock awards of $39 million, $23 million and $3 million,
respectively.

Note 13. Segment Reporting:

The Company manufactures and markets packaged retail food products, consisting
principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals and various packaged
grocery products through its North American and international food businesses.
Reportable segments for the North American businesses are organized and managed
principally by product category. The North American food segments are Cheese,
Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages, Desserts and
Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Kraft Foods North America's food service
business within the United States and its businesses in Canada and Mexico are
managed through the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment. International
operations are organized and managed by geographic location. The international
food segments are Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin America and Asia
Pacific.

The Company's management reviews operating companies income to evaluate segment
performance and allocate resources. Operating companies income excludes general
corporate expenses and amortization of goodwill. Interest and other debt
expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and,
accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded
from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management. The Company's
assets, which are principally in the United States and Europe, are managed
geographically. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

During 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $53 million for site
reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the United States. In
addition, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million to close a North
American food factory. These pre-tax charges, which aggregate $82 million, were
included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated
statement of earnings for the following segments: Cheese, Meals and Enhancers,
$63 million; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery, $2 million; Beverages, Desserts
and Cereals, $12 million; and Oscar Mayer and Pizza, $5 million.

During 1999, the Company's North American food business announced that it was
offering voluntary retirement incentive or separation programs to certain
eligible hourly and salaried employees in the United States. Employees electing
to terminate employment under the terms of these programs were entitled to
enhanced retirement or severance benefits. Approximately 1,100 hourly and
salaried employees accepted the benefits offered by these programs and elected
to retire or terminate. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
$157 million during 1999. This charge was included in marketing, administration
and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings for the following
segments: Cheese, Meals and Enhancers, $71 million; Oscar Mayer and Pizza, $38
million; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery, $2 million; and Beverages, Desserts
and Cereals, $46 million. Payments of pension and postretirement benefits are
made in accordance with the terms of the applicable benefit plans. Severance
benefits, which were paid over a period of time, commenced upon dates of
termination which ranged from April 1999 to March 2000. The program and related
payments were completed during 2000. Salary and related benefit costs of
employees prior to their retirement or termination date were expensed as
incurred.

See Notes 4 and 5 regarding divestitures and acquisitions. The acquisition of
Nabisco primarily affected the reported results of the Biscuits, Snacks and
Confectionery and the Latin America and Asia Pacific segments.

In 2001 and 2000, retiring employees elected lump-sum payments, resulting in
settlement gains of $12 million and $34 million, respectively. During 2001, the
Company announced that it was offering a voluntary early retirement program to
certain eligible salaried employees in the United States. The program is
expected to eliminate approximately 750 employees and will result in a pre-tax
charge of approximately $140 million upon final employee acceptance in the first
quarter of 2002. During 1999, the Company instituted an early retirement and
workforce reduction program that resulted in settlement gains, net of additional
termination benefits of $41 million.

The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net prepaid asset of
$1,796 million and $1,741 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
These amounts were recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 as prepaid pension assets of $2,675 million and
$2,623 million, respectively, for those plans in which plan assets exceeded
their accumulated benefit obligations and as other liabilities of $879 million
and $882 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for plans in which
the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded their plan assets.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, certain of the Company's U.S. plans were
unfunded, with projected benefit and accumulated benefit obligations of $213
million and $164 million, respectively, in 2001 and $156 million and $97
million, respectively, in 2000. For certain non-U.S. plans, which have
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit
obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were
$1,165 million, $1,073 million and $416 million, respectively, as of December
31, 2001 and $639 million, $596 million and $49 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2000.

The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the Company's
obligations under the plans:

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor employee savings plans, to
which the Company contributes. These plans cover certain salaried, non-union and
union employees. The Company's contributions and costs are determined by the
matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to
expense for defined contribution plans totaled $63 million, $43 million and $41
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The current portion of the Company's accrued postretirement health care costs of
$172 million and $138 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, are
included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for U.S. plans was 7.5% in 2000, 6.8% in 2001
and 6.2% in 2002, gradually declining to 5.0% by the year 2005 and remaining at
that level thereafter. For Canadian plans, the assumed health care cost trend
rate was 8.0% in 2000, 9.0% in 2001 and 8.0% in 2002, gradually declining to
4.0% by the year 2006 and remaining at that level thereafter. A one-
percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates for each
year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 2001 and postretirement health care cost (service cost and interest
cost) for the year then ended by approximately 9.2% and 12.9%, respectively. A
one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates for
each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 2001 and postretirement health care cost (service cost and interest
cost) for the year then ended by approximately 7.6% and 10.4%, respectively.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligations for U.S. plans at December
31, 2001 and 2000 were determined using an assumed discount rate of 7.0% and
7.75%, respectively. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligations for
Canadian plans at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were determined using assumed
discount rates of 6.75% and 7.0%, respectively.

Postemployment Benefit Plans: The Company and certain of its affiliates sponsor
postemployment benefit plans covering substantially all salaried and certain
hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working
lives of the covered employees. Net postemployment costs consisted of the
following for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

The accumulated benefit obligation was determined using an assumed ultimate
annual turnover rate of 0.3% in 2001 and 2000, assumed compensation cost
increases of 4.5% in 2001 and 2000, and assumed benefits as defined in the
respective plans. Postemployment costs arising from actions that offer employees
benefits in excess of those specified in the respective plans are charged to
expense when incurred.

Note 16. Financial Instruments:

Derivative financial instruments: The Company operates internationally, with
manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world and
utilizes certain financial instruments to manage its foreign currency and
commodity exposures, primarily related to forecasted transactions and interest
rate exposures. Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company,
principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures. The
Company is not a party to leveraged derivatives. For a derivative to qualify as
a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, the Company formally
documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for
undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge
effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the
significant characteristics and expected terms of a forecasted transaction must
be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted
transaction will occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted
transaction will not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings
currently. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a
specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item
being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period.

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options
to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from
third-party and intercompany forecasted transactions. The primary currencies to
which the Company is exposed include the Euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had option and forward foreign
exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $431 million and $237
million, respectively, for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies. The
effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with forward
contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses
until the underlying hedged transactions are reported on the Company's
consolidated statement of earnings.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of an insignificant
portion of its long-term debt. The differential to be paid or received is
accrued and recognized as interest expense. If an interest rate swap agreement
is terminated prior to maturity, the realized gain or loss is recognized over
the remaining life of the agreement if the hedged amount remains outstanding, or
immediately if the underlying hedged exposure does not remain outstanding. If
the underlying exposure is terminated prior to the maturity of the interest rate
swap, the unrealized gain or loss on the related interest rate swap is
recognized in earnings currently. At December 31, 2001, the aggregate notional
principal amount of those agreements was $102 million. Aggregate maturities at
December 31, 2001 were $29 million in 2003 and $73 million in 2004. During the
year ended December 31, 2001, there was no ineffectiveness relating to these
fair value hedges.

During the year ended December 31, 2001, ineffectiveness related to cash flow
hedges was not material. The Company is hedging forecasted transactions for
periods not exceeding the next eighteen months and expects substantially all
amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses to be reclassified to
the consolidated statement of earnings within the next twelve months.

The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain
commodities used as raw materials by the Company's businesses. Accordingly, the
Company uses commodity forward contracts, as cash flow hedges, primarily for
coffee, cocoa, milk, cheese and wheat. Commodity futures and options are also
used to hedge the price of certain commodities, including milk, coffee, cocoa,
wheat, corn, sugar, soybean and energy. In general, commodity forward contracts
qualify for the normal purchase exception under SFAS No. 133 and are, therefore,
not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2001 and 2000,
the Company had net long commodity positions of $589 million and $617 million,
respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on net commodity positions were
immaterial at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The effective portion of unrealized
gains and losses on commodity futures and option contracts is deferred as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive losses and is recognized as a
component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statement of earnings
when the related inventory is sold.

Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income
taxes, during the year ended December 31, 2001, as follows:

The Company does not engage in trading or other speculative use of financial
instruments. Derivative losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive
losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of these losses
from accumulated other comprehensive losses to earnings are offset by gains on
the underlying hedged items.

                                Kraft Foods Inc.

Credit exposure and credit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by counterparties. However, the Company does not
anticipate nonperformance and such exposure was not material at December 31,
2001.

Fair value: The aggregate fair value, based on market quotes, of the Company's
third-party debt at December 31, 2001 was $9,360 million as compared with its
carrying value of $9,355 million. The aggregate fair value of the Company's
third-party debt at December 31, 2000 was $3,605 million as compared with its
carrying value of $3,554 million. Based on interest rates available to the
Company for issuances of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities, the
aggregate fair value and carrying value of the Company's long-term notes payable
to Philip Morris and its affiliates were $5,325 million and $5,000 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $21,357 million and $21,407 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2000.

See Notes 3, 7 and 8 for additional disclosures of fair value for short-term
borrowings and long-term debt.

Note 17. Contingencies:

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings
arising out of the normal course of business, including a few cases in which
substantial amounts of damages are sought. The Company believes that it has
valid defenses and is vigorously defending the litigation pending against it.
While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management
believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the shares of
the Company's Class A common stock being sold in the IPO, some of the
underwriters of the IPO provided written copies of a "pre-marketing feedback"
form to certain potential purchasers of the Company's Class A common stock. The
feedback form was for internal use only and was designed to elicit orally
certain information from designated accounts as part of designing strategy in
connection with the IPO. This form may have constituted a prospectus that did
not meet the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

If the distribution of this form by the underwriters did constitute a violation
of the Securities Act of 1933, persons who received this form, directly or
indirectly, and who purchased the Company's Class A common stock in the IPO may
have the right, for a period of one year from the date of the violation, to
obtain recovery of the consideration paid in connection with their purchase of
the Company's Class A common stock or, if they had already sold the stock,
attempt to recover losses resulting from their purchase of the Class A common
stock. The Company cannot determine the amount of Class A common stock that was
purchased by recipients of the "pre-marketing feedback" form. However, the
Company does not believe that any attempts to rescind these purchases or to
recover these losses will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations.
