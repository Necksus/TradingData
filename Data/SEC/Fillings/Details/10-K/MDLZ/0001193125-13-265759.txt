jurisdiction, and similar applicable Laws will apply to the conveyance of the Acquired Assets pursuant to this Agreement in those jurisdictions in which such Laws apply and agree to use all reasonable endeavors to secure that the conveyance is
treated neither as a supply of goods nor a supply of services. If, nevertheless, any Service Taxes are chargeable in respect of any supply in connection with the conveyance of the Acquired Assets pursuant to this Agreement, then Supplier shall
forthwith pay or procure the payment to Kraft of an amount equal to any such tax in respect of the conveyance of the Acquired Assets (in addition to the consideration or any other sum payable to Kraft) subject to the production of a valid tax
invoice in respect of such conveyance, and shall indemnify Kraft for any fines, penalties or interest imposed by any Tax Authority arising out of the treatment by Kraft and Supplier of such conveyance. Supplier warrants to Kraft that Supplier is
registered for any Service Tax or will be registered for such tax with effect from a date not later than the Commencement Date and shall, on or before that date, provide Kraft with proof of such registration reasonably satisfactory to Kraft.
Supplier warrants to Kraft that the Acquired Assets are to be used by Supplier in carrying on the same kind of business as that carried on by Kraft and Supplier will after the Commencement Date continue to carry on such business. In relation to
records pertaining to Service Taxes: (i)&nbsp;Kraft shall on the Commencement Date deliver to Supplier all records required to be so delivered under the applicable legislation; and (ii)&nbsp;Supplier shall preserve or shall procure to be preserved
those records for such period as may be required by law and during that period permit Kraft reasonable access to them to inspect or make copies of them. All sums payable in connection with the transfer of the Acquired Assets are exclusive of Service
Taxes and Supplier shall, in addition to such sums, pay any Service Taxes properly chargeable thereon, on receipt of a valid invoice for such Service Taxes. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

be modified to take account of Supplier&#146;s diminished control of the Service Levels and any change in Supplier cost structure for providing the partial set of Services. In such event, Supplier and Kraft will in good faith promptly negotiate any
Service Level or pricing adjustments required. Except as provided in a Supplement, in addition, if in connection with such a transaction, Kraft specifically requests that Supplier enter into a separate agreement with the Entity, and that Supplier
separate its systems and/or delivery organization for such Entity from that of the remainder of Kraft and the Eligible Recipients, then, in addition to any Charges for Projects approved by Kraft for such activity (including Projects to implement new
network and security requirements) and changes in costs resulting from changes in locations and System architecture, Supplier may increase its Monthly Base Charges in the aggregate by an amount equal to the additional costs Supplier will incur in
complying with Kraft's request. Except as provided in a Supplement, Services provided to such Entity pursuant to clause (i)&nbsp;of this Section shall be included in the calculation of Service volumes, if any, under this Agreement (as allocated by
Kraft). Except as provided in a Supplement, Services provided to such Entity pursuant to clause (ii)&nbsp;of this Section shall be excluded when determining any Termination Charges payable as a result of termination for convenience.

respect to the Resource Units in the Application Servers Tower that reside in Supplier Facilities or, if prior to the completion of Transition and Transformation, in the Kraft Facilities, Kraft may allocate the Charges for those Resource Units to
Eligible Recipients in the countries that are receiving the benefit of the Services reflected by those Resource Units based on an allocation formula Kraft provides to Supplier. Supplier will calculate the Charges based on the location of the

invoicing for Kraft&#146;s existing in-scope entities shall be done in accordance with the applicable Supplement. If Kraft adds business that consumes Services in a country and Supplier is not then issuing invoices to an Eligible Recipient in that
country, Kraft can require Supplier to begin issuing invoices to that country. Supplier shall issue such invoice either from a Supplier Affiliate located in the same country, or, if Supplier does not have an Affiliate in that country, from another
country as mutually agreed by Kraft and Supplier. Each invoice shall be in the form specified in <B><U>Exhibit 4</U></B> and shall (i)&nbsp;comply with all applicable legal, regulatory and accounting requirements; and (ii)&nbsp;allow Kraft to

shall be delivered to Kraft electronically (if requested by Kraft) in a form and format compatible with Kraft&#146;s accounting systems. In addition, Supplier shall provide Kraft with a database of current and detailed information regarding its
Charges, with the information in a format approved by Kraft, that can be used by Kraft to produce chargebacks by Kraft business unit. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
