     Since 1983 Minnesota Power has been diversifying to reduce its reliance 
on electricity sales to Minnesota's taconite industry and to gain additional 
earnings growth potential. Acquisitions have been a primary means of 
diversification, and this is expected to continue as the Company reinvests 
funds from its securities investment portfolio in additional businesses.

     For a detailed discussion of results of operations and trends, see 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations in the Minnesota Power 1994 Annual Report. For business segment 
information, see Note 1.

     The information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual 
report on Form 10-K reflects a categorization of the Company's business which 
is different from the categorization used in the annual report on Form 10-K 
for 1993.  Financial data from prior years has been reclassified in this 
annual report on Form 10-K to present comparable data in all periods.


                         Electric Utility Operations

     Minnesota Power's electric utility operations generate, distribute and 
sell electricity in a 26,000 square mile electric service territory located 
in northern Minnesota. On December 31, 1994, the Company was supplying retail 
electric service to 119,100 customers in 135 cities, towns and communities, 
and outlying rural areas. The largest city served is Duluth with a population 
of 85,000 based on the 1990 census. Wholesale electric service for resale is 
supplied to 13 municipal distribution systems, a private utility and to 
SWL&P. Transmission service (wheeling) is provided to 7 customers.

     Minnesota Power has three wholly owned subsidiary companies within its 
electric utility operations - SWL&P, BNI Coal and Rainy River. SWL&P provides 
electric, water and natural gas service in Superior, Wisconsin, and adjacent 
areas. As of December 31, 1994, SWL&P was supplying electric service to 
13,700 customers, water service to 9,800 customers and gas service to 10,400 
customers. BNI Coal owns and operates a lignite mine in North Dakota. Two 
electric 
                                   -1-
<PAGE>
generating cooperatives, Minnkota and Square Butte, presently 
consume virtually all of BNI Coal's production of lignite coal under coal 
supply agreements extending to 2027. Minnkota has an option to extend its 
coal supply agreement to 2042. (See - Fuel.) Rainy River is exploring 
possibilities for participation in cogeneration projects.

Electric Sales

     The Company expects that kilowatt-hour sales will remain relatively 
stable over the next five years. (See Regulatory Issues - Minnesota Public 
Utilities Commission.)

<F1> The Company's largest customers, Minntac and Hibbing Taconite, 
     represented 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of total electric 
     revenue and income in 1994, 1993 and 1992.

<F2> The Company sold 171 MW of firm energy to sales for resale customers in 
     1994. (See Regulatory Issues - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.)

</TABLE>

     In the last five years, more than 70 percent of all iron ore consumed by 
iron and steel plants in the United States has originated from within the 
Company's Minnesota electric service territory. Taconite, an iron-bearing 
rock of relatively low iron content which is abundantly available in 
Minnesota, is an important domestic source of raw material for the steel 
industry. Taconite processing plants use large quantities of electric power 
to grind the ore-bearing rock and agglomerate and pelletize the iron 
particles into taconite pellets. The taconite industry in Minnesota has had 
relatively stable production levels over the past five years. Annual 
production from the Minnesota taconite companies was 43 million tons in 1994, 
41 million tons in 1993, 40 million tons in 1992, 41 million tons in 1991, 
and 44 million tons in 1990. The Company estimates that 1995 taconite 
production will be about 48 million tons.

     Firm Large Power Customer Contracts

     The Company has power contracts which require the Company to have a 
certain amount of capacity available at all times (Firm Power) with five 
large taconite and five paper producing customers, each requiring 10 MW or 
more (Firm Large Power Customers). Contracts with these ten Firm Large Power 
Customers require payment of minimum monthly demand charges that cover most 
of the fixed costs associated with having capacity available to serve them, 
including a return on common equity. Such contracts minimize the impact on 
earnings that otherwise would result from significant reductions in kilowatt-
hour sales to such customers. These contracts, which are subject to MPUC 
approval, have a minimum contract term of ten years initially, with a four-
year 
                                   -2-
<PAGE>
cancellation notice required for termination of the contract at or 
beyond the end of the tenth year. The rates and corresponding revenue 
associated with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are 
subject to change through the same regulatory process governing all retail 
electric rates. As of March 17, 1995, the minimum annual revenue the Company 
would collect under contracts with these Firm Large Power Customers, assuming 
no electric energy use by these customers, is estimated to be $113.6, $95.7, 
$92.8, $80.2 and $61.1 million during the years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 
1999, respectively. The Company believes actual revenue received from these 
Firm Large Power Customers will be substantially in excess of the minimum 
contract amounts.

-----------------------------
The following terms are used in the contract descriptions footnoted below.

Firm demand is a take-or-pay obligation which is the sum of contract demand 
plus incremental demand.

Incremental production service is billed on an energy only basis for energy 
used above a customer's specific demand threshold. This service does not 
include a take-or-pay obligation.

Interruptible service is electrical service for a customer that may be 
interrupted by the Company under certain conditions. In return for this 
service, customers receive a reduced demand charge, but are obligated to the 
Company for future service requirements. In June 1993 the MPUC approved 100 
MW of interruptible service. In October 1994 the MPUC approved an additional 
100 MW of interruptible service to become effective May 1, 1995.

<F1> Firm contracted MW represents take-or-pay obligation for March 1995.

<F2> Eveleth Mines has firm demand through October 1999. Service requirements 
     through October 1995 are between 58 and 67 MW, from November 1995
     through October 1998 are at 51 MW, and from November 1998 through
     October 1999 are at 37.8 MW. This contract also provides $2.15 million
     of CIP funding commitments and allows Eveleth to use incremental
     production service as well as interruptible service. Beginning May 1,
     1995, 10 MW of Eveleth's firm demand will be interruptible service.
                                   -3-
<PAGE>
<F3> Hibbing Taconite has contract demand of 120.6 MW through December 2000 
     and incremental demand of  approximately 40 MW through December 1997. 
     Hibbing Taconite's firm demand includes 53 MW of interruptible service. 
     This contract also includes a CIP funding commitment of $2.1 million and 
     incremental production service for loads above 162.7 MW. Beginning May 
     1, 1995, Hibbing Taconite's firm demand will include another 28 MW of 
     interruptible service.

<F4> Inland has contract demand of 34 MW and incremental demand of between 9 
     and 11 MW through October 1997. Inland's firm demand includes 18 MW of 
     interruptible service.

<F5> Minntac (USX) has contract demand of 150.4 MW through December 1995, 
     incremental demand of between 50.6 and 52.6 MW through April 1995, and 
     contract demand of 95 MW from January 1996 through April 1999. This 
     contract also includes a CIP funding commitment of $1.85 million and 
     provides for incremental production service for loads in excess of 203 
     MW. Beginning May 1, 1995, 21 MW of Minntac's firm demand will be 
     interruptible service.

<F6> National has firm demand of 85 MW (63 MW of contract demand and 22 MW of 
     incremental demand) through October 2004. An amendment incorporating 
     incremental production service over 85 MW and updating the interruptible 
     service provision is subject to MPUC approval. Beginning May 1, 1995, 39 
     MW of National's firm demand will be interruptible service.

<F7> Blandin Paper has contract demand of 37.5 MW and incremental demand of 
     13.1 MW through December 2003.

<F8> LSPI has contract demand of 38 MW, incremental demand of 10 MW, and 
     incremental production service above 52 MW through December 2005. LSPI's 
     firm demand includes 29 MW of interruptible service and beginning May 1, 
     1995, will include another 2 MW of interruptible service.

<F1> Participation power purchase contracts require the Company to pay the 
     demand charges for MW under contract and an energy charge for each MWh 
     purchased. The selling entity is obligated to provide energy as 
     scheduled by the Company from the generating unit specified in the 
     contract as energy is available from that unit.

<F2> The Company has a contract which extends through 2007 to purchase 71 
     percent of the output of a generating plant owned by Square Butte which 
     is capable of generating up to 455 MW. Reductions to about 49 percent of 
     the output are provided for in the contract and, at the option of Square 
     Butte, could begin after a five-year advance notice to the Company. The 
     cost of the power and energy purchased is a proportionate share of 
     Square Butte's fixed obligations and operating costs based on the 
     percentage of the total output purchased by the Company. The annual 
     fixed lease obligations of the Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million 
     from 1995 through 1999. The variable obligation consists of operating 
     costs which are not incurred unless production takes place. The Company 
     is responsible for paying all costs and expenses of Square Butte 
     (including leasing, operating and any debt service costs) if not paid by 
     Square Butte when due. These obligations and responsibilities of the 
     Company are absolute and unconditional, whether or not any power is 
     actually delivered to the Company. (See Note 10.)

Fuel

     The Company has experienced no difficulty in obtaining an adequate fuel 
supply. The Company purchases low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder 
River Basin coal field located in Montana and Wyoming to meet substantially 
all of its coal supply requirements. Coal consumption for electric generation 
at the Company's Minnesota coal-fired generating stations in 1994 was about 
3.4 million tons. As of December 31, 1994, the Company had a coal inventory 
of about 410,000 tons. During 1994, the Company obtained its coal through 
both long- and short-term agreements. A long-term agreement (January 1993 
through May 1997) with Big Sky Coal Company enables the Company to purchase 
up to 2.5 million tons of coal on an annualized basis from the Big Sky Mine. 
The Company also obtained coal under one-year agreements from Kennecott 
Energy Company's Spring Creek Mine, Western Energy Company's Rosebud Mine, 
and additional coal from Big Sky Coal Company's Big Sky Mine. In August 1994 
the Company entered into a separate agreement (November 1994 through May 
1997) with Big Sky Coal Company to purchase an additional 600,000 tons of 
coal on an annualized basis from the Big Sky Mine. The Company will obtain 
coal in 1995 under similar one-year agreements with Kennecott Energy Company 
and Western Energy Company and will continue to obtain coal under its long-
term agreements with Big Sky Coal Company. This mix of coal supply options 
allows the Company to reduce market risk and to take advantage of favorable 
spot market prices. 
                                   -5-
<PAGE>
The Company is exploring future coal supply options and believes that 
adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be 
available.

     Burlington Northern Railroad transports the coal by unit train from 
Montana or Wyoming to the Company's generating stations. The Company and 
Burlington Northern Railroad have two long-term coal freight-rate contracts 
that have been in effect since January 1, 1993. These contracts substantially 
lowered the delivered price of coal to Minnesota Power. The contracts provide 
for coal deliveries through 2002 to Laskin and through 2003 to Boswell. The 
Company also has a contract with the Duluth Missabe & Iron Range Railway 
which is the final destination short-hauler to Laskin. This contract, which 
has been in effect since October 15, 1992, also substantially lowered the 
delivered price of coal and provides for deliveries through 2002. The 
delivered price of coal is subject to periodic adjustments in freight rates.

     The generating unit operated by Square Butte, which is capable of 
generating up to 455 MW, burns North Dakota lignite that is being supplied by 
BNI Coal, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to the terms of 
a contract expiring in 2027. Square Butte's cost of lignite burned in 1994 
was approximately 56 cents per million Btu. The lignite acreage that has been 
dedicated to Square Butte by BNI Coal is located on lands essentially all of 
which are under private control and presently leased by BNI Coal. This 
lignite supply is sufficient to provide the fuel for the anticipated useful 
life of the generating unit. Under the various agreements with Square Butte, 
the Company is unconditionally obligated to pay all costs not paid by Square 
Butte when due. These costs include the price of lignite purchased under a 
cost-plus contract from BNI Coal. (See Item 2. Properties and Note 10.) BNI 
Coal has experienced no difficulty in supplying all of Square Butte's lignite 
requirements.

Regulatory Issues

     The Company and its subsidiaries are exempt from regulation under the 
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, except as to Section 9(a)(2) 
which relates to acquisition of securities of public utility companies.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of 
various regulatory authorities. The MPUC has regulatory authority over 
Minnesota Power's retail rates, issuance of securities and other matters. The 
FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the 
establishment of rates and charges for the sale of electricity for resale, 
and certain accounting and record keeping practices. The PSCW has regulatory 
authority over the retail sales of electricity, water and gas by SWL&P. The 
MPUC, FERC and PSCW had regulatory authority over 55 percent, 6 percent, and 
5 percent, respectively, of the Company's 1994 total operating revenue and 
income.

     Electric Rates

     The Company has historically designed its electric service rates based 
on cost of service studies under which allocations are made to the various 
classes of customers. Nearly all retail 
                                   -6-
<PAGE>
sales include billing adjustment clauses which adjust electric service rates 
for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy, and recovery of current 
and deferred CIP expenditures.

     The Company's current policy for all contracts with Firm Large Power 
Customers is to require a minimum initial contract term of ten years with the 
term perpetuated thereafter (continuous term) subject to a minimum 
cancellation notice of four years. The Company's Firm Power rate schedules 
are designed to recover the fixed costs of providing Firm Power to Firm Large 
Power Customers, including a return on common equity, regardless of the 
amount of power or energy actually used. A Firm Large Power Customer's 
monthly demand charge obligation in any particular month is determined based 
upon the greater of its actual demand for electricity or the firm demand 
amount. Contract and rate schedule provisions provide for adjustment if the 
customer's firm demand amount is set significantly below the customer's 
actual electric requirements. The rates and corresponding revenue associated 
with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change 
through the regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. Contracts 
with eight of the ten Firm Large Power Customers provide for deferral without 
interest or diminishment of one-half of demand charge obligations incurred 
during the first three months of a strike or illegal walkout at a customer's 
facilities, with repayment required over the 12-month period following 
resolution of the work stoppage.

     The Company also has contracts with large industrial customers who 
require less than 10 MW of capacity (Large Light and Power Customers). The 
terms of these contracts vary depending upon the customers' demand for power 
and the cost of extending the Company's facilities to provide electric 
service. Generally, the contracts for less than 3 MW have one-year terms and 
the contracts ranging from 3 to 10 MW have initial five-year terms. The 
Company's rate schedule for Large Light and Power Customers is designed to 
minimize fluctuations in revenue and to recover a significant portion of the 
fixed costs of providing service to such customers.

     The Company requires that all large industrial and commercial customers 
under contract specify the date when power is first required, and thereafter 
the customer is billed for at least the minimum power for which it 
contracted. These conditions are part of all contracts covering power to be 
supplied to new large industrial and commercial customers and to current 
contract customers as their contracts expire or are amended. All contracts 
provide that new rates which have been approved by appropriate regulatory 
authorities will be substituted immediately for obsolete rates, without 
regard to any unexpired term of the existing contract. All rate schedules are 
subject to approval by appropriate regulatory authorities.

     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

     Twelve Minnesota municipalities have contracts with the Company through 
at least 2007 and three additional municipalities have contracts through 
1999. Thirteen of these contracts have caps of about 2 percent per year 
(including fuel costs) on rate increases. The other two municipal customers 
signed amendments under which the Company will provide exclusive brokering 
service for the municipalities' purchases of economy energy and will supply 
emergency, scheduled outage and firm energy as required through 1999. In 
1994, 11 municipal customers purchased 76 MW of Firm Power.

     In September 1988 the FERC approved a contract between Minnesota Power 
and SWL&P which provides for SWL&P to purchase its power from the Company 
through at least 1999 and incorporates the same cap on future rate increases 
as discussed above. The Company also has a contract, approved by the FERC, to 
supply electricity to Dahlberg Light and Power Company (Dahlberg) through 
December 2004. SWL&P purchased 87 MW and Dahlberg purchased 8 MW of Firm 
Power in 1994.

     The Company's hydroelectric facilities which are located in Minnesota 
are licensed by the FERC. The FERC issued an annual operating license for the 
St. Louis River hydroelectric project (88.2 MW generation capability) in 
January 1994, which is effective until a final 30-year license is issued. As 
a part of the relicensing process, the FERC issued an environmental impact 
statement  for the St. Louis River project in February 1995. A new license is 
expected in late 1995. The Company filed a draft relicensing application for 
the Pillager hydroelectric project (1.6 MW) in January 1995 and will file a 
final application in May 1995. (See Environmental Matters - Water.)

     Minnesota Public Utilities Commission

     In January 1994 the Company filed with the MPUC a request for a final 
annual rate increase for all retail electric customers aggregating $34 
million, or 11.8 percent, with a 12.5 percent return on equity. In August 
1994 the Company reduced its requested annual increase of $34 million to $27 
million for 1994 and $23 million for 1995 because of reductions in the 
projected cost of service and the addition of long-term contract commitments 
by a taconite customer. On February 17, 1994, the MPUC voted to approve the 
Company's requested annual interim rate increase of $20 million, or 7 
percent. This interim rate increase was implemented on March 1, 1994, subject 
to refund with interest, and will continue until final rates are effective.

     In November 1994 the MPUC issued an order granting the Company an 
increase in annual electric operating revenue of $19 million, or 6.4 percent, 
with an 11.6 percent return on equity. Rates for large industrial customers 
will increase less than 4 percent, while the rate for small businesses will 
increase 6.5 percent. The rate increase for residential customers will be 
phased in over three years:  13.5 percent beginning in 1995, an additional 
3.75 percent beginning January 1996 and another 3.75 percent beginning 
January 1997. The increase for large industrial users will be more than 
offset by savings in coal purchase and transportation costs. These savings 
are passed on to all customers and are the result of contracts negotiated 
with suppliers in recent years. 

     In December 1994 intervenors, including the Company, filed with the MPUC 
for reconsideration of its November 1994 order. In a March 15, 1995 order, 
the MPUC denied all material aspects of the requests for reconsideration and 
upheld the increase granted in November 1994. This order is subject to appeal 
for a 30 day period ending April 14, 1995. However, no appeals have been 
filed to date. Final rates are expected to be implemented in the second 
quarter of 1995.

     In 1994 the Company collected $17.2 million of interim revenue, subject 
to refund with interest. As of December 31, 1994, the Company had reserved 
$6.1 million of the interim rate revenue for anticipated refunds.

     In 1991 the Minnesota State Legislature passed legislation that mandates 
Minnesota electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5 percent of gross 
annual electric revenue by 1995, on CIP. In 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company 
spent $8, $4.1 and $1.8 million, respectively, on CIP and expects to spend a 
total of $8.5 million during 1995. The MPUC allows such conservation 
expenditures to be accumulated in a deferred account for recovery through 
future rates.

     In January 1994 the Company began recovering ongoing 1994 CIP 
expenditures and $8.2 million of deferred CIP expenditures incurred prior to 
December 31, 1993, through an annual billing adjustment mechanism approved by 
the MPUC. Through the adjustment the Company is allowed to recover current 
and deferred CIP expenditures and a lost margin associated with power saved 
as a result of these programs. The adjustment is revised annually to reflect 
CIP expenditures that differ from the base level included in the rate 
schedules. The Company collected $7.8 million of CIP related revenue in 1994.
                                   -8-

     In 1993 the MPUC approved 100 MW of interruptible service for Firm Large 
Power Customers. As a condition to taking advantage of the interruptible 
service, the customers agreed that, to the extent they have electric service 
requirements (other than requirements served by the customer's ownership 
share of electric generating facilities at the customer's site) in the period 
1997 through 2008, such customers will purchase from the Company not less 
than the initially certified interruptible load allocation. Also, if the 
interruptible customer is permitted in the future to obtain electric service 
from another supplier, the Company shall have the right of first refusal to 
provide an additional amount of electric service equal to the customer's 
allocated interruptible load during the eleven-year period, 1997 through 
2008. New contract amendments negotiated and approved in 1993 for Hibbing 
Taconite, Inland, and LSPI extended the contract demand terms to at least 
October 31, 1997. Of the initial 100 MW available for the interruptible 
service, Hibbing Taconite was allocated 53 MW, Inland 18 MW and LSPI 29 MW. 

     In 1994 the MPUC approved an additional 100 MW of interruptible service 
to become effective May 1, 1995. Conditions for service are similar to those 
with respect to the initial 100 MW offered, however, the period extends from 
1999 through 2010. Of the second 100 MW of interruptible service, Eveleth 
Mines was allocated 10 MW, Hibbing Taconite 28 MW, Minntac 21 MW, National 39 
MW, and LSPI 2 MW.

     Minnesota law enables the Company to offer retail customers special 
rates to meet competition from unregulated energy suppliers or cogenerators. 
The Company implemented a generation deferral rate in November 1990 for 
Boise. In March 1994 the MPUC approved an amendment to Boise's contract which 
includes extension of the generation deferral rate until December 1998. While 
this rate is lower than the normal retail rate, it provides for recovery of 
approximately $20 million over the next five years of the Company's fixed 
costs which would not have been recovered had Boise installed its own 
generating facilities. In addition, special rates were implemented to attract 
a new commercial customer that has a 1 MW load. (See Competition.)

     In 1994 the Company asked the MPUC to approve two additional rates for 
retail customers. First, an economic development rate, if approved, would 
give discounts to customers who invest in new capital improvements or 
equipment and increase electrical load on the Company's system. Second, an 
incremental sales rider has been approved which allows more flexibility for 
some customers to operate above their specified demand levels in certain 
months and pay only energy charges for the incremental load. (See 
Competition.)

     Public Service Commission of Wisconsin

     During 1993 and 1994 SWL&P received approval from the PSCW to expand its 
gas service territory to serve eight additional rural communities adjacent to 
its existing service territory. The expansion projects were completed in 1994 
at a total cost of $2.4 million.

Capital Expenditure Program

     Capital expenditures for the electric utility operations totaled $45 
million during 1994, of which $2 million was for coal operations. Internally 
generated funds were used to fund these capital expenditures.

     The Company's electric generating stations have the capacity to meet 
customer needs through the 1990s without major capacity additions or 
environmental modifications. Electric utility operations capital expenditures 
are expected to be $37 million in 1995, of which $7 million is related to 
coal operations. A total of approximately $158 million of electric utility 
operations capital expenditures is expected during the period 1996 through 
1999, of which $10 million is related to coal operations. The Company's 
estimates of such capital expenditures and the sources of financing are 
subject to continuing review and adjustment.
                                   -9-
<PAGE>
Competition

     The enactment of the Energy Policy Act resulted in an increase in the 
competitive forces that affect two of the three key elements of the electric 
utility industry, namely generation and transmission. The third element, 
distribution, remains unaffected. This legislation has resulted in a more 
competitive market for electricity in both the retail and wholesale markets.

     Minnesota Power is well-positioned to meet both retail and wholesale 
competitive forces. The Company's rates are very competitive even with the 
retail rate increase approved by the MPUC in November 1994. Many of the 
Company's wholesale and Firm Large Power Customers have extended the terms of 
their electric service agreements with the Company. As such agreements are 
extended, the Company's competitive position is enhanced. In addition to 
providing electricity to its customers, the Company offers its customers a 
wide variety of value-added services, including conservation improvement 
services, to meet their energy needs. The Company has also obtained MPUC 
approval to offer interruptible rates to Firm Large Power Customers and may 
offer competitive rates within its service territory to serve customers that 
could otherwise obtain their energy needs from an unregulated energy supplier 
or by generating their own electricity with MPUC approval.

     Retail

     Large industrial and commercial customers that have the ability to own 
and operate their own generation facilities may compete directly with the 
Company to supply their own electric needs. If these facilities are 
Qualifying Facilities (QFs), the customers that own them may require that the 
Company purchase the output from them at the Company's "avoided cost" 
pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. Additionally, these 
customers, as well as the balance of the Company's customers, may elect to 
substitute other sources of energy, such as natural gas, oil or wood, for 
various end uses rather than continuing to use electric energy. 
Municipalities may elect to serve customers of the Company lying within 
municipal boundaries, but must fully compensate the Company for its loss of 
property and revenue associated with this load. Finally, the prospect that 
large industrial customers might seek state authorization of retail wheeling 
in the future would have the effect of substantially increasing competition 
in the retail segment of the market for electricity.

     Wholesale

     The Energy Policy Act increased competition in the wholesale market by 
eliminating existing legal barriers with respect to entry into the generation 
market and with respect to the provision of transmission services. First, the 
Energy Policy Act created a new class of power producers, known as Exempt 
Wholesale Generators (EWGs). EWGs are exempt from regulation under the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and EWG sales are generally subject to 
less regulation than sales by traditional utilities. The fact that EWGs may 
include independent power producers as well as affiliates of electric 
utilities marks a further diminution of the role of electric utilities as the 
exclusive generators of electric energy. Second, the Energy Policy Act 
authorized the FERC to order utilities which own or operate transmission 
facilities to provide wholesale transmission services to or from other 
utilities or entities generating electric energy for sale or resale, provided 
that the rates charged for transmission services are recovered from the 
entity seeking the transmission service and not from the transmitting 
utility's existing wholesale, retail or transmission customers. The Energy 
Policy Act expressly prohibits the FERC from ordering a utility to provide 
retail wheeling services to any of its customers.
                                   -10-
<PAGE>
Franchises

     Minnesota Power holds franchises to construct and maintain an electric 
distribution and transmission system in 93 cities and towns located within 
its service territory. SWL&P holds franchises in 11 cities and towns within 
its service territory. The remaining cities and towns served will not grant a 
franchise or do not require a franchise to operate within their boundaries.

Environmental Matters

     The Company's electric utility operations are subject to regulation by 
various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, 
water quality, solid wastes, and other environmental matters. The Company 
considers its electric utility operations to be in substantial compliance 
with those environmental regulations currently applicable to its operations 
and believes all necessary permits to conduct such operations have been 
obtained. Except as noted below, the Company does not currently anticipate 
that its potential capital expenditures for environmental control purposes 
will be material. However, because environmental laws and regulations are 
constantly evolving, the character, scope and ultimate costs of environmental 
compliance cannot be estimated.

     Air

     The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) require 
that specified fossil-fueled generating plants meet new sulfur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxide emission standards beginning January 1, 1995 (Phase I) and 
that virtually all generating plants meet more strict emission standards 
beginning January 1, 2000 (Phase II). None of Minnesota Power's generating 
facilities are covered by the Phase I requirements of the Clean Air Act.

     The Clean Air Act creates emission allowances for sulfur dioxide based 
on formulas relating to the permitted 1985 emissions rate and a baseline of 
average fossil fuel consumed in the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. Each allowance 
is an authorization to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide, and each utility must 
have sufficient allowances to cover its annual emissions. Minnesota Power's 
generating facilities in Minnesota burn mainly low-sulfur western coal and 
Square Butte, located in North Dakota, burns lignite coal. All of these 
facilities are equipped with pollution control equipment such as scrubbers, 
baghouses or electrostatic precipitators. Phase II sulfur dioxide emission 
requirements are currently being met by Boswell Unit 4. Some moderate 
reductions in emissions may be necessary from Boswell Units 1, 2, and 3, 
Laskin Units 1 and 2, and Square Butte to meet the Phase II sulfur dioxide 
emission requirements. The Company believes it is in a good position to 
comply with the sulfur dioxide standards without extensive modifications. Any 
required reductions at the Minnesota generating facilities are expected to be 
achieved through the use of lower sulfur coal. Square Butte anticipates 
meeting any required reductions through increased use of existing scrubbers.

     The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set the nitrogen oxide limitations 
by January 1, 1997, for Phase II generating units. To meet anticipated Phase 
II nitrogen oxide limitations, the Company expects to install low-nitrogen 
oxide burner technology by the year 2000. Square Butte will be able to 
determine the costs of complying with the nitrogen oxide limitations when 
regulations applicable to this plant are promulgated by the EPA. Based on 
preliminary estimates, the costs of complying with the nitrogen oxide 
limitations for Boswell, Laskin and Hibbard are not expected to exceed $10 
million.
                                   -11-
<PAGE>
     Installation of continuous emission monitoring equipment by January 1, 
1995, is also required by the Clean Air Act for Phase II units. Boswell, 
Laskin and Hibbard installed $2.8 million of continuous emission monitoring 
(CEM) equipment, and Square Butte installed over $400,000 of CEM equipment in 
1994.

     In August 1993 the Company indicated its intent to work with the U.S. 
Department of Energy to identify appropriate activities that the Company has 
taken and additional measures that the Company may undertake on a voluntary 
basis that will result in limitations, reductions or sequestrations of 
greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. Section 1605 of the Energy Policy 
Act mandates timely and acceptable definitions of greenhouse gas accounting 
guidelines and greenhouse gas crediting guidelines. The Company has agreed to 
participate in this voluntary program provided that such participation is 
consistent with the Company's integrated resource planning process, does not 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's competitive position with 
respect to rates and costs, and continues to be acceptable to the Company's 
regulators.

     Water

     The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA), as amended by 
the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987, established 
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program. 
The FWPCA requires that NPDES permits be obtained from the EPA (or, when 
delegated, from individual state pollution control agencies) for any 
wastewater discharged into navigable waters.

     The MPCA reissued the Laskin NPDES permit on December 22, 1993. This 
permit will remain in effect until October 31, 1998. The permit contained a 
schedule of compliance which required a 57 percent reduction in the size of 
the ash disposal ponds by November 1, 1994. This work was completed in August 
1994 at a total cost of $1.1 million. Additional work is currently planned to 
begin in the second quarter of 1995 at an estimated cost of $150,000. No 
further actions are anticipated during the remainder of the permit term.

     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) operating licenses for 
several of the Company's hydroelectric facilities have been received or are 
currently undergoing relicensing by the FERC. Thirty (30) year licenses for 
Little Falls, Sylvan and Prairie River Hydroelectric Projects were issued by 
FERC in 1993 effective on January 1, 1994. The St. Louis River Project is 
currently operating under an annual license until the FERC has completed its 
environmental review of the project. Since the final environmental impact 
statement for the project was released by FERC dated February 1995, the 
Company expects that the final license will be issued sometime in late 1995. 
A final application to relicense the Pillager Project will be filed with the 
FERC by May 11, 1995. The FERC will perform an engineering, environmental and 
economic analysis of that application over a two year period prior to the 
current Pillager FERC license expiration on May 11, 1997. A new license is 
expected to be issued for this project by the FERC before the current 
expiration date. The Company believes, that although environmental 
considerations may require additional studies or higher minimum flow releases 
for fish habitat, recreation and water quality enhancement, that the 
economics of each project will not be compromised.

     Solid Waste

     The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 regulates the 
management and disposal of solid wastes. As a result of this legislation, the 
EPA has promulgated various hazardous waste rules. The Company is required to 
notify the EPA of hazardous waste activity and routinely submits the 
necessary annual reports to the EPA.
                                   -12-
<PAGE>
     In 1990 the Company was notified by the EPA and the MPCA that it had 
been named as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act pertaining to the 
cleanup of pollution at a northern Minnesota oil refinery site (Arrowhead 
Site). In 1994 a settlement proposal was reached regarding cleanup at the 
Arrowhead Site. State and federal officials have agreed cleanup should begin 
in 1995. The total costs to remediate the Arrowhead Site are currently 
estimated at $37 million. Funding under the proposal is shared by several 
governmental entities and about 130 companies. The formal request for 
approval of the settlement has been filed with the appropriate agencies. 
Under the terms of the settlement, Minnesota Power's share of remediation 
costs is approximately $314,000, which has been paid. In addition, the 
Company has spent about $600,000 to date on legal and other costs since the 
suit was initiated.

     Mining Control and Reclamation

     BNI Coal's mining operations are governed by the Federal Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. This Act, together with the rules and 
regulations adopted thereunder by the Department of the Interior, Office of 
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), governs the approval or 
disapproval of all mining permits on federally owned land and also governs 
the actions of the OSM in approving or disapproving state regulatory programs 
regulating mining activities. The North Dakota Reclamation of Strip Mined 
Lands Act and rules and regulations enacted thereunder in 1969, as 
subsequently amended by the North Dakota Mining and Reclamation Act and rules 
and regulations enacted thereunder in 1977, govern the reclamation of surface 
mined lands and are generally as stringent or more stringent than the federal 
rules and regulations. Compliance is monitored by the North Dakota Public 
Service Commission. The federal and state laws and regulations require a wide 
range of procedures including water management, topsoil and subsoil 
segregation, stockpiling and revegetation, and the posting of performance 
bonds to assure compliance. In general, these laws and regulations require 
the reclaiming of mined lands to a level of usefulness equal to or greater 
than that available before active mining.


Water Utility Operations

     Topeka, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, owns 100 percent of 
the companies described below which sell water and provide wastewater 
treatment services. These water utilities have been upgrading existing 
operations, building new facilities, acquiring new systems and seeking rate 
increases.

     .    SSU owns and operates water and wastewater treatment facilities in 
          many communities in Florida. SSU is the largest private water 
          supplier in Florida. At December 31, 1994, SSU served 104,000 water 
          customers and 44,100 wastewater treatment customers. SSU also 
          provides sanitation services to one franchise area serving 11,800 
          customers.

     .    Heater owns and operates 4 companies which provide water and 
          wastewater treatment services in North Carolina and South Carolina. 
          At December 31, 1994, these companies served 24,800 water customers 
          and 2,600 wastewater treatment customers.

     In October 1994 SSU and Sarasota County signed a purchase agreement 
regarding the threatened condemnation of the Venice Gardens water and 
wastewater facilities owned by SSU and located in Sarasota County, Florida. 
The sale for $37.6 million was completed in December 1994 adding $11.8 
million or 42 cents per share to 1994 earnings.
                                   -13-
<PAGE>
     In September 1994 SSU signed a purchase agreement to acquire the assets 
of Orange Osceola Utilities, Inc. located near Kissimmee, Florida, for 
approximately $13 million. The purchase is subject to various regulatory 
approvals prior to closing which the Company believes will be received in due 
course. In October 1994 SSU filed with the FPSC for approval of the purchase. 
The 17,450 water and wastewater connections which will be gained as a result 
of the purchase will approximate the number of connections SSU sold in the 
Venice Gardens transaction.

     In October 1994 Seabrook Island, South Carolina, residents voted to 
allow the town to purchase or acquire through eminent domain powers the 
town's current water and wastewater treatment facilities owned by Heater of 
Seabrook, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heater. Heater of Seabrook currently 
serves 3,300 customers. In January 1995 the town of Seabrook Island initiated 
an eminent domain action to take the assets of Heater of Seabrook from 
Heater. The price will be determined through court proceedings.

Regulatory Issues

     The FPSC and certain county commissions in Florida have regulatory 
authority over water and wastewater treatment services sold by SSU. The NCUC 
and the SCPSC have regulatory authority over water and wastewater treatment 
services sold by Heater and its subsidiaries. The Florida commissions had 
regulatory authority over 9 percent of the Company's 1994 total operating 
revenue and income, and the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions had 
regulatory authority over 1 percent.

     Florida Public Service Commission

     The following is a summary of SSU's rate filings with the FPSC and three 
county commissions during 1993 and 1994.

     .    Under provisions of a Florida state statute, water and wastewater 
          utilities may file with the FPSC an annual index and pass-through 
          filing designed to recover inflation costs associated with 
          operation and maintenance expenses. The intent of the statute is to 
          provide inflationary relief to utilities thus delaying or avoiding 
          the costs associated with full rate case filings. In May 1994 SSU 
          made an index and pass-through filing for its FPSC regulated 
          systems. The annual increase requested was $711,000 or a rate 
          increase of approximately 1.6 percent. In June 1994 SSU withdrew 
          the portion of the request relating to Hernando County at the 
          request of the FPSC. The FPSC approved $550,000 of the filing on an 
          annual basis and the rates became effective in July 1994.

     .    In September 1994 SSU filed a pass-through filing with the 
          Hillsborough Board of County Commissioners for a $500,000 increase 
          in wastewater rates for the Seaboard facilities. The increase was 
          effective in October 1994 and recovers costs SSU pays to the City 
          of Tampa for wastewater treatment.

     .    In December 1994 SSU filed a pass-through filing with the FPSC for 
          a $714,000 increase in water and wastewater rates for the Deep 
          Creek facilities. The increase became effective in February 1995 
          and is expected to recover costs SSU pays to Charlotte County for 
          bulk water and wastewater treatment.

     .    The FPSC ordered statewide uniform rates for 90 water and 37 
          wastewater service areas in SSU's 1992 consolidated rate filing. In 
          September 1993 the FPSC initiated a separate investigation into the 
          appropriate rate structure for SSU. The investigation was initiated 
          for the purpose of determining if, as a matter of policy, uniform 
          statewide rates are appropriate for SSU. In June 1994 the FPSC 
          issued 
                                   -14-
<PAGE>
          an order declining to issue a declaratory statement which 
          would have acknowledged FPSC jurisdiction over SSU service areas in 
          Hillsborough and Polk Counties. Instead the FPSC opened an 
          investigation to determine if SSU is a single system pursuant to 
          Florida statutes. If SSU is classified as a single system, all SSU 
          facilities operated in Florida will be subject to FPSC 
          jurisdiction. Hearings were held in January 1995, with a final 
          decision expected in June 1995.

     .    In April 1994 the Hernando County Board of County Commissioners 
          issued an order rescinding FPSC jurisdiction in Hernando County. In 
          June 1994 the FPSC issued an order acknowledging that Hernando 
          County has jurisdiction over privately-owned water and wastewater 
          facilities located in the County as of April 5, 1994. In April 1994 
          SSU filed a court action before the Florida Circuit Court for 
          Hernando County to stay the change in jurisdiction. This action 
          remains pending. In April 1994 SSU also requested the FPSC to 
          retain interim jurisdiction over SSU's facilities in Hernando 
          County until jurisdictional determinations are made by the courts. 
          In June 1994 the FPSC issued an order denying SSU's request. SSU 
          has appealed this order to Florida's First District Court of 
          Appeals. SSU believes that a jurisdictional change should not be 
          made at this time because of the FPSC investigation to determine if 
          SSU's facilities in all counties within Florida constitute a single 
          system subject to the sole jurisdiction of the FPSC.

     .    In September 1994 the Charlotte County Board of County 
          Commissioners declared that as of September 27, 1994, all water and 
          wastewater utilities in Charlotte County were subject to the 
          jurisdiction of the FPSC. The FPSC acknowledged the County action 
          in a November 1994 order and is expected to issue in 1995 a 
          Certificate of Authority to SSU for facilities located in Charlotte 
          County.

     SSU plans to file a general rate increase application with the FPSC in 
1995. New facilities added since 1992 (SSU's last general rate increase) are 
not yet included in rate base for earnings purposes. Additionally, mandated 
regulatory compliance cost increases during the same period, particularly for 
environmental protection, have increased operating expenses and should also 
be recovered in rates. The filing is expected to include water conservation 
incentives and request approval of a consistent policy on charges for service 
availability.

     North Carolina Utilities Commission and South Carolina Public Service 
Commission

     The following is a summary of Heater's pending rate filings with the 
NCUC and the SCPSC.

     .    In July 1992 Heater filed with the SCPSC for a $233,000 rate 
          increase for operations near Columbia, South Carolina. In January 
          1993 the SCPSC denied the rate increase request. In March 1993 
          Heater filed with the Circuit Court of South Carolina an appeal of 
          the SCPSC's denial of the request. In September 1993 the requested 
          rates were implemented, under surety bond, pending the decision on 
          the appeal. As a condition to the SCPSC's grant to Heater of a 
          $110,000 annual increase in May 1994, Heater was required to cease 
          charging the increased rates under surety bond. The final decision 
          on the appeal is expected in 1995 and will determine the amount of 
          the refund with interest, if any.

     .    In January 1994 Heater of Seabrook, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
          Heater, filed with the SCPSC for a $263,000 annual rate increase 
          for operations near Charleston, South Carolina. In July 1994 the 
          SCPSC denied the request for an 
                                   -15-
<PAGE>

          annual rate increase. The SCPSC treated $64,000 in availability 
          fees as revenue. Previously, the SCPSC treated these fees as a 
          reduction to rate base. This treatment resulted in an 8.6 percent 
          operating margin which the SCPSC found to be adequate. Heater of 
          Seabrook filed a motion for reconsideration in July 1994 
          maintaining that the resulting 3.98 percent return on equity is 
          inadequate. In August 1994 the SCPSC denied reconsideration. In 
          September 1994 Heater of Seabrook filed an appeal in the Circuit 
          Court of South Carolina and subsequently provided notice to the 
          customers and implemented the requested rates under surety bond in 
          January 1995, pending the final decision on the appeal.

     .    In July 1994 Upstate Heater Utilities (Upstate), a wholly owned 
          subsidiary of Heater, filed for a $71,000 annual rate increase with 
          the SCPSC. In December 1994 the SCPSC denied the request for an 
          annual rate increase primarily due to customer opposition. In 
          January 1995 Upstate filed for reconsideration and the SCPSC denied 
          the request. In February 1995 Upstate filed an appeal in the 
          Circuit Court of South Carolina.

     .    In February 1995 Heater filed for a $314,000 annual rate increase 
          with the NCUC. A hearing is scheduled for July 18, 1995.

     .    In March 1995 Brookwood Water Corporation, a wholly owned 
          subsidiary of Heater, filed with the NCUC for a $120,000 annual 
          rate increase.

Capital Expenditure Program

     Capital expenditures for the water and wastewater utility operations 
totaled $28 million during 1994. Expenditures were funded with the proceeds 
from long-term bonds issued by SSU and internally generated funds. Water 
utility capital expenditures are expected to be $26 million in 1995 for 
upgrades, water reuse projects and new water facilities, and to total 
approximately $99 million during the period 1996 through 1999.

Franchises

     SSU provides water and wastewater treatment services in 22 counties 
regulated by the FPSC and holds franchises in three counties which to date 
have retained authority to regulate such operations. SSU is contesting in a 
Florida circuit court and a Florida appellate court the authority of one of 
these three counties, Hernando County, to regulate SSU's operations. (See 
Regulatory Issues - Florida Public Service Commission.)

     All of the water and wastewater services of Heater are under the 
jurisdiction of regulatory commissions. These commissions grant franchises 
for Heater's service territory when the rates are authorized.

     In March 1995 East LA Services Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Topeka, was notified by Lee County, Florida that it would not be awarded any 
sanitation service area franchises requested as part of a proposal procedure. 
As a result, East LA Services Corporation expects to discontinue operations 
on or about September 30, 1995, the existing franchise agreement's expiration 
date. Discontinuation of this business will not be material.

Environmental Matters

     The Company's water utility operations are subject to regulation by 
various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of water quality, 
solid wastes, and other environmental matters. The Company considers its 
water utility operations to generally be in compliance with those 
                                   -16-
<PAGE>

environmental regulations currently applicable to its operations and have the 
permits necessary to conduct such operations. Except as noted below, the 
Company does not currently anticipate that its potential capital expenditures 
for environmental control purposes will be material. However, because 
environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the character, 
scope and ultimate costs of environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

     In July 1992 the EPA issued a Request for Information to SSU regarding 
operations of SSU's wastewater facilities in the Seaboard service area in 
Hillsborough County, Florida. The request was made to obtain more details 
concerning exceedances of the NPDES permit for effluent quality. Requested 
information was compiled and sent to the EPA in September 1992. In 1993 SSU 
complied with an additional Request for Information issued by the EPA. In 
1993, the EPA issued an Administrative Order regarding the violations. The 
Order required SSU to select a method to consistently meet all NPDES permit 
requirements or cease all discharges to the surface waters of the United 
States. In March 1994 SSU connected the Seaboard facilities with the City of 
Tampa's facilities and ceased discharges from the facilities to surface 
waters. SSU has received no further communication from the EPA regarding this 
matter and is unable to determine what further action, if any, may be 
required.

     In October 1992 the EPA issued an Information Request to SSU regarding 
operations of SSU's facilities in the University Shores service area in 
Orange County, Florida. The request was made to obtain more details 
concerning exceedances of the NPDES permit for effluent quality. The 
requested information was compiled and sent to the EPA in late 1992 and 
supplemented in February 1993. In February 1993 the EPA issued a Notice to 
Show Cause letter to request SSU representatives to meet in Atlanta, Georgia, 
to discuss the exceedances. SSU met with the EPA in March 1993 and received 
an additional Information Request from the EPA in April 1993. The requested 
information was supplied to the EPA in June 1993. At that time, SSU was 
attempting to determine a feasible method to eliminate surface water 
discharges allowed by the NPDES permit. After months of design and 
environmental permitting problems, SSU signed an agreement with Orange County 
Utilities (OCU) to construct an interconnect between the two collection 
systems so that a portion of the sewage flow at University Shores could be 
sent to OCU. The construction of the interconnect was completed in September 
1994 thereby allowing SSU to eliminate effluent discharges by the University 
Shores facilities to surface waters. Additional information on the project 
was requested by EPA in November 1994 and SSU supplied the requested 
information to the EPA in December 1994.

     In September 1993 the EPA issued an Administrative Order to SSU 
regarding operations of SSU's facilities in the Woodmere service area in 
Duval County, Florida (Woodmere facilities). The Order requires monthly 
toxicity testing of the effluent for at least one year because of toxicity 
test failures during 1992 and 1993. In September 1994, because of additional 
1993 and 1994 toxicity test failures at the Woodmere facilities, the EPA 
required implementation of a Toxicity Reduction Evaluation (TRE) plan to 
determine the cause of the toxicity. The TRE plan is expected to take 
approximately 15 months to complete.

     In August 1994 the EPA issued an Administrative Order to SSU regarding 
operations of SSU's facilities in the Beacon Hills service area in Duval 
County. The Order requires monthly toxicity testing of the effluent because 
of toxicity test failures during 1993 and 1994.

     SSU and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) 
completed negotiations in 1994 on five consent orders involving water and 
wastewater facilities within SSU's system resulting in penalties and 
reimbursement totaling approximately $27,000. Three additional consent orders 
with proposed penalties of approximately $25,000 are being negotiated with 
the FDEP. 
                                   -17-

     In 1994 SSU invested approximately $11.2 million of a $23.6 million 
annual capital expenditure budget (or approximately 47.5 percent) in 
facilities necessary to comply with environmental requirements. In 1995 SSU 
expects that approximately $9.4 million of the $20.8 million annual capital 
expenditure budget (or approximately 45 percent) will be necessary to comply 
with environmental requirements.

                    Investments and Corporate Services

     Non-regulated investments supplement Minnesota Power's earnings and, in 
some cases, perform an economic development function in Minnesota Power's 
electric utility service area. These investments include a portfolio of 
securities investments managed by Minnesota Power which are intended to 
provide funds for reinvestment and business acquisitions. Considered a part 
of the portfolio, the Company owns a 22.1 percent equity investment in a 
financial guaranty reinsurance company. Additionally, the Company owns an 80 
percent interest in a real estate company in Florida, a 50 percent interest 
in a Duluth paper making mill, an 88 percent interest in a Duluth plant which 
produces recycled pulp and an 82.5 percent interest in a Duluth manufacturer 
of specialized truck-mounted lifting equipment.

     .    As of December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately $202 million 
          in a portfolio of securities investments. The majority of the 
          securities investments are investment grade stocks of other utility 
          companies and are considered by the Company to be conservative 
          investments. Additionally, the Company sells common stock 
          securities short and enters into short sales of treasury futures 
          contracts as part of an overall investment portfolio hedge 
          strategy. Selling common stock securities short and entering into 
          treasury futures contracts create off-balance-sheet market risk to 
          the Company. At December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately 
          $61.5 million of short stock sales outstanding and $31.7 million of 
          treasury futures contracts. (See Note 4.)

     .    At December 31, 1994, Minnesota Power had a $72.1 million equity 
          investment which represented a 21.4 percent ownership interest in 
          Capital Re, a Delaware holding company engaged in financial and 
          mortgage guaranty reinsurance through its wholly owned 
          subsidiaries, Capital Reinsurance Company and Capital Mortgage 
          Reinsurance Company. Capital Reinsurance Company is a reinsurer of 
          financial guarantees of municipal and non-municipal debt 
          obligations. Capital Mortgage Reinsurance Company is a reinsurer of 
          residential mortgage guaranty insurance. In 1994 the Company 
          purchased an additional 417,100 shares of Capital Re common stock 
          for $8.8 million. (See Note 5.) In March 1995 the Company purchased 
          another 100,000 shares of Capital Re common stock for $2.2 million 
          increasing the Company's ownership interest to 22.1 percent. 

     .    The Company, through Topeka, acquired a two-thirds ownership 
          interest in Lehigh, a real estate company which owns various real 
          estate properties and operations in Florida, for $6 million in July 
          1991. In June 1993 the Company issued 140,648 shares of common 
          stock, with a market value at the time of issuance of approximately 
          $4.9 million, in exchange for an additional 13.4 percent ownership 
          in Lehigh bringing the Company's total ownership interest in Lehigh 
          to 80 percent. Real estate properties and operations are being sold 
          over the next several years. The acquisition was accounted for 
          under the purchase method and has been consolidated with the 
          Company since July 1991.
     
     .    Minnesota Paper, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a 50 
          percent participant in LSPI, a joint venture with Pentair Duluth 
          Corp., a subsidiary of 
                                   -18-
<PAGE>
          St. Paul based Pentair, Inc. LSPI operates a paper mill in Duluth 
          which produces supercalendered paper. (See Note 5.)

     .    UtilEquip, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has an 82.5 
          percent ownership interest in Reach All. Located in Duluth, Reach 
          All manufactures specialized truck-mounted lifting equipment used 
          by utilities and governmental entities.

     .    Synertec, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is pursuing 
          opportunities in ventures relating to energy efficiency, resource 
          conservation such as recycling and solid waste management, and 
          pollution prevention.

     .    SRFI, a joint venture owned 88 percent by subsidiaries of the 
          Company and 12 percent by a subsidiary of Pentair, Inc., built a 
          $78 million plant in Duluth that produces pulp from recycled office 
          scrap paper. Commercial operations began at SRFI in November 1993. 
          The plant has the capacity to produce 90,000 tons of recycled pulp 
          annually and has commitments from paper producers to purchase up to 
          82 percent of its output under multi-year contracts.

     In January 1995 the Company and ADESA jointly announced that they had 
entered into a letter of intent outlining terms of a merger under which ADESA 
will become an 80 percent-owned subsidiary of Minnesota Power in return for 
payment of $167 million. ADESA, headquartered in Indianapolis, owns and 
operates auto redistribution facilities and performs related services through 
which used cars and other vehicles are sold by automobile manufacturers, 
franchised automobile dealers, fleet/lease companies, and licensed used car 
dealers. Pursuant to the proposed merger, all shareholders of ADESA, other 
than certain officers with respect to a portion of their shares, will receive 
$17.00 in cash for each share of their ADESA common stock. In February 1995 a 
merger agreement was signed along with employment agreements with ADESA's 
four top managers, and put and call agreements. The put and call agreements 
provide ADESA management the right to sell to Minnesota Power, and Minnesota 
Power the right to purchase, ADESA management's 20 percent retained ownership 
interest in ADESA, in increments during the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, at a 
price based on ADESA's financial performance. The transaction is scheduled to 
be completed during the second quarter of 1995 subject to, among other 
things, approval of the transaction by ADESA's shareholders and satisfaction 
of other customary conditions. It is anticipated that a portion of the 
Company's securities portfolio will be used to fund the ADESA purchase.

     In September 1994 Pentair, Inc., the Company's joint-venture partner in 
LSPI, announced its desire to exit the paper business, which would likely 
include selling LSPI. The Company would participate in a sale under the right 
conditions. If LSPI is sold, it may be logical to also consider a 
simultaneous sale of SRFI, whose paper recycling/pulp production plant is 
adjacent to and operated by LSPI.

     In March 1995 based on the results of a project which analyzed the 
economic feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the 
Company, the board of directors of Lehigh directed Lehigh Corporation, a 
subsidiary of Lehigh, to dispose of its assets in a manner that would 
maximize utilization of the tax benefits. As a result of the project findings 
and the board's directive, Lehigh will reduce a $26.2 million valuation 
allowance against its deferred tax assets to $7.8 million and recognize $18.4 
million in income. The Company's portion will be $14.7 million or 52 cents 
per share in income in the first quarter of 1995.

     The Company anticipates exiting the specialized truck-mounted lifting 
equipment business in 1995 and is reviewing its alternatives to accomplish 
this objective. In anticipation of 
                                   -19-
<PAGE>
that action, a loss, estimated to range from $3 to $5 million, after tax, 
will be reflected in the Company's first quarter 1995 earnings.

Capital Expenditure Program

     Capital expenditures for investments and corporate services businesses 
totaled approximately $8 million during 1994. These expenditures included 
approximately $3 million for construction of the pulp production plant and 
approximately $5 million for affordable housing. Capital expenditures for the 
investments and corporate services businesses are expected to be $1.5 million 
in 1995 and total approximately $8.7 million during the period 1996 through 
1999.

Environmental Matters

     Certain of the Company's investments and corporate services businesses 
are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in 
the areas of air quality, water quality, solid wastes, and other 
environmental matters. The Company considers these businesses to be in 
substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently 
applicable to its operations and believes all necessary permits to conduct 
such operations have been obtained. The Company does not currently anticipate 
that its potential capital expenditures for environmental control purposes 
will be material. However, because environmental laws and regulations are 
constantly evolving, the character, scope and ultimate costs of environmental 
compliance cannot be estimated.

          The Company has electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 
kilovolts (kV) (7.8 miles), 230 kV (606.4 miles), 161 kV (42.8 miles), 138 kV 
(5.8 miles), 115 kV (1,239.6 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,001.3 miles). The 
Company owns and operates 180 substations with a total capacity of 8,545.7 
megavoltamperes. Some of the transmission and distribution lines interconnect 
with other utilities.

     The Company owns and has a substantial investment in offices and service 
buildings, area headquarters, an energy control center, repair shops, motor 
vehicles, construction equipment and tools, office furniture and equipment, 
and leases offices and storerooms in various localities within the Company's 
service territory. It also owns miscellaneous parcels of real estate not 
presently used in utility operations.

     Substantially all of the electric utility plant of the Company is 
subject to the lien of its Mortgage and Deed of Trust which secures first 
mortgage bonds issued by the Company. The Company's properties are held by it 
in fee and are free from other encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, 
none of which are of such a nature as to substantially impair the usefulness 
to the Company of such properties. Other property, including certain offices 
and equipment, is utilized under leases. In general, some of the electric 
lines are located on land not owned in fee, but are covered by necessary 
consents of various governmental authorities or by appropriate rights 
obtained from owners of private property. These consents and rights are 
deemed adequate for the purposes for which the properties are being used. In 
September 1990 the Company sold a portion of Boswell Unit 4 to WPPI. WPPI has 
the right to use the Company's transmission line facilities to transport its 
share of generation.

utilities including the Company, eight rural electric generation and 
transmission cooperatives, three public power districts, four municipal 
electric systems, four municipal organizations, and the Western Area Power 
Administration - Billings, Montana. MAPP operates pursuant to an agreement, 
dated March 31, 1972, as amended, among its members. This agreement provides 
for the members to coordinate the installation and operation of generating 
plants and transmission line facilities.

     Manitoba Hydro has export licenses from the National Energy Board in 
Calgary until November 1, 2005, to export up to 16.7 billion kilowatt-hours a 
year of energy and short-term firm hydroelectric power to other Canadian 
utilities and four utility companies in the United States, including the 
Company. Manitoba Hydro presently exports approximately 12 billion kilowatt-
hours a year. When it is available and economical, the Company purchases 
energy and power from Manitoba Hydro that can be delivered through Minnesota 
Power's transmission lines.

                         ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE


To the Board of Directors
  of Minnesota Power

     Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our 
report dated January 24, 1995, appearing on page 24 of the 1994 Annual Report 
to Shareholders of Minnesota Power (which report and consolidated financial 
statements are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) 
also included an audit of the Financial Statement Schedule listed in Item 
14(a) of this Form 10-K. In our opinion, the Financial Statement Schedule 
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein 
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

                               INCENTIVE PLAN

                              MINNESOTA POWER
                      EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
            (Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 1994)



I.        EFFECTIVE DATE

     This amended and restated Minnesota Power & Light Company (Company) 
Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (Plan) for a select group of management or 
highly compensated executive employees is made effective as of January 1, 1994. 
Effective January 1, 1994, participation in the Plan was extended to the 
responsibility level of Salary Grade V.  This Plan supersedes and replaces the 
Minnesota Power Long-Term Incentive Plan dated January 1, 1992.


II.       PURPOSES OF THE PLAN

     The purposes of the Plan are:

     1.   To reward focusing on long-term planning and results.

     2.   To link compensation with enhancement of shareholder value.



III.      CONCEPT

     At the beginning of each new Performance Period, eligible key executives 
will be granted a maximum Performance Award Opportunity expressed as a number 
of shares of the Company's common stock, not to exceed the designated maximum 
for that position.  The extent to which the Award Opportunity is earned (e.g., 
the number of shares earned) depends on the Company's performance in terms of 
stock price appreciation plus dividends in relation to the comparator groups 
during the Performance Period.   The Performance Period will be four calendar 
years and the actual value of the shares earned will depend upon the price of 
the Company's common stock at the end of the fourth calendar year.

                                   1
<PAGE>
     Illustrated below, Performance Period 1 began January 1, 1991, and will 
end December 31, 1994. A new Performance Period will begin every year as shown.

IV.       ELIGIBILITY

     Participation is restricted to certain key executives.   Participants are  
divided into five groups (Participant Categories) to reflect varying 
responsibility levels as follows:

          V                                  V
</TABLE>

V.        AWARD OPPORTUNITY

     A maximum Performance Award Opportunity has been established for each 
Participant Category.  The Performance Award Opportunity is stated as a maximum 
number of shares of common stock of the Company.  If a Participant's 
Responsibility Level changes during the Performance Period, or if a participant 
first becomes eligible during a Performance Period, the Award Opportunity will 
be

                                   2
<PAGE>
prorated or adjusted as determined by the Executive Compensation Committee.  
For Performance Periods 1, 2 and 3 illustrated in Section III, Performance 
Award Opportunities will be based on the following schedule:

</TABLE>

VI.       PERFORMANCE MEASURE

     The Company's long-term performance will be measured by its Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) Ranking over each four-year Performance Period.  TSR 
is defined as:

     TSR = Stock Price Appreciation + Reinvested Dividends
           -----------------------------------------------
                      Initial Stock Price

                                   3
<PAGE>
     The TSR is determined by means of combining the change in stock price over 
the entire Performance Period with dividends which are assumed to be reinvested 
on each ex-dividend date.  Key assumptions to be followed in calculation of TSR 
are:

     1)   Stock prices used with respect to a performance Period are the 
          closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last day 
          before the beginning of the Performance Period and the last day of 
          the Performance Period.

     2)   Dividends are assumed to be reinvested on the ex-
          dividend date at the closing stock prices on that
          date.
     
     3)   Calculation of TSR for the S&P 500 group is based
          on the companies included in the S&P 500 as of the
          end of Performance Period.

     The current performance measure will be reviewed at the beginning of each 
new Performance Period to determine that it remains applicable and effective.  
A new performance measure may be adopted at any time by amending this Plan. 


VII.      COMPARATOR GROUPS

     The TSR performance measure discussed above will be used to rank the 
Company's performance relative to two comparator groups on a 60/40 weighted 
basis.  The first comparator group (weighted 60% in the award computation) will 
consist of the 10 regional utility companies that are used in the Minnesota 
Power and Affiliated Companies Incentive Compensation Plan.  At the end of each 
Performance Period, all companies, including the Company, will be ranked from 1 
to 11, according to TSR. 

     The second comparator group (weighted at 40% in the award computation) 
will include a broader group of companies comprising the S&P 500.  Comparison 
against this group will be based on the TSR percentile ranking of the Company 
among the S&P 500, at the end of each Performance Period.

                                   4
<PAGE>
VIII.     AWARD DETERMINATION

     After calculation of the Company's TSR ranking within the utility industry 
comparator group and the S&P 500, the schedule below will prescribe the percent 
of the Participant's Performance Award Opportunity actually earned.  The 
Performance Award Opportunity shall be as specified in Section V above.

</TABLE>
                              TSR Percentile Ranking in S&P 500

     Straight line interpolation will be used for TSR Percentile Ranking 
results between those discrete values specified in the table (no interpolation 
is necessary regarding the Industry TSR Ranking).

     Final awards will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Compensation 
Committee.  Each Participant's award amount will be the product obtained by 
multiplying the Participant's Performance Award Opportunity shares as 
determined at the beginning of the Performance Period by the appropriate 
weighted percentages.

IX.       EXAMPLE CALCULATION OF AWARDS

     Assume a Participant's Performance Award Opportunity is 4,000 shares at 
the beginning of the Performance Period.  Assume further, that at the end of 
the four-year Performance Period, the Company ranks fifth in its Industry TSR 
Ranking and is at the 75th percentile among the S&P 500 comparator group. The 
award would be computed as follows:

     Opportunity    Industry       S&P 500            Final
        Shares      Ranking        Ranking        Shares Awarded

         4,000   x  (24%      +      28%)    =         2,080.

                                   5
<PAGE>
X.        PAYMENT OPTIONS

     As soon as practicable following the end of the last year of the 
Performance Period and upon approval of the Executive Compensation Committee, 
awards will be paid totally in stock or in a combination of stock and cash (up 
to a maximum of fifty percent cash) at the election of the Participant.  At the 
time awards are determined and approved, a Participant may elect on a form 
provided by the Company to receive payment of up to fifty percent of the 
approved award in cash.


XI.       TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     Awards to the CEO and COO will continue to run after their retirement 
without any proration or reduction for the fact that retirement occurs before a 
performance period has ended.

     In the event of death, disability or retirement of any Participant prior 
to the end of a four-year Performance Period, the provisions in the paragraphs 
below will apply unless the Executive Compensation Committee makes an exception 
and elects in its discretion to continue the award.

     If termination of employment due to death, disability, or retirement 
occurs (except as noted above for the CEO and COO in the event of retirement) 
prior to the end of a Performance Period, the Participant's performance award 
will be paid as soon as practicable after the end of the year of such 
termination.  The final award determination will be calculated as provided in 
Section VIII above, after the end of such year (as if it were the end of the 
four-year Performance Period).  The award will then be multiplied by a prorated 
adjustment factor, the numerator of which is the number of months the 
Participant was employed by the Company during the Performance Period rounded 
up to whole months and the denominator of which is 48.  The result thus 
obtained will be the actual final award to be provided by the Company to a 
Participant or his/her beneficiary or estate if no beneficiary is named. 
Notwithstanding any provisions in this Plan to the contrary, any payment to any 
beneficiary may be withheld until it is determined if any generation-skipping 
tax is due.  Any amounts necessary to pay such tax may be subtracted from any 
benefits otherwise due.

                                   6
<PAGE>
     Termination of employment for reasons other than death, disability, or 
retirement before the end of a Performance Period will  result in forfeiture of 
the associated award opportunity unless an exception is made by the Executive 
Compensation Committee.


XII.      ADMINISTRATION

     The administration of the Plan will be under the overall responsibility of 
the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Chief 
Executive Officer will be responsible for administering the Plan (computing 
awards, measuring performance of the comparator group, etc.).  Any revisions to 
the Plan will require review by the Executive Compensation Committee and 
approval of the Board of Directors.  The Chief Executive Officer will involve 
other individuals and departments as required for the full and complete 
administration of the Plan, in accordance with its terms.


XIII.     NON-TRANSFERABILITY

     In no event shall the Company make any payment under the Plan to any 
assignee or creditor of a Participant or of a Participant's beneficiary.  Prior 
to the time of payment hereunder, a Participant or beneficiary shall have no 
rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of 
any interest under the Plan nor shall such rights be assigned or transferred by 
operation of law.


XIV.      CLAIMS PROCEDURE

     A)   Filing a Claim
          --------------

     Any Participant or beneficiary, or his/her authorized representative, may 
make a claim for benefits due under the Plan by making a written request 
therefor to the Executive Compensation Committee, setting forth with 
specificity the facts and events which give rise to the claim.

                                   7
<PAGE>
     b)   Denial of Claim
          ---------------

     The Executive Compensation Committee shall notify in writing any 
Participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits hereunder is denied.  Said 
notice shall be furnished within ninety days after the Executive Compensation 
Committee receives the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension 
of time for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time for processing 
is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the 
Participant or beneficiary prior to the termination of the initial ninety-day 
period.  In no event shall such extension exceed a period of ninety days from 
the end of such initial period.  The notice of extension shall indicate the 
special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the 
Executive Compensation Committee expects to render the final decision.  The 
notice of claim denial shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial, 
including specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions.  If appropriate, 
said notice shall set forth any additional information the Participant or 
beneficiary needs to supply in order to perfect his/her claim.  The notice 
shall also inform the Participant or beneficiary of the review procedure 
available pursuant to this Section, and of his/her right to inspect pertinent 
documents.

     c)   Review Of Claim Denial
          ----------------------

     A Participant or beneficiary who desires further consideration of his/her 
position, or a duly authorized representative, shall, within sixty days of 
receipt of the notice above referred to, make written request to the Executive 
Compensation Committee for review of such denial. Such request shall include a 
statement of the Participant's or beneficiary's position.  The Executive 
Compensation Committee shall make a full and fair review of the decision 
denying the claim, and shall deliver to the Participant or beneficiary a 
written statement setting forth its decision and the specific reasons therefor, 
including specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions, within sixty days 
after receiving the request for review (unless special circumstances require an 
extension of time for processing, in which case written notice of the extension 
shall be furnished to the Participant or beneficiary prior to the commencement 
of the extension and a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not 
later than 120 days after receiving the request for review).

                                   8
<PAGE>
XV.       EXPENSES

     The cost of payments from the Plan and the expense of administering the 
Plan shall be borne by the Company.

XVI.      TAX WITHHOLDING

     The Company shall have the right to deduct from all payments to be made 
under the Plan, any federal, state or local taxes or other charges required by 
law to be withheld with respect to such payments.


XVII.     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     The Company expects the Plan to continue, but since future conditions 
affecting the Company cannot be anticipated or foreseen, the Company must and 
does hereby reserve the right to amend, modify, terminate or partially 
terminate the Plan at any time and in any manner whatsoever by recommendation 
of the Executive Compensation Committee and by action of the Board of 
Directors. No amendment or termination may divest a Participant of amounts 
accrued or credited to the Participant at the time of such amendment.


XVIII.    APPLICABLE LAW

     The Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of Minnesota.  The invalidity of any portion of the Plan shall not 
invalidate the remainder hereof and said remainder shall continue in full 
force. The captions and other titles herein are designed for convenience only 
and are not to be resorted to for the purpose of interpreting any provision of 
the Plan.


XIX.      NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS

     The Plan and elections hereto shall not be deemed or construed to be a 
written contract of employment between any Participant and the Company, nor 
shall any provision of the Plan (i) restrict the right of the Company to 
discharge any Participant or (ii) in any way whatsoever grant to any 
Participant the right to receive any 

                                   9
<PAGE>
guaranteed salary, bonus, incentive compensation award or any other payments of 
any nature whatsoever.


XX.       BINDING AGREEMENT

     The provisions of the plan shall be binding upon the Participant, his or 
her heirs, personal representatives and beneficiaries, and subject to the 
rights granted to amend or terminate the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall 
also be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns.


XXI.      CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

     It is intended that the Company is under a contractual obligation to make 
payments to Participants or their beneficiaries from the general funds and 
assets of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.  
A Participant or his/her beneficiary shall have no rights to such payments, 
other than as a general, unsecured creditor of the Company.

                               INCENTIVE PLAN

                              MINNESOTA POWER
                    DIRECTORS' LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
              (Amended and restated effective January 1, 1994)


I.        EFFECTIVE DATE

     The Minnesota Power Directors' Long-Term Incentive Plan (Plan) for members 
of the Board of Directors of Minnesota Power & Light Company (Company) is made 
effective as of January 1, 1994.  This Plan supersedes and replaces the 
Minnesota Power Directors' Long Term Incentive Plan dated January 1, 1992.


II.       PURPOSES OF THE PLAN

     The purposes of the Plan are:

     1.   To reward focusing on long-term planning and results.

     2.   To link compensation with enhancement of shareholder value.


III.      CONCEPT

     At the beginning of each new Performance Period, Directors will be granted 
a maximum Performance Award Opportunity of up to 600 shares of the Company's 
common stock.  The extent to which the Award Opportunity is earned (e.g., the 
number of shares earned) depends on the Company's performance in terms of stock 
price appreciation plus dividends in relation to the comparator groups during 
the Performance Period.   The Performance Period will be four calendar years 
and the actual value of the shares earned will depend upon the price of the 
Company's common stock at the end of the fourth calendar year.

                                   1

<PAGE>
     Performance Periods will begin every other year as illustrated below.

IV.       PERFORMANCE MEASURE

     The Company's long-term performance will be measured by its Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) Ranking over each four-year Performance Period.  TSR 
is defined as:

     TSR = Stock Price Appreciation + Reinvested Dividends
           -----------------------------------------------
                       Initial Stock Price

     The TSR is determined by means of combining the change in stock price over 
the entire Performance Period with dividends which are assumed to be reinvested 
on each ex-dividend date.  Key assumptions to be followed in calculation of TSR 
are:

     1)   Stock prices used with respect to a performance Period are the 
          closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last day before 
          the beginning of the Performance Period and the last day of the 
          Performance Period.

     2)   Dividends are assumed to be reinvested on the ex-dividend date at 
          the closing stock prices on that date.
     
     3)   Calculation of TSR for the S&P 500 group is based on the companies 
          included in the S&P 500 as of the end of Performance Period.

     The current performance measure will be reviewed at the beginning of each 
new Performance Period to determine that it 

                                   2

<PAGE>
remains applicable and effective.  A new performance measure may be adopted at 
any time by amending this Plan. 


V.        COMPARATOR GROUPS

     The TSR performance measure discussed above will be used to rank the 
Company's performance relative to two comparator groups on a 60/40 weighted 
basis.  The first comparator group (weighted 60% in the award computation) will 
consist of the 10 regional utility companies that are used in the Minnesota 
Power and Affiliated Companies Incentive Compensation Plan.  At the end of each 
Performance Period, all companies, including the Company, will be ranked from 1 
to 11, according to TSR. 

     The second comparator group (weighted at 40% in the award computation) 
will include a broader group of companies comprising the S&P 500.  Comparison 
against this group will be based on the TSR percentile ranking of the Company 
among the S&P 500, at the end of each Performance Period.


VI.       AWARD DETERMINATION

     After calculation of the Company's TSR ranking within the utility industry 
comparator group and the S&P 500, the schedule below will prescribe the percent 
of the Director's Performance Award Opportunity actually earned.  The 
Performance Award Opportunity shall be as specified in Section III above.

<PAGE>
     Straight line interpolation will be used for TSR Percentile Ranking 
results between those discrete values specified in the table (no interpolation 
is necessary regarding the Industry TSR Ranking).

     Final awards will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Compensation 
Committee.  Each Director's award amount will be the product obtained by 
multiplying the Director's Performance Award Opportunity shares as determined 
at the beginning of the Performance Period by the appropriate weighted 
percentages. 


VII.      EXAMPLE CALCULATION OF AWARDS
     
     The Director's Performance Award Opportunity is 600 shares at the 
beginning of the Performance Period.  Assume that at the end of the four-year 
Performance Period, the Company ranks fifth in its Industry TSR Ranking and is 
at the 75th percentile among the S&P 500 comparator group. The award would be 
computed as follows:

     Opportunity    Industry       S&P 500            Final
        Shares      Ranking        Ranking        SharesAwarded
     -----------    --------       -------        -------------

          600    x    (24%    +      28%)            =  312

VIII.     PAYMENT OPTIONS

     As soon as practicable following the end of the last year of the 
Performance Period and upon approval of the Executive Compensation Committee, 
awards will be paid totally in stock or in a combination of stock and cash (up 
to a maximum of fifty percent cash) at the election of the Director.  At the 
time awards are determined and approved, a Director may elect on a form 
provided by the Company to receive payment of up to fifty percent of the 
approved award in cash.

IX.       PRORATION OF AWARDS FOR INCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE PERIODS

     Awards will be prorated for any Performance Period that a Director did not 
serve during the full four year period, due to joining the board or retiring 
from the board during a performance period(s).  The Director's performance 
award will be calculated as provided in Section VI above, after the end of 
the last year of service (as if it 

                                   4

<PAGE>
were a full four-year Performance Period).  The award will then be multiplied 
by a prorated adjustment factor, the numerator of which is the number of months 
the Director served as a Director during the Performance Period rounded up to 
whole months and the denominator of which is 48.  The result thus obtained will 
be the actual award to be provided by the Company to a Director or his/her 
beneficiary or estate if no beneficiary is named. Notwithstanding any 
provisions in this Plan to the contrary, any payment to any beneficiary may be 
withheld until it is determined if any generation-skipping tax is due.  Any 
amounts necessary to pay such tax may be subtracted from any benefits otherwise 
due.


X.        ADMINISTRATION

     The administration of the Plan will be under the overall responsibility of 
the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Chief 
Executive Officer will be responsible for administering the Plan (computing 
awards, measuring performance of the comparator group, etc.).  Any revisions to 
the Plan will require review by the Executive Compensation Committee and 
approval of the Board of Directors.  The Chief Executive Officer will involve 
other individuals and departments as required for the full and complete 
administration of the Plan, in accordance with its terms.


XI.       NON-TRANSFERABILITY

     In no event shall the Company make any payment under the Plan to any 
assignee or creditor of a Director or of a Director's beneficiary.  Prior to 
the time of payment hereunder, a Director or beneficiary shall have no rights 
by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any 
interest under the Plan nor shall such rights be assigned or transferred by 
operation of law.


XII.      CLAIMS PROCEDURE

     A)   Filing a Claim
          --------------

     Any Director or beneficiary, or his/her authorized representative, may 
make a claim for benefits due under the Plan by making a written request 
therefor to the Executive Compensation 

                                   5

<PAGE>
Committee, setting forth with specificity the facts and events which give rise 
to the claim.

     b)   Denial of Claim
          ---------------

     The Executive Compensation Committee shall notify in writing any Director 
or beneficiary whose claim for benefits hereunder is denied.  Said notice shall 
be furnished within ninety days after the Executive Compensation Committee 
receives the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time 
for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time for processing is 
required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Director or 
beneficiary prior to the termination of the initial ninety-day period.  In no 
event shall such extension exceed a period of ninety days from the end of such 
initial period.  The notice of extension shall indicate the special 
circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the 
Executive Compensation Committee expects to render the final decision.  The 
notice of claim denial shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial, 
including specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions.  If appropriate, 
said notice shall set forth any additional information the Director or 
beneficiary needs to supply in order to perfect his/her claim.  The notice 
shall also inform the Director or beneficiary of the review procedure available 
pursuant to this Section, and of his/her right to inspect pertinent documents.

     c)   Review Of Claim Denial
          ----------------------

     A Director or beneficiary who desires further consideration of his/her 
position, or a duly authorized representative, shall, within sixty days of 
receipt of the notice above referred to, make written request to the Executive 
Compensation Committee for review of such denial. Such request shall include a 
statement of the Director's or beneficiary's position.  The Executive 
Compensation Committee shall make a full and fair review of the decision 
denying the claim, and shall deliver to the Director or beneficiary a written 
statement setting forth its decision and the specific reasons therefor, 
including specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions, within sixty days 
after receiving the request for review (unless special circumstances require an 
extension of time for processing, in which case written notice of the extension 
shall be furnished to the Director or beneficiary prior to the commencement of 
the extension and a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not 
later than 120 days after receiving the request for review).

                                   6

under the Plan, any federal, state or local taxes or other charges required by 
law to be withheld with respect to such payments.


XV.       AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     This Plan maybe amended, modified, terminated or partially terminated at 
any time by action of the Board of Directors. No amendment or termination may 
divest a Director of amounts accrued or credited to the Director at the time of 
such amendment.

the State of Minnesota.  The invalidity of any portion of the Plan shall not 
invalidate the remainder hereof and said remainder shall continue in full 
force. The captions and other titles herein are designed for convenience only 
and are not to be resorted to for the purpose of interpreting any provision of 
the Plan.


XVII.     NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS

heirs, personal representatives and beneficiaries, and 

                                   7

<PAGE>
subject to the rights granted to amend or terminate the Plan, the provisions of 
the Plan shall also be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns.

XIX.      CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

     It is intended that the Company is under a contractual obligation to make 
payments to Directors or their beneficiaries from the general funds and assets

I.        INTRODUCTION

          This amended and restated Minnesota Power & Light Company (Company) 
          Annual Incentive Plan (Plan) for a select group of Electric Utility 
          Operations (EUO) management employees is made effective as of 
          January 1, 1995.  This Plan supersedes and replaces the Minnesota 
          Power and Affiliated Company Amended and Restated Incentive 
          Compensation Plan dated January 1, 1994.

II.       PLAN PURPOSES

     .    Provide a meaningful and competitive incentive opportunity geared to 
          the achievement of specified internal and external corporate, 
          business unit, and strategic goals.

     .    Vary performance criteria/goals and incentive award amounts to 
          reflect differences in business unit and individual participant 
          challenges and accomplishments.

III.      CONCEPT

          An annual incentive plan for key management employees where the 
          award opportunity is set at the beginning of each year.  Actual 
          payments are based on the achievement of corporate (both internal 
          and external), business unit, and strategic goals.

IV.       PARTICIPATION

          Participation will be limited to those Key individuals whose actions 
          can have a substantial impact on Minnesota Power's success.  This 
          group will consist of the officer group, directors, and management 
          employees in salary grades I and above.

V.        INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES

          A threshold, target, and maximum award opportunity will be 
          established for each salary range grouping.  The "target" award will 
          be earned for achievement of above average performance (60th 
          percentile) as compared to the specified peer groups and for 
          achievement of budgeted performance of the electric utility group. 
          "Threshold" and "maximum" performance award levels then will be 
          developed in relation to the target performance award levels.

                                   2

<PAGE>
          The following table states the base award opportunity, as a percent 
          of base salary, for each management group and is exclusive of the 
          strategic award opportunity available for participants in salary 
          grades VIII and above.  Actual participant awards can vary from 0 to 
          120 percent of the base award opportunity depending upon actual 
          corporate and business unit performance.

</TABLE>
          The Chief Executive Officer will suggest, and the Compensation 
          Committee will determine, the treatment of "extraordinary" gains or 
          losses and their impact on earnings per share (EPS) and operating 
          income in the Plan.  Where possible, this determination will be made 
          prior to establishing the annual targets for EPS and operating 
          income.

VI.       PERFORMANCE APPORTIONMENT

          Performance will be assessed at two levels - corporate and business 
          unit.  Corporate performance will be divided into internal and 
          external measures.  The Chief Executive Officer will recommend, and 
          the Compensation Committee will approve, the weighting of incentive 
          opportunity.  This apportionment will be determined by salary grade 
          and will be the same for each participant within that salary grade.  
          A participant's total incentive award will be equal to the sum of 
          the amounts earned from each portion of the incentive opportunity.  
          The weighting is illustrated below.

</TABLE>

VII.      INTERNAL CORPORATE PERFORMANCE

          Internal corporate performance will be measured based on earnings 
          per share (EPS).  At the beginning of each plan year, a "target" EPS 
          goal will be established for the Company.  "Threshold" and "maximum" 
          performance levels, for incentive award determination purposes, will 
          be set up in relation to this performance target.

          EPS for the plan year must equal or exceed the "threshold" level of 
          performance before any incentive award is earned from this 
          performance measure.  The "maximum" performance level, when 
          achieved, will produce the maximum incentive award opportunity 
          achievable from the EPS portion, as illustrated below.

          Straight line interpolation will be used for determining results 
          between those specified in the table.


VIII.     EXTERNAL CORPORATE PERFORMANCE

          External corporate performance will be based upon Minnesota Power's 
          total shareholder return (TSR), as measured against both a 
          diversified electric utility peer group consisting of the ten 
          companies identified in Appendix B (60% weighting) and the S&P 500 
          (40% 

                                   4

<PAGE>
          weighting).  TSR is defined in Appendix B.  Minnesota Power's TSR 
          performance will be determined relative to the two peer groups based 
          on a ranking illustrated in the following table.

                              (60% weighting)

          Straight-line interpolation will be used for determining results 
          between those specified in the table.  No payouts will be made if 
          TSR performance is below the 40th percentile in the S&P 500 and TSR 
          performance is less than that of 4 companies in the utility peer 
          group.


IX.       BUSINESS UNIT PERFORMANCE

          Business unit goals will be based equally upon internal operating 
          income and annual percentage change in cost/kwh measured against the 
          electric utility peer group identified in Appendix B.  At the 
          beginning of each plan year, a target operating income goal will be 
          established.  Threshold and maximum performance levels also will be 
          determined.  A matrix will then be established to define award 
          opportunities based on various levels of achievement as illustrated 
          in the following table.

          Straight-line interpolation will be used for determining results 
          between those specified in the table.  No payouts will be made if 
          performance is below threshold and performance is less than that of 
          4 companies in the utility peer group.


X.        STRATEGIC AWARD

          The purpose of including a strategic award opportunity is to 
          recognize individual performance and to reward those contributions 
          that may not be adequately reflected by financial measures.  The 
          strategic award will be available to participants in salary grade 
          VIII and above only and will consist of an additional opportunity of 
          up to 10 percent of  base salary at the end of the Plan year in 
          which the award is earned.

          At the beginning of the plan year, the specific strategic goals will 
          be set forth by the Chief Executive Officer.  Following year end, 
          the Chief Executive Officer, with the approval of the Compensation 
          Committee, shall determine the extent to which the strategic goals 
          have been accomplished.

XI.       FINAL AWARD DETERMINATION

          See Appendix A for an illustrative award calculation.

                                   6

<PAGE>
XII.      FORM AND TIMING OF PAYMENT

          Cash awards will be paid as soon as practical following approval of 
          award amounts by the Compensation Committee.  No portion of the 
          award shall be paid in employer stock.

XIII.     AWARD DEFERRAL

          Each participant may elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of 
          his or her earned award.  The election must be made prior to the 
          beginning of the year in which the award is earned.  The terms 
          related to such deferrals will correspond to those provisions 
          specified in Appendix C.

XIV.      TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO RETIREMENT, DEATH, OR DISABILITY

          If a participant's employment is terminated due to retirement, 
          death, or active employment is terminated due to disability during a 
          plan year, the award earned shall be prorated based on the number of 
          months of participation within the plan year and be based upon 
          performance determined at year end.

XV.       TERMINATION FOR ANY OTHER REASON

          Termination of employment for reasons other than retirement, death, 
          or disability before the end of a plan year will result in
          forfeiture of any associated award opportunity.  However, the Chief 
          Executive Officer, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, 
          may waive such forfeiture provision.

XVI.      TAX TREATMENT

          Award payments are taxable to the participant in the year of 
          receipt.

XVII.     WITHHOLDING TAXES

          The Company will have the right to deduct any Federal, state, or 
          local taxes required by law to be withheld.

XVIII.    BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

          A participant may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any 
          benefit under this Plan is to be paid in the event of death.

                                   7

<PAGE>
XIX.      EFFECT ON EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

          Payments from this Plan shall not be included in calculating the 
          amount of employee benefits to be paid under the terms of any of the 
          Company's qualified employee benefit plans.  Payments will be 
          included for calculating benefits under the Supplemental Executive 
          Retirement Plan (SERP).

XX.       PARTICIPANT RIGHTS

          Participation in this Plan shall not interfere with the Company's 
          right to terminate any participant's employment at any time.  Rights 
          or interests of any participants in this Plan are nontransferable.

XXI.      PLAN ADMINISTRATION

          The Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will 
          have responsibility for administration of the Plan in accordance 
          with the provisions of the Plan, as specified in this Plan document 
          and these administrative plan specifications.

XXII.     PLAN AMENDMENTS

          The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify, 
          amend, suspend, or terminate, in whole or in part, any or all of the 
          provisions of the Plan.  However, no modification, amendment, 
          suspension, or termination may adversely affect a payment or 
          distribution accrued or credited to a participant. 

XXIII.    BINDING AGREEMENT

          The provisions of the Plan shall be binding upon the Participant, 
          his or her heirs, personal representatives and beneficiaries, and 
          subject to the rights granted to amend or terminate the Plan, the 
          provisions of the Plan shall also be binding upon the Company, its 
          successors and assigns.

XXIV.     CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

          It is intended that the Company is under a contractual obligation to 
          make payments to Participants or their beneficiaries from the 
          general funds and assets of the Company in accordance with the terms 
          and conditions of the Plan.  A Participant or his/her beneficiary 
          shall have no 

                                   8

<PAGE>
          rights to such payments, other than as a general, unsecured creditor 
          of the Company.

          This Minnesota Power Electric Utility Operations Annual Incentive 
Plan has been approved, and is effective, as of January 1, 1995.

Appendix B - Definition of Plan Measurements


The diversified electric utility peer group used to compare TSR (60% weighting) 
in the external corporate performance measure and to compare annual percentage 
change in cost/kwh in the business unit performance measure is:

IES Industries, Inc.
Interstate Power Company
Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric
Madison Gas & Electric Company
Midwest Resources
Northern States Power Company
Otter Tail Power Company
Wisconsin Energy Corporation
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation
WPL Holdings, Inc.

Performance Measures Definition


.    TSR is defined as:

       TSR = Stock price appreciation + reinvested dividends
             -----------------------------------------------
                         Initial stock price

The TSR is determined by means of combining the change in stock price over the 
plan year with dividends which are assumed to be reinvested on each dividend 
date.

-    Stock prices for the beginning and end of the one-year period are the 
     closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day of 
     the period (last business day prior to the start of the period for the 
     beginning prices).

-    Dividends are assumed to be reinvested on the ex-dividend date at the 
     closing stock prices on that date.

-    Calculation of TSR for the S&P 500 group is based on the companies
     included in the S&P 500 Index as of the end of the period.

.    Annual percentage change in cost/kwh is defined as:

     The dollar amount of O&M expense (adjusted as discussed below)
              incurred by the Company for each kwh sold

This performance measure reflects the change in operating and maintenance 
expenses incurred by the Company expressed in cents per kwh.  O&M expenses 
exclude fuel, P&I power, taxes, and 

                                   B-1

<PAGE>
Appendix B - Definition of Plan Measurements

depreciation, but include an amount equal to the O&M component (the current 
MAPP rate) of net purchased and interchanged power.

Cost/kwh =          O&M expenses, as defined above
               +     (___ mills x net purchased
                     and interchanged power in)
                    ---------------------------
                         Total kwh sales

     Performance based on this measure is calculated on an annual percentage 
     rate of change.  The lowest percentage change rate, when compared to other 
     companies in the group, indicates the best performance.

In computing these performance measures, the most recent data published by each 
utility in the comparator group applicable to the plan year will be used for 
purposes of determining results.  If the most recent data are different data 
from data used previously (due to restatement, etc), the latest data will be 
used for the current plan year in determining such year's awards, but no 
retroactive adjustments will be made relative to awards made previously.

                                   B-2

<PAGE>
Appendix C - Payment/Deferral Options


     Except as hereinafter specifically provided, participants will be given 
the following options to receive their award: 

     a)   current payment of all or a portion of the award 

     b)   payment deferred to a date specified by the participant (at which 
time such award shall be paid in full), with the latest deferral date to be the 
earlier of (i) six months after the participant's seventieth birthday or (ii) 
such date selected by the participant up to five years after the date of the 
participant's retirement; or

     c)   payment deferred to the earlier to occur of the following events:

          (i)   The retirement of the participant or, if elected up to five 
     years after retirement, but in no event later than age 70 1/2 (in which 
     case the participant may also elect to receive the award in equal monthly 
     installments commencing on the first day of the month following the date 
     of the participant's retirement or anniversary thereof if so elected, and 
     continuing thereafter for a period of fifteen (15), ten (10) or five (5) 
     years, as is elected by the participant).

          (ii)  the death of the participant,

          (iii) the termination of the participant's employment.

     The foregoing Elections must be made in writing to the Executive 
Compensation Committee prior to the end of the calendar year preceding the year 
in which the award is earned.  Such election shall be irrevocable.

     Participants who elect to receive their awards currently will be paid the 
amount of their awards plus interest from January 1 following the Plan year to 
the payment date, at the rate of 8 percent per annum.

     Participants who elect to defer their awards will have the following three 
options available under which their awards can be deferred (with the 
irrevocable election of an option being made contemporaneously with the 
election to defer):

          a)   Deferral in accordance with the participant's commitment under 
     the Company's Executive Investment Plan I or Executive Investment Plan II. 
     Amounts will be credited to the participant's account under such Plan(s) 
     effective January 1 following the Plan year.

                                   C-1

<PAGE>
          b)   Deferral with interest paid on all amounts deferred effective 
     January 1 following the Plan year at a fixed rate of 8 percent per annum.

          c)   Deferral with interest paid on all amounts deferred effective 
     January 1 following the Plan year to the award payment date at the rate of 
     8 percent per annum and thereafter for the deferral period on all amounts 
     at a rate equivalent to the overall percentage return achieved as if the 
     deferred amounts had been invested in any of the following Mutual Funds, 
     which shall serve as a performance reference only:

            (i)     Nicholas Fund, Inc. 

           (ii)     Fidelity Magellan Fund (Amounts deferred into this Fund 
                    are subject to a 3% upfront sales charge)

          (iii)     Investment Advisors Incorporated (IAI) Emerging Growth 
                    Fund

           (iv)     Investment Advisors Incorporated (IAI) International 
                    Developed Market Fund

            (v)     Fidelity Balanced Fund

           (vi)     Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio

          (vii)     Templeton International Emerging Market

     Participants who choose deferral under either b) or c) above are permitted 
annually to continue the accrual of interest on deferred awards using the 
interest rate alternative chosen one year earlier, or to switch to an alternate 
method of computing interest on all deferred awards during the succeeding year. 
This does not in any way affect the period of the deferral chosen by the 
participant.  

     If payments to a participant are to be made in installments, then the 
unpaid amounts due to the participant shall continue to be credited based on 
the participant's annual elections.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a participant dies 
while employed by the Company, or if a participant who has terminated 
employment dies before receiving all payments which such participant is 
entitled to receive pursuant to an election hereunder, the amount then standing 
to the credit of such participant under this Plan shall be paid in a single sum 
within the first 30 days of the calendar year following the date of the 
participant's death to the participant's beneficiary.

                                   C-2

<PAGE>
     In the event of a participant's financial hardship or unforeseen financial 
emergency, the Executive Compensation Committee, in its sole and absolute 
discretion may alter the timing or manner of payment of any benefits or 
deferred amounts to be paid pursuant to the Plan, (provided, however, any such 
alteration shall only occur with respect to these amounts reasonably required 
to alleviate the participant's financial hardship or unforeseen emergency).  
Financial hardship shall be deemed to have occurred in the event of the 
participant's impending bankruptcy, a participant's or defendant's long and 
serious illness or other events of similar magnitude.  An unforeseeable 
financial emergency shall mean an unexpected need for cash arising from 
illness, casualty loss, sudden financial reversal or other such unforeseeable 
occurrence.  Normal expenditures for the vocational or college education of a 
dependent, the purchase of a house or any similar expense, shall not be 
considered a financial hardship or an unforeseeable financial emergency.  The 
Benefit Plans Committee's decision in passing upon the financial hardship or 
unforeseeable financial emergency of the participant, and the manner in which, 
if at all, the payment of any amounts pursuant to the Plan shall be altered or 
modified, shall be final, conclusive and not subject to appeal.  The 
participant, the participant's spouse, if any, and the participant's 
beneficiary waive all claims against the Benefit Plans Committee for 
determinations made by the Benefit Plans Committee under this Section, and the 
participant shall have no claim or right to make up any amount distributed or 
transferred as a result of a determination of financial hardship or 
unforeseeable financial emergency by the Benefit Plans Committee pursuant to 
this Section.  Any participant for whom the Benefit Plans Committee grants 
relief under this Section may not re-enter the Plan, or make any deferral of 
compensation under the Plan, until the Plan Year following the second 
anniversary of the date on which such relief is granted to such participant.

     If a participant's employment with the Company terminates for any reason 
other than retirement, death or disability, the balance then standing to the 
credit of such participant under this Plan, as of the end of the month 
immediately preceding or coincident with the date of termination of employment, 
shall be paid to the participant in a single sum upon the date of  separation 
from service, or within 30 days thereafter.  If a participant entitled to a 
benefit under this paragraph dies prior to receiving payment, then such payment 
shall be made to the participant's beneficiary.

     In years where deferred compensation elections are made available under 
Executive Investment Plans I & II, each participant shall be entitled to 
transfer unpaid awards under this plan as a Rollover Amount to the Minnesota 
Power and Affiliated Companies Executive Investment Plan I or the Minnesota 
Power and Affiliated Companies Executive Investment Plan II, all subject to the 
specific terms and restrictions in said Plans.  Provided, however, the transfer 
of an unpaid award as a Rollover Amount shall not result in a deferral or 
acceleration of the date 

                                   C-3

<PAGE>
or dates on which such Rollover Amount would have been received had no transfer 
occurred.

     "Retire" and "retirement" as used in this Plan shall mean a termination of 
employment after attaining "Early Retirement Age" as defined in the 
Supplemental Retirement Plan.

     The administration of the Annual Incentive Plan will be under the overall 
responsibility of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of 
Directors.  The Chief Executive Officer will be responsible for administering 
the Plan on a routine basis (computing awards, measuring performance of the 
comparator group, etc).  Any revisions to the Plan will require review by the 
Executive Compensation Committee and approval of the Board of Directors.  The 
Chief Executive Officer will involve those other individuals and departments as 
required in the full and complete administration of the Plan, in accordance 
with its terms.

     In administering the Plan, the Executive Compensation Committee will apply 
uniform rules to all participants similarly situated.  If any claim for 
benefits under the Plan is wholly or partially denied, the claimant shall be 
given notice in writing, within a reasonable period of time after receipt of 
the claim by the Plan, by registered or certified mail, of such denial, written 
in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, setting forth the 
specific reasons for such denial, specific reference to pertinent Plan 
provisions on which the denial is based, a description of any additional 
material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an 
explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and an 
explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.  The claimant also shall be 
advised that the claimant's duly authorized representative may request a 
review, by the Executive Compensation Committee, of the decision denying the 
claim by filing with the Executive Compensation Committee, within 65 days after 
such notice has been received by the claimant, a written request for such 
review, and that the claimant's duly authorized representative may review 
pertinent documents, and submit issues and comments in writing within the same 
65-day period.  If such request is so filed, such review shall be made by the 
Executive Compensation Committee within 60 days after receipt of such request; 
and the claimant shall be given written notice of the decision resulting from 
such review, and shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a 
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, and specific references to 
the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.

     The Executive Compensation Committee may make payment to any participant 
or any beneficiary of a participant, of any benefits or deferred amounts to be 
paid under the Plan, in advance of the date when otherwise due, if, based on a 
change in federal tax law or regulation, published rulings or similar 
announcements by the Internal Revenue Service, decision by a court of competent 
jurisdiction involving the Plan,

                                   C-4

<PAGE>
or a closing agreement made under Section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 that involves the Plan, it determines that a participant or beneficiary 
will recognize income for federal income tax purposes with respect to amounts 
that are otherwise not then payable under the Plan.  The Executive Compensation 
Committee may also make such payments to any participant, or beneficiary of a 
participant, in advance of the date when otherwise due, if it shall be 
determined that the Plan is subject to the requirements of Parts 2 and 3 of 
Subtitle B of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
because such Plan is not maintained primarily for the purpose of providing 
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated 
employees.

     All payments to be made by the Company under the Plan shall be made to the 
participant, if living.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event of a 
participant's death prior to the receipt of all payments hereunder, all 
subsequent payments to be made under the Plan shall be made to the beneficiary 
designated by the participant, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
participant's beneficiary designation, in the event a beneficiary dies before 
receiving all payments due to such beneficiary pursuant to this Plan, the then 
remaining payments shall be paid to the legal representatives of the 
beneficiary's estate.  The participant shall designate a beneficiary, or during 
the participant's lifetime change such designation, by filing a written notice 
of such designation with the Company in such form and subject to such rules and 
regulations as the Executive Compensation Committee may prescribe.  If the 
participant's payments constitute community property, then any beneficiary 
designation made by the participant other than a designation of such 
participant's spouse shall not be effective if any such beneficiary or 
beneficiaries are to receive more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate 
benefits payable hereunder, unless such spouse shall approve such designation 
in writing.  If no beneficiary designation shall be in effect at the time when 
any benefits payable under this Plan shall become due, the benefit payments 
shall be made to the legal representative of the participant's estate.

     Notwithstanding any provisions in this Plan to the contrary, the Executive 
Compensation Committee may withhold any benefits payable to a beneficiary as a 
result of the death of the participant (or the death of any beneficiary 
designated by the participant) until such time as (i) the Committee is able to 
determine whether a generation-skipping transfer tax, as defined in Chapter 13 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any substitute provision therefor, is 
payable by the Company; and (ii) the Committee has determined the amount of 
generation-skipping transfer tax that is due, including interest thereon. If 
any such tax is payable, the Executive Compensation Committee shall reduce the 
benefits otherwise payable hereunder to such beneficiary by an amount equal to 
the generation-skipping transfer tax and any interest thereon that is payable 
as a result of the death in question.

                                   C-5

<PAGE>
     Benefits payable under the Plan are not in any way subject to the debts or 
other obligations of the persons entitled to those payments, whether the person 
is a participant or a beneficiary.  Benefits under the Plan may not voluntarily 
or involuntarily be sold, transferred, or assigned.

I.        INTRODUCTION

          This amended and restated Minnesota Power & Light Company (Company) 
          Annual Incentive Plan (Plan) for a select group of management 
          employees is made effective as of January 1, 1995.  This Plan 
          supersedes and replaces the Minnesota Power and Affiliated Company 
          Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan dated January 1, 
          1994.

II.       PLAN PURPOSES

     .    Provide a meaningful and competitive incentive opportunity geared to 
          the achievement of specified internal and external corporate, 
          business unit, and strategic goals.

     .    Vary performance criteria/goals and incentive award amounts to 
          reflect differences in business unit and individual participant 
          challenges and accomplishments.

III.      CONCEPT

          An annual incentive plan for key management employees where the 
          award opportunity is set at the beginning of each year.  Actual 
          payments are based on the achievement of corporate (both internal 
          and external), business unit, and strategic goals.

IV.       PARTICIPATION

          Participation will be limited to those Key individuals whose actions 
          can have a substantial impact on Minnesota Power's success.  This 
          group will consist of the officer group, directors, and management 
          employees in salary grades I and above.

V.        INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES

          A threshold, target, and maximum award opportunity will be 
          established for each salary range grouping.  The "target" award will 
          be earned for achievement of above average performance (60th 
          percentile) as compared to the specified peer groups and for 
          achievement of budgeted performance of the electric utility group.  
          "Threshold" and "maximum" performance award levels then will be 
          developed in relation to the target performance award levels.

                                   2
<PAGE>
          The following table states the base award opportunity, as a percent 
          of base salary, for each management group and is exclusive of the 
          strategic award opportunity available for participants in salary 
          grades VIII and above.  Actual participant awards can vary from 0 to 
          120 percent of the base award opportunity depending upon actual 
          corporate and business unit performance.

          VI-VII                             30%
          IV-V                               25%

</TABLE>

          The Chief Executive Officer will suggest, and the Compensation 
          Committee will determine, the treatment of "extraordinary" gains or 
          losses and their impact on earnings per share (EPS) and operating 
          income in the Plan.  Where possible, this determination will be made 
          prior to establishing the annual targets for EPS and operating 
          income.

VI.       PERFORMANCE APPORTIONMENT

          Performance will be assessed at two levels - corporate and business 
          unit.  Corporate performance will be divided into internal and 
          external measures.  The Chief Executive Officer will recommend, and 
          the Compensation Committee will approve, the weighting of incentive 
          opportunity.  This apportionment will be determined by salary grade 
          and will be the same for each participant within that salary grade. 
          A participant's total incentive award will be equal to the sum of 
          the amounts earned from each portion of the incentive opportunity.  
          The weighting is illustrated below.

          *Those participants in the corporate development area will have 
          individual acquisition-oriented goals, rather than business unit 
          goals relating to EUO and SSU.
          ---------------------------------------------------------------

VII.      INTERNAL CORPORATE PERFORMANCE

          Internal corporate performance will be measured based on earnings 
          per share (EPS).  At the beginning of each plan year, a "target" EPS 
          goal will be established for the Company.  "Threshold" and "maximum" 
          performance levels, for incentive award determination purposes, will 
          be set up in relation to this performance target.

          EPS for the plan year must equal or exceed the "threshold" level of 
          performance before any incentive award is earned from this 
          performance measure. The "maximum" performance level, when achieved, 
          will produce the maximum incentive award opportunity achievable from 
          the EPS portion, as illustrated below.

<PAGE>
VIII.          EXTERNAL CORPORATE PERFORMANCE

          External corporate performance will be based upon Minnesota Power's 
          total shareholder return (TSR), as measured against both a 
          diversified electric utility peer group consisting of the ten 
          companies identified in Appendix B (60% weighting) and the S&P 500 
          (40% weighting).  TSR is defined in Appendix B.  Minnesota Power's 
          TSR performance will be determined relative to the two peer groups 
          based on a ranking  illustrated in the following table.

                                   (60% weighting)

          Straight-line interpolation will be used for determining results 
          between those specified in the table.  No payouts will be made if 
          TSR performance is below the 40th percentile in the S&P 500 and TSR 
          performance is less than that of 4 companies in the utility peer 
          group.


IX.       BUSINESS UNIT/CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT

          Business unit goals will be based one-third on operating income for 
          the water resource operations group and two-thirds on operating 
          income for the electric utility operations group.  For those 
          participants in the corporate development area, business unit 
          performance goals will 

                                   5

<PAGE>
          instead be acquisition-oriented goals related to the participants' 
          area of responsibility. 

               A matrix has been established to determine award opportunities 
          based on various levels of achievement for the electric utility and 
          water resource operations groups, as illustrated in the following 
          table.

          Straight-line interpolation will be used for determining results 
          between those specified in the table.  No payouts will be made for 
          performance below threshold in each performance measure.


X.        STRATEGIC AWARD

          The purpose of including a strategic award is to recognize 
          individual performance and to reward those contributions that may 
          not be adequately reflected by financial measures.  The strategic 
          award will be available to participants in salary grade VIII and 
          above only and will consist of an additional opportunity of up to 10 
          percent of base salary for participants in salary grades VIII-IX and 
          15 percent of base salary for participants in salary grade XI.  Base 
          salary in place at the end of the Plan year in which the award is 
          earned will be used to calculate the strategic award.

          At the beginning of the plan year, the specific strategic goals will 
          be set forth by the Chief Executive Officer (and by the Compensation 
          Committee for the Chief Executive Officer).  Following year end, the 
          Chief Executive Officer, with the approval of the Compensation 
          Committee, shall determine the extent to which the strategic goals 
          have 

                                   6

<PAGE>
          been accomplished.  The Compensation Committee shall make this 
          determination for the Chief Executive Officer.

XI.       AWARD DETERMINATION

          See Appendix A for an illustrative award calculation.

XII.      FORM AND TIMING OF PAYMENT

          Cash awards will be paid as soon as practical following approval of 
          award amounts by the Compensation Committee.  No portion of the 
          award shall be paid in employer stock.

XIII.     AWARD DEFERRAL

          Each participant may elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of 
          his or her earned award.  The election must be made prior to the 
          beginning of the year in which the award is earned.  The terms 
          related to such deferrals will correspond to those provisions 
          specified in Appendix C.

XIV.      TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO RETIREMENT, DEATH, OR DISABILITY

          If a participant's employment is terminated due to retirement, 
          death, or active employment is terminated due to disability during a 
          plan year, the award earned shall be prorated based on the number of 
          months of participation within the plan year and be based upon 
          performance determined at year end.

XV.       TERMINATION FOR ANY OTHER REASON

          Termination of employment for reasons other than retirement, death, 
          or disability before the end of a plan year will result in 
          forfeiture of any associated award opportunity.  However, the Chief 
          Executive Officer, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, 
          may waive such forfeiture provision.

XVI.      TAX TREATMENT

          Award payments are taxable to the participant in the year of 
          receipt.

XVII.     WITHHOLDING TAXES

          The Company will have the right to deduct any Federal, state, or 
          local taxes required by law to be withheld.

XVIII.    BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

          A participant may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any 
          benefit under this Plan is to be paid in the event of death.

XIX.      EFFECT ON EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

          Payments from this Plan shall not be included in calculating the 
          amount of employee benefits to be paid under the terms of any of the 
          Company's qualified employee benefit plans.  Payments will be 
          included for calculating benefits under the Supplemental Executive 
          Retirement Plan (SERP).

XX.       PARTICIPANT RIGHTS

          Participation in this Plan shall not interfere with the Company's 
          right to terminate any participant's employment at any time.  Rights 
          or interests of any participants in this Plan are nontransferable.

XXI.      PLAN ADMINISTRATION

          The Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will 
          have responsibility for administration of the Plan in accordance 
          with the provisions of the Plan, as specified in this Plan document 
          and these administrative plan specifications.

XXII.     PLAN AMENDMENTS

          The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify, 
          amend, suspend, or terminate, in whole or in part, any or all of the 
          provisions of the Plan.  However, no modification, amendment, 
          suspension, or termination may adversely affect a payment or 
          distribution accrued or credited to a participant.

                                   8

<PAGE>
XXIII.    BINDING AGREEMENT

          The provisions of the Plan shall be binding upon the Participant, 
          his or her heirs, personal representatives and beneficiaries, and 
          subject to the rights granted to amend or terminate the Plan, the 
          provisions of the Plan shall also be binding upon the Company, its 
          successors and assigns.

XXIV.     CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

          It is intended that the Company is under a contractual obligation to 
          make payments to Participants or their beneficiaries from the 
          general funds and assets of the Company in accordance with the terms 
          and conditions of the Plan.  A Participant or his/her beneficiary 
          shall have no rights to such payments, other than as a general, 
          unsecured creditor of the Company.

          This Minnesota Power Corporate Annual Incentive Plan has been 
          approved, and is effective, as of January 1, 1995.

Appendix B - Definition of Plan Measurements


The diversified electric utility peer group used to compare TSR (60% weighting) 
in the external corporate performance measure and to compare annual percentage 
change in cost/kwh in the business unit performance measure is:

IES Industries, Inc.
Interstate Power Company
Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric
Madison Gas & Electric Company
Midwest Resources
Northern States Power Company
Otter Tail Power Company
Wisconsin Energy Corporation
WPL Holdings, Inc.

Performance Measures Definition


.    TSR is defined as:

     TSR = Stock price appreciation + reinvested dividends
           -----------------------------------------------
                       Initial stock price

The TSR is determined by means of combining the change in stock price over the 
plan year with dividends which are assumed to be reinvested on each dividend 
date.

-    Stock prices for the beginning and end of the one-year period are the 
     closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day of 
     the period (last business day prior to the start of the period for the 
     beginning prices).

-    Dividends are assumed to be reinvested on the ex-dividend date at the 
     closing stock prices on that date.

-    Calculation of TSR for the S&P 500 group is based on the companies 
     included in the S&P 500 Index as of the end of the period.

Appendix C - Payment/Deferral Options

     Except as hereinafter specifically provided, participants will be given 
the following options to receive their award: 

     a)   current payment of all or a portion of the award 

     b)   payment deferred to a date specified by the participant (at which 
time such award shall be paid in full), with the latest deferral date to be the 
earlier of (i) six months after the participant's seventieth birthday or (ii) 
such date selected by the participant up to five years after the date of the 
participant's retirement; or

     c)   payment deferred to the earlier to occur of the following events:

          (i)   The retirement of the participant or, if elected up to five 
     years after retirement, but in no event later than age 70 1/2 (in which 
     case the participant may also elect to receive the award in equal monthly 
     installments commencing on the first day of the month following the date 
     of the participant's retirement or anniversary thereof if so elected, and 
     continuing thereafter for a period of fifteen (15), ten (10) or five (5) 
     years, as is elected by the participant).

          (ii)  the death of the participant,

          (iii) the termination of the participant's employment.

     The foregoing Elections must be made in writing to the Executive 
Compensation Committee prior to the end of the calendar year preceding the year 
in which the award is earned.  Such election shall be irrevocable.

     Participants who elect to receive their awards currently will be paid the 
amount of their awards plus interest from January 1 following the Plan year to 
the payment date, at the rate of 8 percent per annum.

     Participants who elect to defer their awards will have the following three 
options available under which their awards can be deferred (with the 
irrevocable election of an option being made contemporaneously with the 
election to defer):

          a)   Deferral in accordance with the participant's commitment under 
     the Company's Executive Investment Plan I or Executive Investment Plan II. 
     Amounts will be credited to the participant's account under such Plan(s) 
     effective January 1 following the Plan year.

                                   C-1

<PAGE>
          b)   Deferral with interest paid on all amounts deferred effective 
     January 1 following the Plan year at a fixed rate of 8 percent per annum.

          c)   Deferral with interest paid on all amounts deferred effective 
     January 1 following the Plan year to the award payment date at the rate of 
     8 percent per annum and thereafter for the deferral period on all amounts 
     at a rate equivalent to the overall percentage return achieved as if the 
     deferred amounts had been invested in any of the following Mutual Funds, 
     which shall serve as a performance reference only:

            (i)     Nicholas Fund, Inc. 

           (ii)     Fidelity Magellan Fund (Amounts deferred into this Fund 
                    are subject to a 3% upfront sales charge)

          (iii)     Investment Advisors Incorporated (IAI) Emerging Growth 
                    Fund

           (iv)     Investment Advisors Incorporated (IAI) International 
                    Developed Market Fund

            (v)     Fidelity Balanced Fund

           (vi)     Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio

          (vii)     Templeton International Emerging Market

     Participants who choose deferral under either b) or c) above are permitted 
annually to continue the accrual of interest on deferred awards using the 
interest rate alternative chosen one year earlier, or to switch to an alternate 
method of computing interest on all deferred awards during the succeeding year. 
This does not in any way affect the period of the deferral chosen by the 
participant.  

     If payments to a participant are to be made in installments, then the 
unpaid amounts due to the participant shall continue to be credited based on 
the participant's annual elections.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a participant dies 
while employed by the Company, or if a participant who has terminated 
employment dies before receiving all payments which such participant is 
entitled to receive pursuant to an election hereunder, the amount then standing 
to the credit of such participant under this Plan shall be paid in a single sum 
within the first 30 days of the calendar year following the date of the 
participant's death to the participant's beneficiary.

                                   C-2

<PAGE>
     In the event of a participant's financial hardship or unforeseen financial 
emergency, the Executive Compensation Committee, in its sole and absolute 
discretion may alter the timing or manner of payment of any benefits or 
deferred amounts to be paid pursuant to the Plan, (provided, however, any such 
alteration shall only occur with respect to these amounts reasonably required 
to alleviate the participant's financial hardship or unforeseen emergency).  
Financial hardship shall be deemed to have occurred in the event of the 
participant's impending bankruptcy, a participant's or defendant's long and 
serious illness or other events of similar magnitude.  An unforeseeable 
financial emergency shall mean an unexpected need for cash arising from 
illness, casualty loss, sudden financial reversal or other such unforeseeable 
occurrence.  Normal expenditures for the vocational or college education of a 
dependent, the purchase of a house or any similar expense, shall not be 
considered a financial hardship or an unforeseeable financial emergency.  The 
Benefit Plans Committee's decision in passing upon the financial hardship or 
unforeseeable financial emergency of the participant, and the manner in which, 
if at all, the payment of any amounts pursuant to the Plan shall be altered or 
modified, shall be final, conclusive and not subject to appeal.  The 
participant, the participant's spouse, if any, and the participant's 
beneficiary waive all claims against the Benefit Plans Committee for 
determinations made by the Benefit Plans Committee under this Section, and the 
participant shall have no claim or right to make up any amount distributed or 
transferred as a result of a determination of financial hardship or 
unforeseeable financial emergency by the Benefit Plans Committee pursuant to 
this Section.  Any participant for whom the Benefit Plans Committee grants 
relief under this Section may not re-enter the Plan, or make any deferral of 
compensation under the Plan, until the Plan Year following the second 
anniversary of the date on which such relief is granted to such participant.

     If a participant's employment with the Company terminates for any reason 
other than retirement, death or disability, the balance then standing to the 
credit of such participant under this Plan, as of the end of the month 
immediately preceding or coincident with the date of termination of employment, 
shall be paid to the participant in a single sum upon the date of  separation 
from service, or within 30 days thereafter.  If a participant entitled to a 
benefit under this paragraph dies prior to receiving payment, then such payment 
shall be made to the participant's beneficiary.

     In years where deferred compensation elections are made available under 
Executive Investment Plans I & II, each participant shall be entitled to 
transfer unpaid awards under this plan as a Rollover Amount to the Minnesota 
Power and Affiliated Companies Executive Investment Plan I or the Minnesota 
Power and Affiliated Companies Executive Investment Plan II, all subject to the 
specific terms and restrictions in said Plans.  Provided, however, the transfer 
of an unpaid award as a Rollover Amount shall not result in a deferral or 
acceleration of the date 

                                   C-3

<PAGE>
or dates on which such Rollover Amount would have been received had no transfer 
occurred.

     "Retire" and "retirement" as used in this Plan shall mean a termination of 
employment after attaining "Early Retirement Age" as defined in the 
Supplemental Retirement Plan.

     The administration of the Annual Incentive Plan will be under the overall 
responsibility of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of 
Directors.  The Chief Executive Officer will be responsible for administering 
the Plan on a routine basis (computing awards, measuring performance of the 
comparator group, etc).  Any revisions to the Plan will require review by the 
Executive Compensation Committee and approval of the Board of Directors.  The 
Chief Executive Officer will involve those other individuals and departments as 
required in the full and complete administration of the Plan, in accordance 
with its terms.

     In administering the Plan, the Executive Compensation Committee will apply 
uniform rules to all participants similarly situated.  If any claim for 
benefits under the Plan is wholly or partially denied, the claimant shall be 
given notice in writing, within a reasonable period of time after receipt of 
the claim by the Plan, by registered or certified mail, of such denial, written 
in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, setting forth the 
specific reasons for such denial, specific reference to pertinent Plan 
provisions on which the denial is based, a description of any additional 
material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an 
explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and an 
explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.  The claimant also shall be 
advised that the claimant's duly authorized representative may request a 
review, by the Executive Compensation Committee, of the decision denying the 
claim by filing with the Executive Compensation Committee, within 65 days after 
such notice has been received by the claimant, a written request for such 
review, and that the claimant's duly authorized representative may review 
pertinent documents, and submit issues and comments in writing within the same 
65-day period.  If such request is so filed, such review shall be made by the 
Executive Compensation Committee within 60 days after receipt of such request; 
and the claimant shall be given written notice of the decision resulting from 
such review, and shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a 
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, and specific references to 
the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.

     The Executive Compensation Committee may make payment to any participant 
or any beneficiary of a participant, of any benefits or deferred amounts to be 
paid under the Plan, in advance of the date when otherwise due, if, based on a 
change in federal tax law or regulation, published rulings or similar 
announcements by the Internal Revenue Service, decision by a court of competent 
jurisdiction involving the Plan, 

                                   C-4

<PAGE>
or a closing agreement made under Section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 that involves the Plan, it determines that a participant or beneficiary 
will recognize income for federal income tax purposes with respect to amounts 
that are otherwise not then payable under the Plan.  The Executive Compensation 
Committee may also make such payments to any participant, or beneficiary of a 
participant, in advance of the date when otherwise due, if it shall be 
determined that the Plan is subject to the requirements of Parts 2 and 3 of 
Subtitle B of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
because such Plan is not maintained primarily for the purpose of providing 
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated 
employees.

     All payments to be made by the Company under the Plan shall be made to the 
participant, if living.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event of a 
participant's death prior to the receipt of all payments hereunder, all 
subsequent payments to be made under the Plan shall be made to the beneficiary 
designated by the participant, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
participant's beneficiary designation, in the event a beneficiary dies before 
receiving all payments due to such beneficiary pursuant to this Plan, the then 
remaining payments shall be paid to the legal representatives of the 
beneficiary's estate.  The participant shall designate a beneficiary, or during 
the participant's lifetime change such designation, by filing a written notice 
of such designation with the Company in such form and subject to such rules and 
regulations as the Executive Compensation Committee may prescribe.  If the 
participant's payments constitute community property, then any beneficiary 
designation made by the participant other than a designation of such 
participant's spouse shall not be effective if any such beneficiary or 
beneficiaries are to receive more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate 
benefits payable hereunder, unless such spouse shall approve such designation 
in writing.  If no beneficiary designation shall be in effect at the time when 
any benefits payable under this Plan shall become due, the benefit payments 
shall be made to the legal representative of the participant's estate.

     Notwithstanding any provisions in this Plan to the contrary, the Executive 
Compensation Committee may withhold any benefits payable to a beneficiary as a 
result of the death of the participant (or the death of any beneficiary 
designated by the participant) until such time as (i) the Committee is able to 
determine whether a generation-skipping transfer tax, as defined in Chapter 13 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any substitute provision therefor, is 
payable by the Company; and (ii) the Committee has determined the amount of 
generation-skipping transfer tax that is due, including interest thereon. If 
any such tax is payable, the Executive Compensation Committee shall reduce the 
benefits otherwise payable hereunder to such beneficiary by an amount equal to 
the generation-skipping transfer tax and any interest thereon that is payable 
as a result of the death in question.

                                   C-5

<PAGE>
     Benefits payable under the Plan are not in any way subject to the debts or 
other obligations of the persons entitled to those payments, whether the person 
is a participant or a beneficiary.  Benefits under the Plan may not voluntarily 
or involuntarily be sold, transferred, or assigned.

Electric Utility Operations

Minnesota Power is a diversified utility company headquartered in Duluth, Minn. 
We provide electric service to 133,000 customers in northern Minnesota and 
northwestern Wisconsin.  Large industrial customers, which account for about 
half our electric revenue, include paper mills and Minnesota's taconite 
industry, which supplies most of the pelletized iron used in U.S. steel-making. 
Wisconsin electric customers are served by our Superior Water, Light and Power 
Company subsidiary.  SWL&P also supplies water and natural gas to about 10,000 
customers in the city of Superior and nearby areas. Another subsidiary, BNI 
Coal, mines and sells lignite coal to two North Dakota mine-mouth generating 
units, one of which supplies Minnesota Power with 71% of its output under a 
long-term contract.

Water Utility Operations

Our Southern States Utilities subsidiary is the largest independent supplier of 
water and wastewater utility service in Florida, serving more than 100 
communities.  Our Heater Utilities subsidiary provides water and wastewater 
services in North Carolina and South Carolina.  SSU and Heater serve a total of 
139,000 water customers and 47,000 wastewater treatment customers. In addition, 
a subsidiary of SSU supplies sanitation service to 12,000 customers in Lehigh 
Acres, a community in southwest Florida.

Investments and Corporate Services

While electric and water utilities are our core businesses, non-regulated 
investments supplement our earnings and, in some cases, perform an economic 
development function in our electric utility service area.  These investments - 
and our ownership stake in them - include a securities portfolio that provides 
funds for reinvestment and business acquisitions (100%); Capital Re 
Corporation, a financial guaranty reinsurance company (21%); Lehigh Acquisition 
Corp., southwest Florida real estate sales (80%); Lake Superior Paper 
Industries, a Duluth paper mill (50%); and Superior Recycled Fiber Industries, 
a Duluth recycled pulp production plant (88%).

Dividends of Change

     Change has been a friend to Minnesota Power.  In the early 1980s, when we 
recognized we could no longer stake our future mainly on selling electricity to 
the iron mining industry, we began to diversify.  We invested in water 
utilities, coal mining, papermaking and other fields.

     In all our businesses, old and new, we're dedicated to continuous 
improvement.  We're adapting to a changing regulatory climate, streamlining and 
becoming more efficient in the way we work, and increasing reliance on team 
dynamics and participatory management.

     In the hands of motivated, goal-oriented men and women, change pays 
important dividends.  Some are intangible yet valuable, others have dramatic 
financial impact such as the example below.  Change has strengthened our 
company.  This report highlights 11 representative Dividends of Change.

The Rewards of 'Partnering'

Most companies have both customers and suppliers. But not all have discovered 
the economic advantage in building cooperative relationships with both groups. 
As an example of "partnering" with a supplier, we've signed a new, more 
flexible contract with our coal hauler, the Burlington Northern Railroad. It's 
based on the assumption that we'll sell more power and buy more coal if we can 
keep our costs down, benefiting our company, the BN, and our customers. Our 
combined savings on the cost of coal and rail transportation is more than $20 
million annually. Eric Norberg, left, and Dave McMillan represent the many 
people of Minnesota Power who presented our case in this landmark negotiation.

How would you assess 1994's financial and operating results?

Earnings of $2.06 per share were disappointing, a 6% decrease from the previous 
year and the lowest in a decade.  The largest single reason for the lower 
earnings was our securities portfolio.  A consistent and substantial 
contributor to our earnings for 10 years, the portfolio was hurt by lower 
market returns, declines in the value of some of its holdings, and a 21-cent-
per-share write-off of one investment early in the year.  Despite that rocky 
start, it finished the year with an after-tax return of 3.8%, but compared with 
the previous year, its income declined 55 cents per share.

Despite the lower earnings per share, 1994 also brought important, positive 
developments for Minnesota Power that should help future earnings.  Northeast 
Minnesota's taconite plants and paper mills had a good year, and this spurred 
our electric utility business to its second-highest kilowatt-hour sales ever.  
Six of our nine largest power customers extended their contracts with us.  We 
received a rate increase, the first since 1981, and our rates remain well below 
national and regional utility averages. BNI Coal broke records, and Superior 
Recycled Fiber Industries was profitable its first year out of the gate. Lake 
Superior Paper, with help from price increases, turned the corner in the fourth 
quarter and is positioned for higher profits this year.  Water utility earnings 
were hurt by abnormally high rainfall; we continue upgrading water facilities, 
improving customer service, and laying the groundwork for returns that more 
fairly reflect our investment in the water business.  Finally, we signed an 
agreement to acquire 80% ownership in ADESA Corporation, a business we believe 
will give us the growth we need to achieve our financial goals in the coming 
years.

What are the Company's financial goals?

Our goal is to increase earnings to a minimum of $3.25 per share by the year 
2000.  We expect the earnings to come, approximately one-third each, from 
electric utility operations, water utility operations, and other investments, 
the largest of which would be ADESA.  That may look like a stretch, but I'm 
confident we can do it.

Minnesota Power's stock price has dropped roughly 30% from the highs it hit in 
autumn 1993.  Why?

The rising interest rates of the last year and a half have hurt most utility 
stocks and probably account for much of our price decline. Beyond that, three 
things happened. One was the National Steel taconite plant shutdown in late 
1993 and, although the plant restarted last August, the stock market has not 
yet given back to us the price drop that hit when the closing was announced. 
Second, our first-quarter securities portfolio loss dashed expectations for 
earnings growth in 1994. Finally, the announcement of our planned ADESA 
acquisition in January 1995 created additional uncertainty that seemed to keep 
our stock from sharing in some gains that other utility stocks enjoyed early 
this year.

What is the Company doing to improve its stock price?

In the long run, of course, the most important thing will be performance:  We 
intend to increase our earnings by providing exceptional customer service at 
competitive prices.  In the shorter term, perception is also important, and I 
think the stock price reflects some uneasiness analysts are currently feeling 
about our Company.  One problem is that diversification, which has benefited us 
significantly for the past decade, has also made us more complex to understand. 
That's where communication can help.  We'll work hard in 1995 to help investors 
understand our business prospects, and then hopefully they'll appraise our 
future the way we do.  As a diversified utility, Minnesota Power offers 
investors an attractive combination - solid utility businesses coupled with 
non-regulated investments that give us more growth potential than a "plain 
vanilla" utility.  That's the message we're carrying to Wall Street.

Are you concerned about the Company's high dividend payout?

In 1994 we paid out in dividends 98% of our earnings.  That's high, but given 
our cash resources and our lack of major utility construction needs, it should 
not be detrimental.  Longer-term, our goal is to reduce dividend payout to 70% 
of earnings; unlike some utilities, however, we don't plan to do it by reducing 
dividends but rather by increasing earnings.  We're confident we can increase 
earnings, and this is the message I believe our board of directors was sending 
when we raised the dividend in January 1995.

Do you think market concerns about electric utility deregulation and 
competition are hurting us?

It's possible.  There's a perception in the market that retail electric 
competition, if it comes, is going to be somewhat more difficult for us than 
for the typical utility because we have large 

2

<PAGE>
industrial customers who theoretically might be courted by other power 
suppliers if there were full retail competition.  I don't agree. In 1994 six of 
our nine largest industrial power customers extended their long-term contracts; 
this doubled the amount of revenue under contract between now and 2005, and the 
average contract duration is now between six and seven years. Our customers 
aren't signing with us just because we're nice folks (although we are).  
They're doing it because our retail rates are the lowest in the region and 
among the lowest in the country. Our customers are voting with their contract-
signing pens, and not with their feet.

How will you keep electric rates competitive?

Smart cost control is the answer. We'll be spending somewhat less on 
construction over the next several years, compared with prior years. We're 
being more aggressive in seeing if we can't use existing facilities longer than 
we might have in the past. We're focusing expenditures in areas where there are 
good possibilities for either substantial savings or revenue growth. A new 
customer information system we put in place in 1994 will help us serve 
customers better and more efficiently.  A new energy management system, 
beginning in 1995, will help us compete for regional electric sales and provide 
new power-related services in the future.  

Do you see growth opportunities for the electric utility?

If we serve our customers well, we'll do well. We will pursue any growth 
initiatives, traditional or not, that have a reasonable chance of being 
profitable. There are some growth constraints, however, such as demand-side 
management, the conservation ethic, and the lack of customer growth in our 
service area. On the other hand, there are processes in the steel and paper 
industries that can be done electrically that are now being done less 
efficiently with other energy forms. New electrotechnologies can mean sales 
growth for us and solve problems for customers by removing production 
bottlenecks and helping them remain competitive in their markets.

What's your assessment of utility competition/deregulation scenarios?

Generally, I feel fewer electric utility CEOs now believe there will be wide-
open retail competition than, say, a year ago. The shock wave from California's 
deregulation proposal has subsided. Ironically, one factor tending to slow 
retail competition is that utilities, including us, have been acting more and 
more as if full competition and deregulation had already occurred.  We've been 
trimming costs and offering large industrial customers rate flexibility for 
years. The gates of competition may open further, but many issues need to be 
addressed first. Besides utilities themselves and their customers, myriad 
federal and state regulatory bodies have stakes in the outcome and roles to 
play. Sorting out the complexities and resolving the issues will not be easy, 
and there will be reluctance to jeopardize the benefits traditional regulation 
has given us. Hopefully, rationality and logic will prevail, as well as a sense 
of fairness in how to handle utility investments made in good faith under the 
present system of regulation.

What are the growth prospects for water utilities?

Customer growth in our water utility businesses has been running 3% to 4% per 
year, not counting acquisitions or asset sales. There will probably be more 
opportunities for water utility acquisitions because the industry is still 
fragmented.  Nationally, there's a trend toward privatization of smaller 
municipal systems,


This ad ran in regional newspapers following the January 1995 announcement of 
our dividend increase.

Minnesota Power's 25th Consecutive Dividend Increase

On the occasion of our 25th consecutive annual dividend increase*, we'd like to 
tell you about our course for the future.

Some utilities have cut dividends. Not Minnesota Power. Our policy is to 
maintain our dividend, and to keep raising it as earnings grow. It yields 8% 
based on our current stock price of about $25.

In the mid-80s, we realized we should no longer rely exclusively on our 
electric business. We have the financial strength to diversify, and we're doing 
it with ingenuity and success. The new Minnesota Power has three main parts:

[CLIPART OF ELECTRICAL PLUG]
Our traditional electric utility base, including secure long-term contracts 
with large industrial customers, and 11.6% authorized return.

[CLIPART OF WATER FAUCET]
Water utilities, growing and providing an increasingly valuable commodity in 
Florida and the Carolinas.

[CLIPART OF THREE ARROWS]
Nonregulated affiliates, with potential growth and returns higher than 
utilities.

* On January 25, Minnesota Power (NYSE:MPL) increased the dividend on its 
common stock, equivalent to an annual rate of $2.04, compared with $2.02 paid 
in 1994. This higher quarterly dividend is payable March 1 to shareholders of 
record on February 15.

and we may be able to either buy them or manage them for a fee. Beyond actual 
utility operations, there are other water-related services and products we 
could offer.

Does the pending ADESA acquisition signal a shift in 
diversification strategy, in that it is so different from any 
of our other businesses?

Certainly, the type of service ADESA performs is a departure, but ADESA is more 
like other businesses we have than you might think - and in some very key ways. 
Since 1983, financial services have been an important component of our Company; 
our securities portfolio and Capital Re, the reinsurance firm of which we own 
21%, are both examples. ADESA, too, provides a corporate service: It brings 
auto buyers and sellers together, similar to a stock or commodity exchange.  
ADESA does not own the vehicles it auctions, but rather provides services for 
both buyers and sellers. It's a niche service business for the automotive 
industry, which is huge.  And ADESA is a large player in this niche. 
This acquisition may have little to do with utilities, but it has a lot to do 
with our profit strategy. I recently reviewed a Wall Street Journal article 
from September of 1993 that talks about Cox Broadcasting, a private firm that 
owns Manheim, the largest auto auction company. Cox is considered an astute 
company. The article, in sum, said that auto auctions had nothing to do with 
Cox's broadcasting business, but had a lot to do with its profits.

Headquartered in Indianapolis, ADESA operates auto auctions at Indianapolis, 
Boston, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati/Dayton, Knoxville, Lexington, Memphis, 
Charlotte, Birmingham, Sarasota/Bradenton, Miami and Austin. In Canada ADESA 
auctions are at Montreal, Ottawa and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The ADESA File

Merger Proposal

Agreement is for us to buy an 80% stake in ADESA Corporation for $167 million 
($162 million upon completing merger plus $5 million for stock owned prior to 
merger agreement).  The companies' boards have approved a definitive merger 
agreement, and ADESA shareholders will vote on it by mid-1995.

The Business

North America's third-largest auto auction company, ADESA owns and operates 16 
facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Auction buyers are car dealers; sellers 
include domestic auto manufacturers, import auto makers, car dealers, 
fleet/lease companies, banks and finance companies.  Revenue comprises auction 
fees paid by sellers and buyers and charges for auxiliary services that include 
auto reconditioning, body and paint work, remarketing, dealer financing and 
transportation services.

The Numbers

ADESA sold 410,000 vehicles in 1994, generating net income of $7.8 million on 
revenue of $94 million.  In 1992 it sold 184,000 cars, with net income of $3.6 
million and revenue of $46 million.

Growth Strategy

To acquire and consolidate independent auto auctions and begin new ones.

Customer Philosophy

To have "a servant's attitude," ready to do whatever is necessary to serve 
those who use ADESA auctions.

But other utilities are not out buying car auctions.

The fact that a host of other utilities aren't following the same strategy we 
are doesn't worry me, actually. I'm not a contrarian by nature, but I don't 
think following the same path every other utility follows will necessarily lead 
to success. A crowded path may mean there isn't that much revenue and earnings 
growth available, and the competition will be intense. We've looked at a lot of 
businesses in the 12 years since we decided to diversify, we've studied ADESA 
in detail, and that's why we're confident it's a good buy for us and at a fair 
price.

What was the process used to find ADESA?

First we worked through a firm that finds potential buys for companies that are 
looking to expand through acquisition.  We wanted a business with manageable 
risk and the potential for growth and returns higher than those of a typical 
utility business.  We looked at firms in 25 to 30 different industries, 
beginning with utility-related businesses and then gradually broadening our 
scope.  We considered international electric utility operations, but ruled them 
out because we felt they were too risky.  We looked at oil and gas exploration, 
finally rejecting this business because it's too cyclical.  We considered title 
insurance, but that business, too, is cyclical and linked to interest rates.  
Manufacturing was too capital-intensive.  ADESA surfaced as a potential 
acquisition in mid-1994 and appeared to meet most of our criteria.  We studied 
it thoroughly, involving our own corporate development people as well as 
outside investment advisors.  Our first impression, like many people's, was 
colored by stereotypes about used car salesmen.  A closer look dispelled the 
stereotypes, however.  And the closer we looked, the more we were impressed 
with ADESA's business prospects and the better the financial fit we saw between 
the two companies.

What do you like about ADESA?

Its business fundamentals are solid. It's not cyclical. It has good cash flow, 
and its revenue and income growth have been in the range of 30% a year for the 
past three years.  Growth in the auto redistribution industry overall has 
averaged about 10% a year for the past decade, reflecting a growing supply of 
rental cars, a boom in leasing as well as the increasing price of new vehicles. 
We also like that this business is not as capital-intensive as our utility 
businesses.  For example, our electric utility had over $3 invested in 
facilities to earn $1 of revenue in 1994.  In contrast, ADESA generated about 
$1.25 in revenue for every $1 of capital it had invested in facilities. That's 
an advantage when you're planning on expanding.  Another thing we liked about 
ADESA is that its values were compatible with ours.

What values do you mean?

I mean basic values:  Ethics.  Honesty.  Being customer-oriented.  Its auction 
facilities are huge, modern, spotless.  It reconditions the cars and does 
repainting and body work. It delivers vehicles to and from customers, using its 
own fleet of modern transport trailers.  It provides remarketing services and 
makes short-term loans to dealers until they sell the vehicles. It handles all 
the paperwork, using computerized equipment to expedite the process at every 
point.  ADESA provides one-stop shopping for car dealers.

What does Minnesota Power bring to the merger?

Our primary role is to provide expansion capital in accordance with approved 
business plans. We're not going to try to reculturize ADESA or make a utility 
out of them. We want them to continue to do what they've been doing, only more 
of it and even better.  That's why we're retaining ADESA's key top managers; 
they will run the business and direct its growth.

How will the company expand?

We believe the auto redistribution business, like the water utility business 
since the mid-1980s, is in a period of consolidation. There are three large 
players in the industry, of which ADESA is the third-largest. But over half the 
13 million vehicles a year that go through auctions are handled by independent 
companies that typically don't offer the breadth of service ADESA does.  ADESA 
will expand by acquiring independent auctions and starting up large, new 
facilities. Its existing auctions can also become more profitable by handling 
more cars.

Even if ADESA does well, how can you earn a good return when you pay such a 
premium for the business?

It's true that if you divide the company's past-year income by the $167 million 
we are paying to acquire 80% ownership, it works out to a single-digit return. 
Believe me, we do not part with that much money easily.  But we learned early 
in our diversification efforts that you have to pay a premium for a good 
business.  The way you increase the return is through growth and expansion.

What do you look for in 1995 in terms of Minnesota Power's overall performance?

I look to 1995 for a better financial year for our paper and recycled fiber 
businesses, better results in our water businesses, and continued good earnings 
for the electric utility. We expect to close the ADESA deal and tell our story 
effectively to investors so they fully understand our Company's strengths and 
so our stock is fully valued in the market.  And, of course, we'll prove that 
value through performance.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all Company employees for their 
hard work over the past year. The 11 accomplishments featured in this report 
are representative of the kind of work our employees do whether they live in 
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida, the Carolinas or North Dakota.  I would also 
like to thank shareholders and ask for your continuing support as we try to 
increase the value of your investment and make you proud to own part of 
Minnesota Power.

REVIEW AND OUTLOOK
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

     Once exclusively an electric utility, Minnesota Power has in the past 
decade invested in a variety of non-electric businesses.

     Our purpose in diversifying was threefold:  First, we wanted to reduce the 
Company's heavy dependence on electric sales to a small number of large 
customers in taconite mining, an industry whose fate is tied to steel 
manufacturing.  Second, we wanted to increase our growth potential beyond what 
we projected for our electric business.  Third, in the case of investments such 
as our Duluth paper and recycled pulp plants, we also wanted to create jobs and 
boost the economy in our electric utility service area.
     We feel diversification has served us well and is a valid strategy for 
meeting our future goals: 
     .    To increase earnings to a minimum of $3.25 per share by the year 
2000; 
     .    To maintain our financial strength and increase the value of our 
shareholders' investment; and 
     .    To nurture a customer-driven, quality-oriented corporate culture 
that is both internally cooperative and externally competitive.
     To hit our earnings target, we will need to sustain the good financial 
performance of our electric utility, achieving our authorized rate of return.  
We will need earnings growth from our water utilities through customer growth, 
additional acquisitions, and rates that reflect our investment in facilities to 
meet increasing water demand and government-mandated environmental standards.
     This won't be enough, however.  We will need to supplement the regulated 
income from our electric and water utilities with income growth and higher 
returns from non-regulated businesses.

     Our goal is that by the year 2000 each of our core businesses, electric 
and water utilities, would provide about one-third of Minnesota Power's income. 
The remaining third would come from non-regulated investments, including a 
proposed acquisition we announced recently.In February 1995 Minnesota Power and 
ADESA Corporation signed a merger agreement in which ADESA, an auto auction 
firm with 16 outlets in the United States and Canada, would become our 80%-
owned subsidiary.

The Paper Goes 
'Round and Round'

In 1994 Minnesota Power's electric utility operations collected and recycled 
98,362 lbs. of white paper, 99,079 lbs. of mixed paper plus mountains of 
magazines, phone books, cardboard, newsprint, aluminum, glass and plastic - all 
because Cindy McLean decided one day in 1989 that "somebody should get us 
organized." Most collected materials are sold. (Paper goes to our Superior 
Recycled Fiber Industries operation.) The reduced cost of trash hauling is a 
valuable bonus.  In the photo, Cindy is pictured on the right with Debbie 
Bulloch, who recently took over the leadership of the 
recycling program.

<PAGE>
The $167 million transaction is scheduled for completion by mid-1995 
following approval by ADESA shareholders.
     ADESA's management will retain 20% ownership. Under the agreement, they
have the right to sell, and Minnesota Power has the right to buy, their 20% in
increments during the 1997-99 period at a price linked to ADESA's financial
performance.
     The money for buying and expanding ADESA and the possible acquisition of 
more water companies will come mainly from our securities portfolio.  We expect 
to retain our investment in Capital Re Corporation.  We will continue selling 
our southwest Florida real estate and expect to sell all or nearly all the 
property by 2000.
     Another shift in resources is possible in 1995.  Pentair, Inc. - our 
joint-venture partner in Lake Superior Paper Industries - has announced its 
desire to exit the paper business, which would likely entail selling LSPI.  We 
believe a sale could improve the chances for expanding the Duluth mill, which 
was originally designed for more than one paper machine.  Our position as half-
owner is that we would join in a sale under the right conditions.  If LSPI is 
sold, it may be logical to also consider a simultaneous sale of Superior 
Recycled Fiber Industries (SRFI), whose paper recycled fiber plant 
is adjacent to and operated by LSPI.

1994 Performance

     Earnings per share of common stock for 1994 were $2.06, compared with 
$2.20 in 1993 and $2.47 in 1992.

     The largest single factor in the lower earnings was a decline in the 
performance of the Company's securities investment portfolio.

     Though the portfolio was profitable for the year, its income was reduced 
55 cents per share from the previous year due to lower returns, including 
declines in the value of some securities, and the 21-cent-per-share write-off 
of one investment. Also contributing to lower 1994 earnings was an 11-cent-per-
share loss from our investment in Reach All Partnership, a Duluth manufacturer 
of truck-mounted lifting equipment in which the Company has an 82.5% interest.
     Kilowatt-hour sales increased 4% in 1994, reflecting an increase in sales 
to large industrial customers and resale customers.  Despite this and higher 
retail electric rates that went into effect on an interim basis March 1, 1994, 
income from electric utility operations was down  from the previous year.
     The Company's water utility operations were helped by higher rates, but 
that benefit was offset by heavy summer rains that reduced water consumption.  
A $19.1 million gain from the sale of water plant facilities increased water 
utility operations income over 1993, contributing 42 cents per share to income.
     Minnesota Power's coal mining business and sales of Florida real estate 
turned in solid performances in 1994,surpassing their 1993 income.  Our Duluth 
paper mill, helped by a rebound in paper prices last fall, went from a $3.7 
million pre-tax loss in 1993 to a $3.1 million pre-tax profit for 1994; the 
Company recognizes 50% of the mill's pre-tax earnings.  SRFI, which began 
operating in late 1993, contributed $906,000 to corporate earnings in 1994.

COMPARING FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM 1994, 1993 AND 1992

Operating Revenue and Income

     Electric utility operations revenue was lower in 1994 than 1993, because 
the Company recognized $5.1 million of unbilled revenue and recovered $14.6 
million more of coal contract termination costs in 1993. Also, National Steel 
Pellet Co., a taconite producer that purchases its electricity from the 
Company, operated for seven months in 1993 compared with four months in 1994. 
Additional revenue in 1994 of $11.1 million from the interim rate increase 
partially offset the decreases in revenue. Revenue was higher in 1993 than 
1992, because 1993 included $4 million more of the coal contract termination 
cost recovery, $2.5 million more in unbilled revenue, and increased sales to 
resale customers.
     Water utility operations revenue was higher in 1994 than 1993 because of 
higher water rates and a $19.1 million gain from the sale of water plant 
assets. However, 1994 revenue from ongoing operations was less than expected 
because abnormally high rainfall reduced consumption 8%. Revenue was higher in 
1993 than 1992 because of higher water rates.
     Investments and corporate services revenue was higher in 1994 than 1993 
because SRFI, which began operating in November 1993, had $47.2 million more 
revenue in 1994. The $10.1 million write-off of an investment, lower returns 
and the decline in value of some securities due to higher interest rates 
lowered 1994 income. 1993 income was increased by a $2.7 million gain on a 
leveraged preferred stock investment but reduced by $8.1 million to reflect new 
accounting rules for employee stock ownership plans. 1992 income includes a 
$5.1 million gain from the redemption by the issuer of a preferred stock 
investment.

Operating Expenses

     Fuel and purchased power expenses were lower in 1994 than 1993 because the 
monthly amortization of coal contract termination costs was completed in March 
1994; 1993 included $14.6 million more of these costs than 1994. 1994 expenses 
included additional purchased power to provide for unscheduled outages at our 
Boswell power plant and to meet unexpected demand from three taconite 
customers. Expenses were higher in 1993 than 1992 because additional purchased 
power was used during scheduled maintenance at Company power plants.
     Operations expenses were higher in 1994 than 1993, reflecting the fact 
that SRFI began full operations in November 1993.  Expenses were higher in 1993 
than 1992 due to scheduled power plant maintenance and higher property taxes.
     Administrative and general expenses were higher in 1994 than 1993 and 1992 
due to salary and benefit increases.
     Interest expense was higher in 1994 than 1993, reflecting $45 million of 
new debt financing obtained for SRFI at the end of 1993.  Expense was lower in 
1993 than 1992 because of refinancings at lower interest rates.
     Income from equity investments was higher in 1994 than 1993 because of 
additional income from our increased ownership in Capital Re and improved 
earnings from LSPI due to higher paper prices. Income was lower in 1993 than 
1992 because of LSPI's loss. The Company recognized losses from its investment 
in Reach All in all three years.
     Income tax expense was lower in 1994 than 1993.  Effective tax rates were 
25.9% in 1994, 30.1% in 1993, and 26.9% in 1992.  The effective tax rate was 
lower in 1994 than 1993, due primarily to tax credits generated by affordable 
housing investments and the recognition of income from escrow funds that had 
been previously taxed.  The effective tax rate was higher in 1993 than 1992, 
reflecting a 1% increase in the federal income tax rate in 1993 and fewer tax 
benefits generated by the investment portfolio.

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

     Electric utilities are undergoing a transformation as efforts to stimulate 
competition begin to take effect. How far open competition will go and whether 
it will apply to retail customers, however, is not clear.

     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposals have altered the 
competitive landscape, affecting transmission access and pricing. Under FERC's 
transmission access policies, competitors can gain access to a utility's 
transmission system, at rates set by FERC, to compete for sales to the 
utility's wholesale customers.  While utilities have commonly allowed use of 
their lines for wholesale power transactions, most object to being required to 
transmit or "wheel" a competing electric supplier's power to the utility's own 
retail customers.
     With our low rates, Minnesota Power is well positioned to meet 
competition. However, we remain opposed to retail wheeling. We believe it would 
benefit only a few large customers while causing smaller users' rates to rise 
dramatically and shareholder returns to fail to pay for capacity built on the 
strength of future promises of cost recovery.  At present there are no 
proposals that, in our view, adequately address this stranded investment issue.
     Recent developments suggest that retail wheeling, if it comes, is not 
expected for some time.  Though Minnesota and other states are studying it - 
the most publicized proposal has been in California - retail wheeling is in use 
only in rare locations in this country.  One disincentive is that states like 
Minnesota require utilities to invest in social and environmental programs that 
could be jeopardized if their electric utilities had to compete head-to-head 
with outside energy suppliers.  Moreover, Minnesota's generally low electric 
rates, half those of California, provide little incentive to change a system 
that has been working well.

     Despite uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of change in our industry, 
Minnesota Power is preparing for a more competive future.

     Our methods include cost cutting, pursuing legislative and regulatory 
reforms to assure we compete with other power suppliers on a level playing 
field, realigning our business functions to make it easier to price and market 
"unbundled" products and services, and cementing relationships with customers 
through innovative pricing and excellent service. We will learn more about our 
customers as well as our competitors and use that information strategically.  
We expect to expand our product offerings and build our customer base through 
economic development and other initiatives. We will continue working to extend 
electric service contracts with our largest customers, a strategy that achieved 
good results in 1994.
     We see ourselves increasingly as energy service providers.  We look at our 
customers' objectives as joint challenges. By finding ways to help them 
conserve energy and cut costs, we help them become more productive. And that 
increased productivity, we have found, can result in increased electric power 
use longer-term for industrial customers as they compete with other operations.
     We also encourage energy-saving electrotechnologies. We are promoting 
ground-source heat pumps in residential and commercial markets. More efficient 
than conventional

Ashes to Ashes

The northern Minnesota community of Hibbing, a Minnesota Power wholesale 
electric customer, had a problem.  The city, which operates a power plant of 
its own, was running out of landfill space for its 7,000 tons of ash per year. 
We offered to dispose of it at the Boswell Energy Center ash pond. Trucks that 
carry the ash away make the trip pay by back-hauling coal, which fuels 
Hibbing's power plant. It's a creative, economical, environmentally sound 
solution. Pictured: Heidi Jagodzinski, Boswell environmental engineer, 
submitted the ash disposal plan to the state. Jack Hokkanen is a customer 
representative for our large municipal accounts. Both credit others for making 
the idea work.

Averaging rates for all service classes, our customers paid 44% less for their 
power than utility customers elsewhere in the country.

electric heating and cooling systems, ground-source heat pumps are especially 
cost-effective where the user wants both air conditioning and heating. With 
normal usage, energy savings will offset installation costs in three to five 
years.

     The continued financial health of Minnesota Power's electric utility 
business depends on the financial viability of our large industrial customers, 
particularly taconite producers and paper manufacturers.

     Both industries compete in global markets and, therefore, need to control 
costs and increase their productivity.  Through energy audits, we have helped 
our large industrial customers identify cost-effective conservation measures as 
well as projects that will improve production efficiencies.  These improvements 
are funded through state-mandated Conservation Improvement Program grants.
     In many ways, we have always competed to serve our large industrial 
customers.  Because of their size, they have had the option to generate their 
own power if they felt they could do it more economically than buying from us.  
Paper mills, which require steam for their manufacturing process, are ideal 
candidates for building their own cogeneration facilities, which operate 
efficiently by burning a fuel to make steam for papermaking as well as electric 
generation.  Federal law says that when cogenerators meet certain conditions, 
utilities must purchase their surplus power.
     In recent years, the Company has offered customers a wider choice of 
electric service options.  For example, interruptible rates for large 
industrial customers offer a price discount in return for agreeing to have 
service interrupted on occasion.  Another example:  state law allows us, with 
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approval, to offer lower rates to service 
area customers who could otherwise obtain energy from an unregulated supplier 
or generate their own electricity.  The Company is exploring the joint 
development of cogeneration facilities with some of its key customers to meet 
future energy needs.

1994 Performance

     The Company's electric utility business performed well in 1994.  Kilowatt-
hour sales rose 4% to their second-highest level ever despite the idling of one 
of our largest customers for seven months of the year.

     Revenue was boosted by a 7% interim retail rate increase.  Customers also 
saw the full impact of savings from new coal purchase and transportation 
contracts, which more than offset the final electric rate increase for our 
largest customers and reduced it for others.  In the 

10

<PAGE>
second half of the year, six of our nine largest industrial customers extended 
their electric service contracts, more than doubling the amount of revenue 
committed to us in the 1995-2005 period.
     We sharpened our focus on customer service, streamlining operations in 
some areas while emphasizing others where there is the greatest potential for 
growth and likelihood of competition.  We also realigned the functions in our 
electric utility business to address the more competitive future many are 
predicting for our industry.

     Two industries - taconite production and the manufacture of paper and wood 
products - accounted for 49% of the Company's electric operating revenue in 
1994, versus 48% in 1993 and 51% in 1992.

     An encouraging development during 1994 was the dramatic turnaround in the 
market for pulp and paper. Electric sales to paper and other wood-products 
customers in 1994 were up 5% over 1993 and 3% over 1992. Paper and wood-
products firms provided 14% of electric operating revenue each of the last 
three years.
     The paper industry is in better condition than it has been in many years. 
Its additional energy use benefited us, as we provide power to all four of 
northern Minnesota's largest paper mills.  During the year we extended power 
contracts with Blandin Paper Co., Boise Cascade, and Lake Superior Paper 
Industries. One existing customer, Potlatch Corporation's paper division in 
Brainerd, signed a four-year contract as a Large Power customer for 10 
megawatts through November 1999; MPUC approval has been requested.
     Taconite production provided 35% of electric operating revenue in 1994, 
34% in 1993 and 37% in 1992.  An important raw material for steelmaking, 
taconite pellets are made from iron-bearing rock. In an energy-intensive 
process, the rock is blasted from the earth, crushed and ground into powder. 
The iron is magnetically separated, concentrated and rolled into a pellet with 
a uniform 65% iron content for shipping to steel mills on the lower Great 
Lakes.
     In 1994 the taconite industry recorded its best year since 1981, producing 
more than 43 million tons of pellets, and it is expecting to produce 
approximately 48 million tons in 1995. In August 1994 we resumed providing 
power to National after a lapse of 12 months while the plant was idled. The 
Keewatin, Minn., plant is now fully operational and is expected to produce 5 
million tons of taconite pellets in 1995, more than 10% of Minnesota's total 
projected shipments. Though we had largely compensated for the loss of this 
business through tight cost controls and the sale of power to other utilities, 
National's return is a boon to the region and sounds an encouraging note for 
1995.
     In addition to signing a 10-year contract with National, we renewed 
contracts with USX's Minntac plant and Hibbing Taconite. In January 1995, we 
extended our contract to supply power to Eveleth Mines through 1999.

     In November the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission granted us a retail 
rate increase, our first since 1981.

     The new rates will increase annual revenue by about $19 million, beginning 
in 1995. Our initial request, filed in January 1994, had been for a $34 million 
increase, but we reduced it to $27 million for 1994 and $23 million for

Increased Coal-Handling Efficiency at Boswell

Teamwork is paying off in the coal yard at our largest power plant, Boswell 
Energy Center, near Cohasset, Minn. By modifying their coal-handling system, 
Boswell workers improved efficiency and eliminated the need for one dozer, 
saving its leasing, fuel, and maintenance costs. A new stacker and changes in 
conveyor routing make it possible to unload an entire train without moving coal 
to remote stockpiles, adding flexibility and efficiency in feeding the coal to 
the boilers. The improvement is too new to report cost savings, but they will 
be substantial. Among key members of the changeover team are, from left, Mark 
Pinney, fuels planner; Ed Mackey, utility operator; Tom Geiselman, engineer; 
and Joe Reis, senior instrument and control specialist.

Comparing Results from 
1994 and 1993

     Total electric sales increased 4% primarily because of increased sales to 
large industrial customers, wholesale customers and other power suppliers.  
Revenue increased $11.1 million from interim rates collected since March 1, 
1994, and  $7.8 million from the recovery of CIP expenses in 1994.  Approval by 
the MPUC initiated recovery of CIP expenses beginning Jan. 1, 1994.  Revenue 
was lowered by $12.4 million because of reduced demand revenue from National 
and lower rates associated with interruptible service.  The Company also 
completed recovery of the remaining $3.9 million of coal contract buyout costs 
in March 1994, whereas 1993 included $18.5 million, a full year of recovery.  
Additionally, the unbilled revenue adjustment added $5.1 million to revenue in 
1993.
     Electric operations earned a return of 12.8% on average common equity 
devoted to electric utility plant in 1994, compared with 12.4% in 1993.

Comparing Results from 
1993 and 1992

     Despite work stoppages at two of the Company's largest industrial 
customers, revenue was slightly higher in 1993 due to increased sales to resale 
and other customers.  In addition, a $5.1 million adjustment relating to the 
recognition of unbilled revenue increased 1993 electric utility operations 
revenue.
     Electric operations earned a 12.4% return on average common equity devoted 
to the electric utility plant in 1993, compared with 14.4% in 1992. These 
returns do not include the recognition of unbilled revenue. The recognition of 
a $3.4 million revenue credit from a court decision contributed to the higher 
return in 1992.

1995 to reflect updated revenue and expense projections. The MPUC authorized an 
11.6% return on equity invested in our electric utility.
     Just as important to us for competitive reasons, the MPUC supported our 
request that the increase be larger for residential customers to reflect the 
higher cost of serving them and the need to keep the region's industrial 
customers competitive in their global markets.
     As a result of the rate increase, rates for large industrial customers 
will rise less than 4%, while those for small businesses will go up 6.5%. The 
increase for residential customers will be phased in over three years: 13.5% 
beginning 

12

<PAGE>
in 1995, 3.75% in January 1996 and another 3.75% in January 1997.  Even after 
the full increase, our residential customers will still pay nearly 25% less 
than the 1994 national average.
     The increase for large industrial users will be more than offset by 
savings in coal purchase and transportation  costs, savings we are passing on 
to all customers. The savings result from new contracts negotiated with 
suppliers in recent years and whose full effect began being felt in 1994.
     The MPUC's 1994 rate decision also allows us to recover through rates $1.3 
million a year to pay for decommissioning coal-fired power plants when they 
reach the end of their useful lives.
     The new rates are expected to go into effect in the second quarter of 
1995.  However, the Company began collecting an interim rate increase of 7% on 
March 1, 1994.  In second quarter 1995 we expect to determine amounts of 
interim rate-related revenue, if any, the Company must refund with interest to 
customers.  As of Dec. 31, 1994, the Company had reserved $6.1 million of the 
interim rate revenue for anticipated refunds.
     The rate increase seems to have had little effect on the Company's good 
standing with customers. A recent opinion survey indicates that we have a 
favorable rating of 91% among residential customers, compared with 92% in 1993. 
Across the nation, a typical favorability rating for electric utilities is 71%.

     Minnesota requires electric utilities to spend 1.5% of their electric 
revenue on conservation improvement programs (CIP) each year.

     Because taconite and paper customers provide the bulk of Minnesota Power's 
electric operating revenue, the  largest of these programs are targeted at 
them. CIP also funds demand-side management grants, awarded on a competitive 
basis to commercial and small industrial customers, as well as energy 
conservation initiatives aimed at all our customers.  In 1995 we proposed a 
program that would allow us to provide low-cost financing for energy-saving 
investments.
     State law allows utilities to recover state-approved conservation program 
costs through an annual customer billing adjustment. In January 1994 the 
Company began recovering ongoing 1994 CIP spending and $8.2 million of CIP 
spending from previous years.  The billing adjustment, which must be 
reauthorized by the MPUC annually, has been allowing us to recover not only 
what we spend on these energy-saving programs, but also "lost margins" 
associated with power saved as a result of them.  1994 electric operating 
revenue included $7.8 million of CIP-related revenue.  About $5.7 million for 
CIP expenditures was included in operating expenses.
     SWL&P also offers electric and gas conservation programs to its Wisconsin 
customers in accord with Wisconsin state policies.

     Our nine largest customers, accounting for about 49% of electric operating 
revenue, are served under long-term contracts.

     The contracts, which in January 1995 averaged over six years in length, 
each require 10 megawatts or more of power and have termination dates from 
April 1997 to December 2005. Five of these customers are taconite producers and 
four are paper manufacturers.

While working at SWL&P's new water treatment plant, Brian Denston developed 
forearm pain requiring treatment and physical therapy. He felt it was caused by 
strain from raking sludge off the walls of the plant's reclaim clarifier. After 
studying the problem, Brian and his colleagues decided to design an electric 
pump to do the job. Ergonomic improvements like this help keep the lid on 
insurance costs.  Pictured, clockwise from left: Jim Jordan, Skip VanDamme, Bob

     The contracts provide that, even at low electric usage levels, these 
customers will pay us enough to cover most of the fixed costs of having 
capacity available to serve them, including a return on equity.  The contracts 
require four years notice before they can be cancelled, although the rates paid 
under the contracts are subject to change through the regulatory process 
governing all retail electric rates. 
     In December 1994 Minnesota Power asked the MPUC to approve two additional 
rates for retail customers.  First, an economic development rate would give 
discounts to customers who invest in new capital improvements or equipment and 
increase electrical load on our system.  Second, an incremental sales rider to 
an existing contract would allow more flexibility for some customers to operate 
above their specified contract demand levels in certain months and pay only 
energy charges for the incremental load.
     For the next five years we are projecting relative stability in overall 
kilowatt-hour sales.  While taconite production in 1995 is expected to continue 
at near-record levels, the longer-term future of this cyclical industry is less 
certain.  While we are doing all we can to help all our taconite customers 
remain competitive, it is possible that production will decline gradually some 
time after the year 2000.

     Company generating stations in 1994 burned 3.4 million tons of coal, the 
cost of which is our largest operating expense.

     In December 1991 we paid Peabody Coal Company $35 million to terminate its 
long-term coal contract two years ahead of the scheduled termination date.  The 
cost was amortized monthly and collected from customers through a fuel 
adjustment provision until March 1994. Revenue collected this way amounted to 
$3.9 million in 1994, $18.5 million in 1993, and $14.5 million in 1992. Savings 
from the new coal supply agreements are being passed on to customers.
     In 1993 Minnesota Power entered into a contract with Peabody that extends
through May 1997 for up to two-thirds of our coal needs. The rest will be 
purchased on the spot market through one-year agreements, taking advantage of 
favorable market conditions. We are exploring supply options beyond 1997 that 
provide for a mix of long-, intermediate- and short-term purchases.  We believe
adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be 
available. 
     In February 1993 the Company renegotiated two contracts with Burlington 
Northern Railroad to deliver coal to our plants through December 2003 at 
reduced rates.  These new contracts also provide for better access to all major
coal production areas within the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming.

The Company believes revenue from contracts with large industrial 
customers will substantially exceed the minimum contract amounts. In fact, 
assuming the new rates and large power contracts that are pending MPUC approval 
are put in place, annual minimum revenue will increase $16 
million to $28 million for each year through 1999.

     A lignite-fired minemouth power plant in North Dakota provides us with an 
economical supply of electricity.
     Under an agreement extending through 2007, the Company purchases 71% 
(about 307 megawatts during summer months and 322 megawatts during winter 
months) of the output of a mine-mouth generating unit owned by the Square Butte 
Electric Cooperative.  The Square Butte unit is one of two units at Minnkota 
Power Cooperative's Milton R. Young Generation Station near Center, N.D.
     Square Butte has the option, upon five years advance notice, to reduce our 
share of the unit's output to 49%. Minnesota Power has the option, though not 
the obligation, to continue to purchase 49% of the output at market-based 
prices after 2007 and through the end of the plant's economic life. Minnesota 
Power must pay any Square Butte costs and expenses that have not been paid by 
Square Butte when due, regardless of whether or not we receive any power from 
that unit.
     While many utilities and their customers will face higher costs to comply 
with clean-air legislation, we expect to meet future requirements without major 
spending.
     Burning low-sulfur fuels and equipped with pollution control equipment, 
our power plants already operate at or near the sulfur dioxide emission limits 
set for the year 2000 by the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. To meet 
nitrogen oxide emission limits for 2000, we expect to install new burner 
technology.  Total clean-air compliance costs cannot be accurately estimated 
yet, as regulations are not final.
     A settlement was reached in 1994 in an Environmental Protection Agency 
Superfund action to clean up pollution at a northern Minnesota oil refinery 
site.  Minnesota Power, along with roughly 130 other companies and several 
government entities, agreed on a $37 million proposal, which was submitted for 
approval to regulatory agencies. 
     Under the settlement, Minnesota Power's share of cleanup costs is about 
$314,000, all of which has been paid.  Other related legal and internal costs 
have totaled about $550,000 since 1990, when the suit was initiated. Cleanup is 
expected to begin in 1995.  Minnesota Power's electric utility is not the 
subject of any other environmental lawsuits.

     BNI Coal mined a record 4.4 million tons of lignite coal, produced its 
highest-ever net income of $3.1 million, and had no lost-time accidents in 
1994.
     Already North Dakota's lowest-cost producer of lignite - 24% less 
expensive than the next-lowest supplier in terms of cost per British thermal 
unit of energy in 1994 - BNI Coal should further increase its efficiency with 
the addition of $5 million in new scrapers and bulldozers in 1995. 
     BNI Coal's lignite is burned at the nearby Milton R. Young Station's two 
generating units.  Thanks largely to its economical coal supply, the Young 
plant in 1993, for the third consecutive year, achieved the second-lowest 
production cost of any power plant in the United States.  Its production cost 
of 10.33 mills per kilowatt-hour was more than 47% lower than the average for 
all coal-fired plants.
     BNI Coal's reserves exceed 500 million tons, leaving ample supply for 
expanded production if additional markets for lignite can be developed. This is 
a challenge because lignite's high moisture content hampers long-distance 
shipping. BNI Coal is working with Minnkota and other interested parties to 
upgrade the quality of the lignite through a process that reduces moisture and 
sulfur content.

BNI Cuts Haul Costs 20%

Minnesota Power's BNI Coal mine at Center, N.D., has replaced eight haul trucks 
of varying capacities and speeds with five new ones that perform the same job 
better. The Kress trucks, manufactured in Brimfield, Ill., carry 180 tons per 
trip, operating faster, safer, and with less driver fatigue. The bottom line, 
according to Pit Operations Manager Steve Hovey, who led the team that 
justified and planned the changeover, is a 20% cut in average haul costs.

                                                                            15

WATER UTILITY OPERATIONS
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS

     Southern States Utilities, which serves about 149,000 customers, is 
Florida's largest privately held supplier of water and wastewater services, 
four times as large as any other independent water utility in the state. 

     As such, SSU represents part of the solution to Florida's historically 
fragmented water service, a welcome change in a state facing a serious 
collective water supply challenge. The company is working with Florida 
regulators and legislators to address concerns such as non-viable systems, 
environmental care and conservation.
     SSU has been granted cost-share funding from the South Florida Water 
Management District to build an aquifer storage and recovery facility to help 
meet long-term water needs of Marco Island, where the water supply is 
deteriorating due to intrusion of brackish sea water. This facility will allow 
SSU to store surplus fresh water in underground limestone formations until it 
is needed in high-demand winter months.  In addition, the Southwest Florida 
Water Management District granted SSU cost-share funding for a wastewater reuse 
project at our Spring Hill plant. 
     By concentrating on customer service, improved earnings, growth, working 
with regulators, and leadership in solving Florida's water supply problems, SSU 
demonstrates Minnesota Power's dedication to a long-term investment in water 
services that will benefit customers, employees, shareholders and the natural 
environment.

     With its service area gaining population at 3% a year, SSU sees 
opportunities for growth in its water business. 

     To stimulate internal growth, SSU encourages land developers to build 
within or adjacent to existing service areas. External growth is expected 
through further acquisitions and through offering management services to public 
utilities that prefer to own, but not operate, their systems.
     SSU continues to hold the line on expenses while adopting new measures to 
improve performance, concentrating on high standards of customer service, 
stewardship of water resources and the environment.
     Strategic planning initiatives include continuing employee training in new 
and evolving technology. Automation is helping increase productivity and 
customer service. Periodic research asks customers to evaluate company 
performance and guide SSU in making improvements.

     A new water testing laboratory at Deltona, Fla., scheduled for July 1995 
completion, will increase efficiency by centralizing most lab procedures, 
reducing costs and dependence on outside providers. It will assure that SSU's 
service meets or exceeds all state and federal water quality standards.
     SSU did not file a general rate case in 1994, but plans in 1995 to request 
an interim annual rate increase of about $10

Financial Health Counts, Too

When Sharon Aleck of our Heater Utilities affiliate saw an increase coming in 
Heater's group medical premiums, she did a little actuarial calculating. 
Finding that premiums had greatly exceeded claims in a recent period, Sharon 
started negotiating with the insurance company. The result: what might have 
been a $100,000-plus increase in annual premiums became an $18,000 decrease, 
even though the number of employees covered grew from 68 to 77.

million and could be seeking as much as $12 million in additional annual 
revenue in final rates. New facilities added since 1992 are not yet included in 
our rate base for earnings purposes. Further, mandated regulatory compliance 
cost increases during the same period, particularly for environmental 
protection, have raised operating expenses and should also be recovered in 
rates.
     Our 1995 filing will include innovations in rate design that will benefit 
both customers and shareholders.  In addition to the previously authorized 
uniform rates, we will propose before the Florida Public Service Commission 
(FPSC)  water conservation incentives and a consistent policy on charges for 
service availability.  These measures, coupled with continuing efforts to 
contain expenses, are expected to improve and provide more consistent earnings.

     SSU applies uniform rates in most of the areas it serves. This rate design 
policy, originally approved by the FPSC in 1993, was reaffirmed in August 1994. 

     Uniform rates recognize that SSU, operating as a statewide utility system, 
provides economical service to all customers, regardless of their location.  A 
uniform rate policy, applied today in many other states, also prevents "rate 
shock" by spreading the cost of capital improvements, reduces rate case 
preparation expenses, and can help promote water conservation. In a state 
facing a future water supply deficit, uniform rates represent sound public 
policy and a long-term benefit to customers and shareholders.
     By Florida law, water and wastewater utilities may make an annual index 
filing to recover inflation in system operation and maintenance expenses, thus 
delaying or avoiding the costs of full rate case filings. Similarly, another 
Florida law allows water and wastewater utilities to file annually to recover 
increased purchased water and wastewater treatment costs and property tax 
increases. Through these filings in 1993 and 1994, SSU requested $3 million in 
annual rate increases and was allowed $2.9 million.
     From 1992 through 1994 our Heater Utilities subsidiary has been granted 
annual water utility rate increases totaling $1.6 million of $2.4 million 
requested since 1991 from regulatory authorities in North Carolina and South 
Carolina. Rate decisions are expected by mid-1995 on additional requested rate 
increases totaling $334,000.  Heater is filing for rate increases affecting 
about 19,000 customers in North Carolina early in 1995.

     SSU's earnings reflected the sale of our water and wastewater facilities 
at Venice Gardens to Sarasota County for $37.6 million, resulting in a $19.1 
million gain.

     This sale was negotiated in anticipation of an eminent domain action by 
the County, which is purchasing private utilities in an effort to consolidate 
services.  Venice Gardens has about 15,500 customers.
     In October 1994 SSU requested approval from the FPSC to buy Orange Osceola 
Utilities, Inc. for about $13 million. Orange Osceola serves 17,000 customers 
in a 2,800-acre residential development near Kissimmee, Fla., close to Walt 
Disney World. SSU expects to conclude this acquisition in mid-1995.

1994 Financial Performance

     Above-normal rainfall in Florida and customer conservation curtailed water 
consumption in 1994, dampening anticipated returns from water utility 
operations.
     Although net income from continuing operations increased from 1993, it 
still fell short of authorized rates of return.  Narrowing the gap between 
actual and allowed earnings is a continuing challenge.  Without the gain from 
the sale of the Venice Gardens facilities, SSU's return on equity in 1994 would 
have been 2.8%.
     In contrast to Florida's heavy rainfall, 1994 was a dry year in the 
Carolinas, helping Heater Utilities achieve an 8.6% average return on equity. 
Heater recorded about 5% growth in its overall customer base, which included 
7.5% growth in the Raleigh-Durham area.
     Heater may lose 3,300 customers in an eminent domain action begun in 
January 1995 for its Seabrook, S.C., assets.  The price Heater will receive 
will be determined by court proceedings.

1994 rainfall was 41% above average in the Orlando area, decreasing water 
consumption and lowering SSU revenue. Authorities cautioned, however, that this 
temporary replenishment of the Florida aquifer does not reduce the need for 
continuing water management, conservation and action to address the sources of 
the state's long-term water deficit.

Works Better, Costs Less

Treatment of drinking water distributed by SSU includes adding a trace of 
chlorine. When the Florida Department of Environmental Protection ordered 
utilities to install chlorination alarms on unattended water facilities, Rich 
Sullo, who works at SSU's Deltona Lakes Plant, had a better idea. He designed 
an alarm system that assures proper chlorination and, if there's a problem, 
shuts down the well and electronically notifies the main plant. This saves time 
and water while maintaining quality standards. Commercially available alarms 
monitor chlorine levels but lack the shutdown feature and cost three times as 
much.

Comparing Financial Results from 1994, 1993 and 1992

     The sale of Venice Gardens assets contributed a $19.1 million gain to 
water utility operations revenue and income.  Operating revenue increased 
slightly due to new rates.  Consumption levels in 1994 were 8% lower than 1993, 
reflecting abnormally high rainfall in Florida during most of the last half of 
the year.
     SSU and Heater had combined net income of $13.3 million in 1994, $1.4 
million in 1993 and a net loss of $2.3 million in 1992.  The revenue from water 
and wastewater treatment services increased approximately 8% in 1993 because of 
higher water rates that have become effective at various dates since June 1992.

     For many years non-utility investments have contributed substantially to 
Minnesota Power earnings.  Their mission is twofold:
     .    To achieve a higher rate of return on investments than we are 
limited to in the regulated sectors of our business; and,
     .    To keep funds available for reinvestment in existing businesses or 
the acquisition of new businesses.

     Over the past decade, our securities investment portfolio has contributed 
more than $150 million in earnings. However, its contributions declined 
significantly in 1994.

     Reflecting the volatility of financial markets during the year, some of 
the stocks in the portfolio declined in value. A more disturbing development, 
however, was a $10.1 million, or 21-cent-per-share write-off of one specific 
investment. The investment had been designed to protect the Company against 
fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility, but we believe the fund 
manager failed to follow the stated investment strategy and exposed the fund to 
rising interest rates.

     Investments and Corporate Services also includes our investment in Capital 
Re Corp., a leading U.S. reinsurer of municipal bonds and other financial 
guarantees. 

     While this firm primarily focuses on municipal bonds, it also reinsures 
non-municipal debt obligations and private mortgages. 
     Primary insurance companies buy reinsurance from Capital Re to guarantee 
the timely payment of principal and interest on investment-quality debt. Bonds 
reinsured by Capital Re automatically receive an upgrade to a AAA credit 
rating, which lowers the issuers' interest costs and provides an additional 
level of comfort to investors. Minnesota Power owns 21% of Capital Re and 
appoints two members of its board of directors.

     Minnesota Power also owns 80% of Lehigh Acquisition Corp., which has 
contributed substantially to our earnings in recent years.

     Its real estate properties include 8,100 undeveloped home sites and an 
additional 5,000 acres of unimproved property near and in the community of 
Lehigh Acres, which is about 15 miles east of Fort Myers, Fla.
     During the year, the community was enhanced by the opening of Lehigh 
Senior High School on a site largely donated by the company. A massive new Wal-
Mart Center, roughly three times the size of a typical Wal-Mart outlet, is 
under construction at a site near where Lehigh owns most of the remaining 
commercially zoned land. A new medical center has also opened, and Lehigh 
continues to recruit businesses for the community's industrial park.
     Lehigh sells properties to certified developers who build and sell well-
designed, affordable homes.
     Because Lehigh Acres is primarily an affordable first home and retirement 
community, growth is partly driven by the ability of retirees in the Midwest 
and Northeast to sell their existing homes. Rising economies in those areas 
should boost sales. Also, with the introduction of direct flights from Germany 
to Florida, Lehigh Acres is becoming a flourishing German community, complete 
with German restaurants and newspapers, and German-speaking customer service 
personnel.
     In 1994 Lehigh formalized procedures to begin constructing $5.2 million in 
water and wastewater facilities in Lehigh Acres using funds held in escrow. The 
funds are restricted for payment of such construction expenditures.  Based on 
revised procedures, which accelerated use of the funds, and plans to build the 
facilities over the next five years, Lehigh recognized approximately $4.5 
million of income in March 1994.  The Company's share of this income totaled 
$3.6 million.
     Lehigh, which contributed $10.2 million to corporate earnings in 1994, 
continues to be highly profitable for Minnesota Power. The plan is to sell the 
Lehigh property as opportunities arise. We anticipate the sales will be 
completed over the next five years.
     Income could receive a boost in 1995 from real estate-related tax benefits 
that came with Minnesota Power's purchase of Lehigh Corp. in 1991.  The 
benefits are recorded on Lehigh's books as $26.9 million of net deferred tax 
assets, offset by a reserve.  In keeping with established accounting 
principles, management reviews the assets quarterly; when it's deemed "more 
likely than not" that any portion of them will be realized, that portion will 
be recognized as income and the reserve reduced accordingly.  A portion of the 
assets may be recognized as income in 1995 as Lehigh reviews its business plan, 
including the timing and sale of its real estate holdings.

                                                                            19

     Lake Superior Paper Industries, jointly owned by subsidiaries of Pentair, 
Inc. and Minnesota Power, rebounded in fourth quarter 1994 from the weak prices 
of recent years. 
     Demand for its supercalendered groundwood paper is at a historical peak.  
Economic recovery in Europe aided LSPI's turnaround by providing a market for 
Finnish paper that had in recent years been shipped to the United States, 
depressing prices here.
     LSPI production for the year reached the record level of 241,000 tons, 
exceeding the mill's designed capacity. Productivity outpaced all competing 
supercalendered paper machines and resulted in the company's being named the 
world's most efficient SCA mill. The eight-year-old mill achieved this without 
investing additional capital. Breakthroughs came about as a result of empowered 
employees continually finding better, more efficient ways of getting things 
done.
     LSPI should be able to capitalize on the favorable paper market industry 
experts project to continue through at least 1996.  No new paper-making 
machines are scheduled to begin operations in that time period, and paper 
prices have increased by 14 percent since September 1994.  LSPI's goals are to 
continually improve productivity and to further reduce costs while providing 
high-quality customer service.
     When we decided to go into the joint venture that led to the start-up of 
LSPI, our goals were to create jobs, gain a new industrial customer for our 
electric utility business, launch a business with expansion potential, and earn 
a profit on our investment.  These goals have largely been achieved. The plant 
provides more than 300 jobs in the mill plus another 300 in logging and 
trucking. It requires 48 megawatts of power.
     Therefore, should a favorable opportunity arise through our joint venture 
partner's pursuit of a sale of its interest in LSPI, Minnesota Power would 
consider a sale of its interest.  Among factors that would influence us in 
favor of a sale would be the expectation that the new owner would ultimately 
expand the mill to its full potential.
     If LSPI is sold, the deal might also include the sale of Superior Recycled 
Fiber Industries, the pulp production plant that is adjacent to and operated by 
LSPI.
     SRFI produces recycled pulp from office scrap paper.  Commercial 
operations began at SRFI in November 1993.  It produced 84,000 tons of recycled 
pulp and contributed $906,000 to Minnesota Power earnings in 1994.

As expected, demand for recycled paper gathered further momentum during the 
year, and this in turn spurred intense production efforts at SRFI. 

     The $78 million plant produces high-quality recycled pulp for making 
printing papers, such as Potlatch Corporation's Quintessence RemarqueTM used in 
this report.
     SRFI's production rate at the end of 1994 exceeded the plant's designed 
capacity of 247 tons per day. The demand for recycled pulp will likely continue 
to rise as federal agency requirements for copying paper containing at least

Improving Customer Service Spawns a New Business

"Know thy customer" is good advice for any business, and technology is helping 
us do this. In 1989 we formed a team to evaluate potential new customer 
information computer programs for our utility businesses. None of the available 
options satisfied the standards set by our team, so they designed their own 
system. After four years of hard work, Minnesota Power's Customer Information 
System is not only on-line and performing well, it is being profitably licensed 
to other companies around the world. Pictured, from left:  Mike Cochran, Mary 
Schoenrock, JoLynn Nilson, Karla Strombeck, Russ Schumacher, and Diane Stuart

20% post-consumer waste take effect. SRFI's production is virtually sold out 
through 1995.
     SRFI's goal is to increase production further by eliminating bottlenecks 
and further improving efficiency.
     The chief challenge to further expansion of SRFI's business is the 
procurement of scrap paper. SRFI recycles nearly 10% of all office scrap paper 
collected in the United States. Although office sector sources are reasonably 
well developed, at least half of all scrap paper suitable for recycling is in 
private homes and no systematic means of recapturing it exists at this time.

Baffling the Bubbles

At the front end of LSPI's paper machine, there's a large cylindrical tank 
called a Deculator, where air bubbles are removed from water that carries pulp 
into the machine. Too many bubbles cause defects in the paper. Bubbles and 
turbulence problems had been increasing last year as LSPI sped up the machine. 
So LSPI's Dave Evens built a plastic replica of the Deculator to learn what was 
causing the excess turbulence, then designed modifying baffles to correct the 
problem. Now the machine runs faster, LSPI is saving $35,000 a year on 
defoaming additives, and the Finnish manufacturer of the Deculator is paying 
our mill an annual royalty on the improvement: U.S. Patent No. 5,236,475.

Comparing Financial Results from 1994, 1993 and 1992

     Income from the Company's investments declined $19.7 million in 1994 
primarily due to unfavorable conditions in the securities markets and a 21-
cent-per-share write-off of the Company's $10.1 million investment in Granite 
Partners, a limited partnership that filed for bankruptcy protection in 1994.  
Capital Re contributed positively all three years.  Investments and reinsurance 
income was $13.4 million lower in 1993 than in 1992, reflecting the adoption of 
new accounting principles, lower returns due to market conditions, and a $5.1 
million gain from the redemption by the issuer of a preferred stock investment 
in 1992.
     Investment income includes revenue of $31.7 million in 1994, $31 million 
in 1993, and $28.7 million in 1992 from operations and the sale of certain 
assets by Lehigh.
     In December 1992, $15.5 million of debt issued for the purchase of the 
real estate properties and operations was extinguished, and Lehigh assumed some 
contingent liabilities for which it had previously been indemnified by the 
previous owner. This transaction resulted in a non-taxable extraordinary gain 
to Lehigh of approximately $7.2 million. The Company's two-thirds share of this 
gain contributed 16 cents to earnings per share in 1992. 
     LSPI returned to profitability in 1994, earning $3.1 million pre-tax, 
compared with a pre-tax loss of $3.7 million in 1993 and pre-tax income of $3.4 
million in 1992.  LSPI had total sales of $152 million in 1994, $143 million in 
1993, and $150 million in 1992.  The mill shipped 241,000 tons of paper in 
1994, compared with 235,000 tons in 1993, and 220,000 tons in 1992. The 
Company's share of LSPI's pre-tax income was $1.5 million in 1994, compared 
with a $1.8 million pre-tax loss in 1993, and $1.7 million pre-tax income in 
1992.
     The Company has an 82.5% ownership interest in Reach All, a manufacturer 
of specialized truck-mounted lifting equipment used by utilities and 
governmental entities. The Company recognized Reach All pre-tax losses of $5.2 
million in 1994, $764,000 in 1993, and $3.1 million in 1992.

                                                                            21

OPERATIONS

     As detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows from 
operating activities in 1994 were affected by a number of factors 
representative of normal operations.
     The Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
(DRIP) was amended in January 1993 to allow the DRIP to meet its needs by 
purchasing original-issue common shares from the Company or buying common 
shares on the open market.  The DRIP has been buying on the open market since 
January 1994.
     In 1994 SSU sold $10.3 million of inter-local tax-exempt bonds to finance 
several water projects in Florida.  The bonds carry a variable interest rate 
currently at 3 1/2%. A portion of the proceeds from the Venice Gardens utility 
sale was used to redeem SSU's $15 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 15 1/2% 
Series due 1994.

     The Company estimates its capital requirements through 2000 will be met 
primarily with internally generated funds. 

     Working capital, if and when needed, generally is provided by the sale of 
commercial paper. In addition, securities investments can be liquidated to 
provide funds for reinvestment in existing businesses or acquisition of new 
businesses, and approximately 900,000 original-issue shares of common stock are 
available for issuance through the DRIP. If the ADESA transaction is approved 
by ADESA shareholders, cash from the liquidation of investments is expected to 
be used for the $167 million purchase.
     The Company is committed to guarantee a portion of LSPI's lease obligation 
to a maximum of $95 million and expects that short-term loans to LSPI will 
fluctuate during 1995 but may approximate the $35 million note receivable 
outstanding as of Dec. 31, 1994.
     Minnesota Power's electric utility first mortgage bonds and secured 
pollution control bonds are currently rated the following investment grades:  
A3 by Moody's Investor Service, A- by Standard & Poor's, and A by Duff & 
Phelps. The disclosure of these security ratings is not a recommendation to 
buy, sell or hold the Company's securities.

     In 1994 capital expenditures in our electric business consisted of routine 
plant improvements and upgrades. Our power supply and projected demand are in 
balance.

     No new power plants or major changes to existing plants are expected in 
the 1995-2009 period.  Future water utility capital expenditures include 
facility upgrades to meet environmental standards and new water and wastewater 
treatment facilities to accommodate customer growth.
     Consolidated capital expenditures in 1994 totaled $81 million, including 
$45 million for the electric utility operations, $28 million for the water 
utility operations, $3 mil-

The Value of Safety

Lehigh Acquisition Corporation, our Florida real estate affiliate, employs 
people in building trades, site preparation, road construction and other jobs 
considered high-risk by insurers. Determined to do something about accidents 
and high workers' compensation premiums, Lehigh's Joan Adler designed a safety 
incentive program that slashed accident rates, lowered premiums, and garnered a 
premium refund of $99,116 in 1994. Another refund is expected in '95.

lion for the pulp production plant, and $5 million for an affordable housing 
project. Internally generated funds were used for capital expenditures for the 
electric business. Water utility and affordable housing capital expenditures 
were funded through long-term financing and with inter-
nally generated funds. 
     Capital expenditures are expected to be $65 million in 1995 and total 
about $232 million for 1996 through 1999.  The 1995 amount includes $30 million 
for routine electric capital expenditures, $26 million for upgrades, water 
reuse projects and new water facilities, and $9 million for coal mining 
equipment and other capital expenditures. The Company expects to finance the 
majority of its capital expenditures with internally generated funds.

     We increased our common dividend in January 1995, the 25th consecutive 
annual increase.

     In 1994 the Company paid out 98% of its per-share earnings in dividends.  
Given the lack of major construction needs and the liquidity of our securities 
investment portfolio, we do not believe this high payout ratio to be 
detrimental in the short run.  
     Over the longer term, Minnesota Power's goal is to reduce dividend payout 
to 70% of earnings.  We expect to do this by increasing earnings rather than 
reducing dividends.  Our goal is for earnings per share to grow from their 1994 
level of $2.06 to a minimum of $3.25 by the year 2000. Our corporate strategic 
plan calls for about one-third of earnings to come from electric utility 
operations, another third from water utility operations, and the remainder from 
our Investments and Corporate Services area.

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the 
related consolidated statements of income, of retained earnings and of cash 
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
Minnesota Power and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these 
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting 
for income taxes and the employee stock ownership plan as discussed in Notes 13 
and 15, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.

     The consolidated financial statements and other financial information were 
prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and 
objectivity. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated utilities and 
necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and best 
estimates of management.
     To meet its responsibilities with respect to financial information, 
management maintains and enforces a system of internal accounting controls 
designed to provide assurance, on a cost effective basis, that transactions are 
carried out in accordance with management's authorizations and that assets are 
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. The system 
includes an organizational structure which provides an appropriate segregation 
of responsibilities, careful selection and training of personnel, written 
policies and procedures, and periodic reviews by the internal audit department. 
In addition, the Company has a personnel policy which requires all employees to 
maintain a high standard of ethical conduct. Management believes the system is 
effective and provides reasonable assurance that all transactions are properly 
recorded and have been executed in accordance with management's authorization. 
Management modifies and improves its system of internal accounting controls in 
response to changes in business conditions. The Company's internal audit staff 
is charged with the responsibility for determining compliance with Company 
procedures.
     Five directors of the Company, not members of management, serve as the 
Audit Committee. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, oversees 
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee 
meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent 
accountants to discuss auditing and financial matters and to assure that each 
is carrying out its responsibilities. The internal auditors and the independent 
accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee without management 
present.
     Price Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants, is engaged to express an 
opinion on the financial statements. Their audit is conducted in accordance 
with generally accepted auditing standards and includes a review of internal 
controls and a test of transactions to the extent necessary to allow them to 
report on the fairness of the operating results and financial condition of the 
Company.

2    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     System of Accounts. The accounting records of Minnesota Power are 
maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
     Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements 
include the accounts of the Company and all of its majority owned subsidiary 
companies. All material intercompany balances and transactions between 
subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The prior years 
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to present comparable 
information for all years.
     Plant and Depreciation. Plant is recorded at original cost. The cost of 
additions to plant and replacement of retirement units of property are 
capitalized. Maintenance costs and replacements of minor items of property are 
charged to expense as incurred. Costs of depreciable units of plant retired are 
eliminated from the plant accounts. Such costs plus removal expenses less 
salvage are charged to accumulated depreciation. Plant stated on the balance 
sheet includes construction work in progress and is net of accumulated 
depreciation. (See note 1.)
     Various pollution abatement facilities are leased from municipalities 
which have issued pollution control revenue bonds to finance the cost of the 
facilities. The cost of the facilities and the related debt obligation, which 
is guaranteed by the Company, has been recorded as electric plant and long-term 
debt, respectively.
     Depreciation of utility plant is computed using rates based on estimated 
useful lives of the various classes of property. Provisions for book 
depreciation of the average original cost of depreciable property approximated 
3% in 1994, 2.9% in 1993 and 2.7% in 1992. In 1995 the Company will begin 
recovering through rates approved by the MPUC in November 1994 approximately 
$1.3 million each year to pay for decommissioning of coal-fired power plants.
     Contributions in aid of construction (CIAC), recorded at estimated 
original cost, relate to water and wastewater plant contributed to the Company 
by developers and customers. CIAC is amortized on the straight-line method over 
the estimated life of the asset to which it relates when placed in service. 
Amortization of CIAC reduces depreciation expense.
     The Company's water plant includes plant held for future use which 
consists primarily of distribution and collection systems that will be placed 
in service as additional customers are connected to the systems. These systems 
are not depreciated until placed in service. The Company had $34.9 and $35.2 
million of plant held for future use at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993. CIAC funded 
approximately $21 million of plant held for future use in 1994 and 1993.
     Fuel, Material and Supplies. Fuel, materials and supplies are stated at 
the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.
     Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. The Company is subject to the 
provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of 
Regulation." The Company capitalizes as deferred regulatory charges incurred 
costs which are expected to be recovered in future utility rates. Deferred 
regulatory credits represent amounts expected to be credited to customers in 
rates. (See note 3.)
     Revenue and Income Recognition.
     Electric Utility Operations. The Company files for periodic rate revisions 
with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
The MPUC had regulatory authority over approximately 77% in 1994, 76% in 1993 
and 79% in 1992 of the Company's total electric utility operations revenue. 
Interim rates in Minnesota are placed into effect, subject to refund with 
interest, pending a final decision by the MPUC.
     Customer meters are read and bills are rendered on a cycle basis. Revenue 
is accrued for service provided but not yet billed. The service rates of the 
Company to all classes of customers include fuel adjustment clauses under which 
fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the base levels in rate 
schedules are billed or credited to customers. In addition, billings to retail 
electric customers reflect an annual billing adjustment mechanism applied 
monthly for recovery of CIP expenditures.
     During 1994, 1993 and 1992, revenue derived from one major customer was 
$60.2, $59.6 and $57.8 million, respectively. Revenue derived from another 
major customer was $45.3, $45 and $47 million, respectively.
     Water Utility Operations. The Company provides water service to 
communities in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Water 
rates are under the jurisdiction of various state and county regulatory 
authorities. Billings are rendered on a cycle basis. Revenue is accrued for 
water sold but not billed.
     Investments and Corporate Services. Investments and corporate services 
includes revenue from the sale of pulp and real estate, and income from 
securities investments. Pulp and real estate revenue is recognized on the 
accrual basis. Securities investments are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 
115, adopted on Dec. 31, 1993. (See note 4.)
     Income Taxes. Investment tax credits for utility property are amortized 
over the service life of the related property. Deferred taxes are provided on 
temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
which will have a future impact on taxable income.
     Unamortized Expense, Discount and Premium on Debt. Expense, discount and 
premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related 
issues.
     Statement of Cash Flows. The Company considers all investments purchased 
with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
     Noncash financing activities in 1994, 1993 and 1992 included $3.6, $3.7 
and $2.7 million, respectively, relating to debt service on the ESOP promissory 
note and the ESOP debt guaranteed by the Company. (See note 15.) Other noncash 
financing activities in 1993 included the issuance of 140,648 shares of common 
stock, with a market value at the time of issuance of approximately $4.9 
million, in exchange for an additional 13.4% ownership interest in Lehigh. 

                                                                            29

3    Regulatory Matters
     Electric Utility Rate Proceedings. In January 1994 the Company filed with 
the MPUC a request for a final annual rate increase from all retail electric 
customers of $34 million, or 11.8%, and a 12.5% return on equity. In August 
1994 the Company reduced its requested annual increase of $34 million to $27 
million for 1994 and $23 million for 1995 because of reductions in the 
projected cost of service and the addition of long-term contract commitments by 
a taconite customer. On Feb. 17, 1994, the MPUC voted to approve the Company's 
requested annual interim rate increase of $20 million, or 7%. This interim rate 
increase began on March 1, 1994, subject to refund with interest, and will 
continue until final rates are effective. 
     In November 1994, the MPUC granted the Company an increase in annual 
electric operating revenue of $19 million and an 11.6% return on equity. Rates 
for large industrial customers will increase less than 4%, while the rate for 
small businesses will increase 6.5%. The rate increase for residential 
customers will be phased in over three years: 13.5% beginning in 1995, 3.75% in 
January 1996 and another 3.75% in January 1997. In 1994 the Company collected 
$17.2 million of interim revenue subject to refund with interest. The Company 
has reserved $6.1 million of the interim revenue for anticipated refunds. Final 
rates are expected to be effective in the second quarter of 1995.
     In January 1994 the Company began recovering ongoing 1994 CIP expenditures 
and $8.2 million of deferred CIP expenditures incurred prior to Dec. 31, 1993, 
through an annual billing adjustment mechanism approved by the MPUC. Through 
the adjustment the Company is allowed to recover current and deferred CIP 
expenditures and a lost margin associated with power saved as a result of these 
programs. The adjustment is revised annually to reflect CIP expenditures that 
differ from the base level included in the rate schedules. The Company 
collected $7.8 million of CIP related revenue in 1994.
     Water Utility Rate Proceedings. In 1993 the FPSC and certain Florida 
counties approved final annual rate increases totaling $16 million of $21.2 
million requested by SSU. The FPSC ordered uniform rates for 90 water and 37 
wastewater systems in SSU's 1992 consolidated rate filing in Florida. Uniform 
rates are based on companywide costs rather than costs related to individual 
systems. In 1993 the FPSC initiated a separate investigation to determine if, 
as a matter of policy, uniform rates are appropriate for Florida water 
utilities. In August 1994 the FPSC reaffirmed the appropriateness of the 
uniform rate structure.
     Under Florida law, water and wastewater utilities may make an annual index 
filing designed to recover inflationary costs associated with operation and 
maintenance expenses. The law's intent is to provide inflationary relief to 
utilities, thus delaying or avoiding the costs associated with full rate case 
filings. Under another Florida law, water and wastewater utilities may make an 
annual pass-through filing to recover increased purchased water and wastewater 
treatment costs and property tax increases. The FPSC approved annual rate 
increases totaling $2.9 million of the $3 million requested in SSU's 1993 and 
1994 index filings and 1994 pass-through filings.
     Peabody Contract Buyout. In 1991 Minnesota Power and Peabody Coal Company 
(Peabody) executed an agreement to terminate the 1968 Coal Supply Contract 
between the parties (the Coal Contract) two years ahead of the scheduled 
termination date.
     In accordance with orders issued by the MPUC and the FERC, the Company 
used the retail and resale fuel adjustment clauses to pass through to electric 
customers the $35 million charge (plus a return on the funds used to make the 
payment) paid by the Company in December 1991 to terminate the Coal Contract. 
The early termination allowed the Company to purchase lower-priced coal on the 
open market and eliminated all of the Company's future responsibility relating 
to the Coal Contract. The impact of this ratemaking treatment on the 
consolidated income statement was the recognition of $3.9, $18.5, and $14.5 
million in 1994, 1993, and 1992 of the Coal Contract termination costs as fuel 
expense and the recovery of these costs in revenue through the fuel adjustment 
clauses.
     Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. Based on current rate treatment, 
the Company believes it will continue to recover from ratepayers all deferred 
regulatory charges.

4    Financial Instruments
     Securities Investments. The majority of the Company's securities 
investments are investment-grade stocks of other utility companies and are 
considered by the Company to be conservative investments. 
     The Company classifies its investments in equity and debt securities in 
three categories: Trading securities are those bought and held principally for 
near-term sale. They are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as part of 
current assets, with changes in fair value during the period included in 
earnings. Held-to-maturity securities are those the Company has the ability and 
intent to hold to maturity. They are recorded at amortized cost in investments 
and corporate services on the balance sheet. Available-for-sale securities are 
those that do not fit either of the previous two categories. They are recorded 
at fair value in investments and corporate services on the balance sheet. 
Changes in fair value during the period are recorded net of tax as a separate 
component of common stock equity. If the fair value of any available-for-sale 
or held-to-maturity securities declines below cost and the decline is 
considered other than temporary, the securities are written down to fair value 
and the losses charged to earnings. Realized gains and losses are computed on 
each specific investment sold.

</TABLE>
     Off-Balance-Sheet Risks. In portfolio strategies designed to reduce market 
risks, the Company sells common stock securities short and enters into short 
sales of treasury futures contracts.
     Selling common stock securities short is intended to reduce market price 
risks associated with holding common stock securities in the Company's trading 
securities portfolio. Transactions involving short sales of common stock are 
completed on average within 90 days from when the transactions were entered 
into. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from short sales of common stock 
securities are included in investment income.
     Treasury futures are used as a cross hedge to reduce interest rate risks 
associated with holding fixed dividend preferred stocks included in the 
Company's available-for-sale portfolio. Changes in market values of treasury 
futures are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
underlying hedged item. Gains and losses on treasury futures are deferred and 
recognized in investment income concurrently with gains and losses arising from 
the underlying hedged item. Generally, treasury futures contracts entered into 
have a maturity date of 90 days.
     In 1994 SSU entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement to 
lower its overall cost of borrowing. SSU agreed with a counterparty to 
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and 
floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional principal 
amount. The differential paid or received is accrued and recognized as 
adjustments to interest expense. The interest rate swap is subject to market 
risk as interest rates fluctuate.
     The notional amounts summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged 
and are not a measure of the Company's financial exposure. The amounts 
exchanged are calculated on the basis of these notional amounts and other terms 
which relate to the change in interest rates and securities prices. The Company 
continually evaluates the credit standing of counterparties and market 
conditions with respect to its off-balance-sheet financial instruments. The 
Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations or 
any material adverse impact to its financial position from these financial 
instruments.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying amount of cash and cash 
equivalents, trading securities, notes and other accounts receivable, and notes 
payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those 
instruments. The Company records its trading and available-for-sale securities 
at fair value based on quoted market prices. The fair values for all other 
financial instruments were based on quoted market prices for the same or

     The Company had bank lines of credit, which make short-term financing 
available through short-term bank loans and provide support for commercial 
paper, aggregating approximately $72 million at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993. At Dec. 
31, 1994 and 1993, the Company had issued commercial paper with face values of 
$54 and $20 million, respectively, supported by bank lines of credit and 
liquidity provided by the Company's securities portfolio. Certain lines of 
credit require payment of a 1/8 of 1% commitment fee and others require 
maintenance of 5% compensating balances. Interest rates on commercial paper and 
borrowings under the lines of credit range from 5.5% to 9.5% at Dec. 31, 1994, 
and 3.5% to 7.5% at Dec. 31, 1993. The weighted average interest rate on short-
term borrowings at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, was 5.7% and 3.5%. The total amount 
of compensating balances at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, was immaterial.

10   Square Butte
     Purchased Power Contract
     Under the terms of a 30-year contract with Square Butte that extends 
through 2007, the Company is purchasing 71% of the output from a mine-mouth, 
lignite-fired generating plant capable of generating up to 455 megawatts. This 
generating unit (Project) is located near Center, N.D. Reductions to about 49% 
of the output are provided for in the contract and, at the option of Square 
Butte, could begin after a five-year advance notice to the Company and continue 
for the remaining economic life of the Project. The Company has the option but 
not the obligation to continue to purchase 49% of the output after 2007.
     The Project is leased to Square Butte through Dec. 31, 2007, by certain 
banks and their affiliates which have beneficial ownership in the Project. 
Square Butte has options to renew the lease after 2007 for essentially the 
entire remaining economic life of the Project.
     The Company is obligated to pay Square Butte all Square Butte's leasing, 
operating and debt service costs (less any amounts collected from the sale of 
power or energy to others) that shall not have been paid by Square Butte when 
due. These costs include the price of lignite coal purchased by Square Butte 
under a cost-plus contract with BNI Coal. The Company's cost of power and 
energy purchased from Square Butte during 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $55.4, $56.5 
and $54.1 million, respectively. The leasing costs of Square Butte included in 
the cost of power delivered to the Company totaled $19.3 million in 1994, $19.7 
million in 1993 and $19.6 million in 1992, which included approximately $12, 
$12.5 and $12.9 million, respectively, of interest expense. The annual fixed 
lease obligations of the Company to Square Butte are $19.4 million from 1995 
through 1999. At Dec. 31, 1994, Square Butte had total debt outstanding of $219 
million. The Company's obligation is absolute and unconditional whether or not 
any power is actually delivered to the Company.
     The Company's payments to Square Butte for power and energy are approved 
as purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and the 
FERC.
     One principal reason the Company entered into the agreement with Square 
Butte was to obtain a power supply for large industrial customers. Present 
electric service contracts with these customers require payment of minimum 
monthly demand charges that cover most of the fixed costs associated with 
having capacity available to serve them. These contracts minimize the negative 
impact on earnings that could result from significant reductions in kilowatt-
hour sales to industrial customers. The minimum contract term for the large 
industrial customers is 10 years, with a four-year cancellation notice required 
for termination of the contract at or beyond the end of the 10th year. Under 
terms of existing contracts, the Company would collect approximately $90.5, 
$78.1, $75.5, $61.5 and $32.3 million under current rate levels for firm power 
during the years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, even if no 
power or energy were supplied to these customers after Dec. 31, 1994. However, 
following implementation of rate increases approved by the MPUC in November 
1994, and the anticipated MPUC approval of pending contract amendments, this 
minimum contract revenue is expected to increase $16 to $28 million in each 
year. The minimum contract provisions are expressed in megawatts of demand, and 
if rates change, the amounts the Company would collect under the contracts will 
change in proportion to the change in the demand rate.

11    Jointly Owned Electric Facility
     The Company owns 80% of Boswell Unit 4. While the Company operates the 
plant, certain decisions with respect to the operations of Boswell Unit 4 are 
subject to the oversight of a committee on which the Company and Wisconsin 
Public Power, Inc. SYSTEM (WPPI), the owner of the other 20% of Boswell Unit 4, 
have equal representation and voting rights. Each owner must provide its own 
financing and is obligated to pay its ownership share of operating costs. The 
Company's share of direct operating expenses of Boswell Unit 4 is included in 
the corresponding operating expense on the consolidated statement of income. 
The Company's 80% share of the original cost recorded in plant in service at 
Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, was $306 million. The corresponding provisions for 
accumulated depreciation were $119 and $111 million.

12   Sale of Water Plant Assets
     In December 1994 SSU sold all of the assets of its Venice Gardens water 
and wastewater utilities to Sarasota County in Florida, (the County) for $37.6 
million. The sale increased 1994 net income by $11.8 million and contributed 42 
cents to 1994 earnings per share. Water utility operations on the consolidated 
statement of income includes a pre-tax gain of $19.1 million from the sale. 
This sale was negotiated in anticipation of an eminent domain action by the 
County, which is purchasing private utilities in an effort to consolidate 
services.

     Adoption of SFAS 109. The Company adopted SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income 
Taxes" on a prospective basis in January 1993. The adoption of SFAS 109 changed 
the Company's method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method 
(Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11) to an asset and liability 
approach. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 109, the Company had deferred the tax 
effects of timing differences between income for financial reporting purposes 
and taxable income. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
(book value) and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.

     At Dec. 31, 1994, approximately $26.9 million of net deferred tax assets 
resulting from the original purchase of Lehigh are included on the Company's 
balance sheet. These assets are fully offset by the deferred asset valuation 
allowance because under the standards of SFAS 109 it is currently "more likely 
than not" that the value of these assets will not be realized. Management 
reviews the appropriateness of the valuation allowance quarterly. A reduction 
in the valuation allowance will result in recognition of income during the 
respective period.
     A provision has not been made for taxes on $19.1 million of undistributed 
earnings which were earned prior to 1993 by Capital Re, an investment accounted 
for under the equity method. Those earnings have been and are expected to 
continue to be reinvested. The Company estimates that $7.9 million of tax would 
be payable on the pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re if the Company 
should sell its investment. The Company has recognized the income tax impact on 
undistributed earnings of Capital Re earned since Jan. 1, 1993.

14   Pension Plans and Benefits
     Pension Plans. The Company's Minnesota, Wisconsin and Florida utility 
operations have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible 
employees. Pension benefits for employees in Minnesota and Wisconsin are fully 
vested after five years and are based on years of service and the highest 
average monthly compensation earned during four consecutive years within the 
last 15 years of employment. Employees in Florida are fully vested after five 
years of credited service, with benefits based on years of service and average 
earnings. Company policy is to fund accrued pension costs, including 
amortization of past service costs over 5 to 30 years. Part of pension cost is 
capitalized as a cost of plant construction.

Company's method of accounting for these costs requiring that they be 
recognized during employment. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 106, the Company 
recognized these costs as they were paid. Postretirement benefit costs 
recognized in 1992 under the Company's prior accounting method were $918,000.
     As of Dec. 31, 1994, the Company has deferred $12.8 million of 
postretirement benefit costs in excess of those allowed in existing rates. 
Pursuant to a rate order issued by the MPUC in November 1994, the Company will 
recover in electric rates, the retail portion ($11.7 million) of these deferred 
costs over a five year period beginning in 1995.

     Company policy is to fund the net periodic postretirement costs and the 
amortization of the costs deferred as the amounts are collected in rates. The 
Company will fund these benefits using Voluntary Employee Benefit Association 
(VEBA) trusts and an irrevocable grantor trust. The Company will make the 
maximum tax deductible contributions to the VEBAs. The remainder of the funds 
will be placed in the irrevocable grantor trust until the funds can be used to 
make tax deductible contributions to the VEBAs. The funds in the irrevocable 
grantor trust do not qualify as plan assets for purposes of SFAS 106.

     For measurement purposes, it was assumed per capita health care benefit 
costs would increase 13.3% in 1994 and that cost increases would thereafter 
decrease 1% each year until stabilizing at 5.3% in 2002. Accelerating the rate 
of assumed health care cost increases by 1% each year would raise the 1994 
transition obligation by $8.1 million and service and interest costs by a total 
of $1.4 million. The weighted average discount rate used in estimating 
accumulated postretirement benefit obligations was 8.25% for 1994 and 7% for 
1993. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.75% for 1994 
and 8.5% for 1993.

     Postemployment Benefits. The Company provides certain postemployment 
benefits to employees and their dependents during the time period following 
employment but before retirement. On Jan. 1, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS 
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which recognizes the 
estimated future cost of providing postemployment benefits on an accrual basis 
over the active service life of employees. Adoption of SFAS 112 resulted in a 
$2.2 million transition obligation. As a result of a rate order issued by the 
MPUC in November 1994, the Company deferred $1.6 million of the transition 
obligation which is being recovered in electric rates over a three-year period 
beginning in 1994. Prior to the 1994 adoption of SFAS 112, the Company 
recognized postemployment benefit expenses as they were paid.

15   Employee Stock Plans
     Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The Company has sponsored an ESOP since 
1975, amending it in 1989 and 1990 to establish two leveraged accounts.
     The 1989 leveraged ESOP account covers all non-union Minnesota and 
Wisconsin employees who work more than 1,000 hours per year and have one year 
of service. The ESOP used the proceeds from a $16.5 million, 15-year loan at 
9.125%, guaranteed by the Company, to purchase 633,489 shares of Minnesota 
Power common stock on the open market in early 1990. These shares fund employee 
benefits totaling not less than 2% of the participants' salaries.
     The 1990 leveraged ESOP account covers Minnesota and Wisconsin employees 
who participated in the non-leveraged ESOP plan prior to Aug. 4, 1989. The ESOP 
issued a $75 million promissory note at 10.25% with a term not to exceed 25 
years to the Company (Employer Loan) as consideration for 2.8 million shares of 
newly issued Minnesota Power common stock in November 1990. These shares are 
used to fund a benefit at least equal to the value of the following: (a) 
dividends on shares held in participants' 1990 leveraged ESOP accounts which 
are used to make loan payments, and (b) the tax savings generated from 
deducting all dividends paid on shares currently in the ESOP which were held by 
the plan on Aug. 4, 1989.
     The loans will be repaid with dividends received by the ESOP and with 
employer contributions. ESOP shares acquired with the loans were initially 
pledged as collateral for the loans. The ESOP shares are released from 
collateral and allocated to participants based on the portion of total debt 
service paid in the year.
     The Company accounts for the ESOP in accordance with the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position 93-6 
(SOP 93-6).
     The adoption in 1993 of SOP 93-6 decreased 1993 net income by $5.2 million 
and reduced the average number of shares outstanding for the 1993 EPS 
calculation by 3,114,067 shares. The net impact was a 6 cent increase in 1993 
earnings per share.
     Prior to 1993, the Company accounted for the ESOP in accordance with AICPA 
Statement of Position 76-3. ESOP loans, the note receivable and unallocated 
ESOP shares pledged as collateral for the loans were recorded in the financial 
statements the same as under SOP 93-6. All ESOP shares were treated as 
outstanding. The Company recognized interest income and interest expense on the 
Employer Loan to the ESOP in the financial statements. The Company calculated 
interest and compensation expense by first reducing interest expense and then 
compensation expense by the amount of dividends paid on leveraged shares 
charged to retained earnings. Compensation expense was computed using the cost 
basis to the ESOP of the shares. In 1992, the Company realized $3.2 million in 
tax benefits from the deduction of dividends paid on the unallocated shares 
used to make the debt service payments. These tax benefits were recorded 
directly to retained earnings and included in the EPS computation. Under SOP 
93-6, these tax benefits are included in income tax expense.

Shareholders and our electric utility customers may buy Company common stock by

the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, contact 
Shareholder Services. We belong to the National Association of Investors 
Corporation and participate in NAIC's Low Cost Investment Plan.

At your request, we'll automatically deposit dividends in your checking or 
savings account.  To sign up for this free service, request an authorization

(write "VOID" across its face) or a bank deposit slip showing the number of the

also if a stock certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen; we'll send you the 
necessary forms needed to replace it.  Replacing certificates takes time and 
involves some expense.
