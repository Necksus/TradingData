                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
                                    UNDER THE
                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995


         In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  (Reform  Act),  the  Company  is hereby  filing
cautionary  statements  identifying  important  factors  that  could  cause  the
Company's   actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or  on  behalf  of  the  Company  in  this  annual   report  on  Form  10-K,  in
presentations,  in response to  questions  or  otherwise.  Any  statements  that
express, or involve discussions as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always,  through the
use  of  words  or  phrases  such  as  "anticipates",   "estimates",  "expects",
"intends",   "plans",  "predicts",   "projects",  "will  likely  result",  "will
continue",  or similar  expressions)  are not statements of historical facts and
may be forward-looking.

         Forward-looking   statements   involve  estimates,   assumptions,   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond the  control  of the  Company  and may cause
actual  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in  forward-looking
statements:   (i)  prevailing  governmental  policies  and  regulatory  actions,
including  those of the FERC,  the MPUC,  the FPSC,  the NCUC, the SCPSC and the
PSCW,  with respect to allowed  rates of return,  industry  and rate  structure,
acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities,  operation,  and construction
of plant  facilities,  recovery of purchased  power,  and present or prospective
wholesale and retail  competition  (including but not limited to retail wheeling
and  transmission   costs);  (ii)  economic  and  geographic  factors  including
political and economic risks; (iii) changes in and compliance with environmental
and safety laws and policies;  (iv) weather  conditions;  (v) population  growth
rates and  demographic  patterns;  (vi)  competition  for retail  and  wholesale
customers;  (vii)  pricing and  transportation  of  commodities;  (viii)  market
demand,  including  structural  market  changes;  (ix)  changes  in tax rates or
policies  or  in  rates  of  inflation;  (x)  changes  in  project  costs;  (xi)
unanticipated  changes in  operating  expenses and capital  expenditures;  (xii)
capital  market  conditions;  (xiii)  competition  for  new  energy  development
opportunities;  and (xiv) legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or
criminal) and settlements  that influence the business and  profitability of the
Company.

         Any forward-looking statements speaks only as of the date on which such
statement  is made,  and the  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any
forward-looking  statement to reflect events or circumstances  after the date on
which such  statement  is made or to reflect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated
events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of such  factors,  nor can it assess the impact of any
such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

       Since 1983 Minnesota  Power has been  diversifying to reduce its reliance
on electricity  sales to Minnesota's  taconite  industry and to gain  additional
earnings  growth   potential.   Acquisitions   have  been  a  primary  means  of
diversification.  During 1996 the Company  purchased  the  remaining  20 percent
minority interest in ADESA, the third largest automobile auction business in the
United  States,   making  ADESA  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company.
Additionally,  the Company  acquired five auction  businesses to complement  and
expand its automotive  services segment. In April 1996 the Company acquired Palm
Coast real estate in Florida adding significantly to its inventory of commercial
and  residential  properties.  Water  services  expanded  during  1996  with the
acquisition  of ISI, a  predictive  maintenance  business  that serves the water
industry.  During 1997 the Company  plans to  complete  the  purchase of a small
water  utility in North  Carolina and continues to consider  other  acquisitions
that would  complement  its  businesses,  expand its services and  contribute to
earnings growth.

                               Electric Operations

       Electric   operations   generate,   transmit,   distribute   and   market
electricity.  In addition, electric operations include coal mining, engineering,
construction and maintenance services,  and economic development projects within
the Company's service area.

       -  Minnesota Power provides  electricity in a 26,000 square mile electric
          service  territory located in northeastern  Minnesota.  As of December
          31, 1996,  Minnesota Power was supplying  retail  electric  service to
          121,000 customers in 153 cities,  towns and communities,  and outlying
          rural areas.  The largest  city served is Duluth with a population  of
          85,000 based on the 1990 census. Wholesale electric service for resale
          is supplied to 13 municipal  distribution systems, one private utility
          and SWL&P.

          MPEX is an expansion of the Company's  inter-utility  marketing  group
          which has been a buyer and seller of capacity  and energy for 25 years
          in the wholesale  power market.  It was formally  established in early
          1996 as a new division of Minnesota  Power.  The customers of MPEX are
          other power  suppliers  in the Midwest and Canada.  MPEX  contracts to
          provide hourly energy scheduling and power trading services.

       -  Superior Water,  Light and Power Company sells electricity and natural
          gas, and  provides  water  service in  northwestern  Wisconsin.  As of
          December 31, 1996,  SWL&P served  14,000  electric  customers,  11,000
          natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers.

       -  Minnesota Power  Enterprises,  Inc., a subsidiary of Minnesota  Power,
          was created in 1996 to facilitate the development of the non-regulated
          services of  electric  operations.  Subsidiaries  of  Minnesota  Power
          Enterprises,  Inc.  include BNI Coal,  Synertec,  Rainy  River,  Upper
          Minnesota Properties, Inc. and Minnesota Power Services Group, Inc.

           - BNI Coal owns and  operates  a lignite  mine in North  Dakota.  Two
             electric generating cooperatives,  Minnkota Power and Square Butte,
             presently consume virtually all of BNI Coal's production of lignite
             coal under  coal  supply  agreements  extending  to 2027.  Under an
             agreement with Square Butte,  Minnesota  Power purchases 71 percent
             of the  output  from the  Square  Butte  unit  which is  capable of
             generating up to 470 MW. Minnkota Power has an option to extend its
             coal supply agreement to 2042. (See - Fuel and Note 17.)

           - Synertec  provides  project  development,   planning,  construction
             management and operating services to new and expanding businesses.

           - Rainy River  provides  engineering,  and operating and  maintenance
             services to new and existing generating facilities.

           - Upper Minnesota Properties, Inc. has invested in affordable housing
             projects located in the electric operations' service territory. The
             Company  is also an active  participant  in a variety  of  economic
             development  projects  throughout the electric  operations' service
             territory providing resources and expertise.

           - Minnesota Power Services Group,  Inc. includes the Electric Outlet,
             Inc.,  a retail  store  that  sells  life-style  changing  electric
             products,  and also  researches new products to be offered for sale
             or distribution.

Electric Sales

         The two major  industries in Minnesota  Power's  service  territory are
taconite  production,  and  paper  and wood  products  manufacturing.  These two
industries  contributed  about 43 percent of the  Company's  electric  operating
revenue in 1996 and 47 percent in 1995 and 1994.

         Over the last five years,  80 percent of the  domestic  ore consumed by
iron and steel plants in the United States has originated from plants within the
Company's Minnesota electric service territory.  Taconite,  an iron-bearing rock
of relatively low iron content which is abundantly available in Minnesota, is an
important  domestic  source of raw  material  for the steel  industry.  Taconite
processing   plants  use  large  quantities  of  electric  power  to  grind  the
ore-bearing  rock and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite
pellets. Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 46 million tons in 1996, 47
million tons in 1995 and 43 million  tons in 1994.  The Company  estimates  that
1997 Minnesota taconite production will be about 47 million tons. While taconite
production is expected to continue at annual  levels over 40 million  tons,  the
long-term  future of this  cyclical  industry is less  certain.  Production  may
decline gradually some time after the year 2005.

         Large Power Customer Contracts

         The Company  has Large  Power  Customer  contracts  with five  taconite
producers, four paper and wood products manufacturers and two pipeline companies
(Large Power Customers).  Large Power Customer  contracts require the Company to
have a certain  amount of capacity  available  at all times (Firm  Power).  Each
contract requires 10 MW or more of power and payment of a minimum monthly demand
charge  that  covers some of the fixed  costs  associated  with having  capacity
available  to serve the  customer,  including  a return on common  equity.  Such
contracts  minimize  the impact on earnings  that  otherwise  would  result from
significant reductions in kilowatthour sales to such customers. These contracts,
which are subject to MPUC approval, have a minimum four-year cancellation notice
required for termination.  The rates and corresponding  revenue  associated with
capacity and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through
the same regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Regulatory
Issues - Electric Rates.)

         As of March 14,  1997,  the minimum  annual  revenue the Company  would
collect under contracts with these Large Power  Customers,  assuming no electric
energy use by these customers,  is estimated to be $101.0,  $88.3,  $79.4, $69.2
and  $61.0  million  during  the  years  1997,   1998,   1999,  2000  and  2001,
respectively. The Company believes revenue from these Large Power Customers will
be substantially in excess of the minimum contract amounts.

     is available from that unit.

<F2> Under an  agreement  extending  through 2007 with Square  Butte,  Minnesota
     Power  purchases 71 percent of the output of a mine-mouth  generating  unit
     capable of  generating  up to 470 MW. The Square Butte  generating  unit is
     located near Center,  North Dakota and is one of two lignite-fired units at
     Minnkota Power's Milton R. Young Generating Station. Reductions to about 49
     percent of the output are provided  for in the contract  and, at the option
     of Square  Butte,  could  begin  after a  five-year  advance  notice to the
     Company.  The cost of the power and  energy  purchased  is a  proportionate
     share of Square Butte's fixed obligations and operating costs which are not
     incurred  unless  production  takes place.  The Company is responsible  for
     paying all costs and expenses of Square Butte (including leasing, operating
     and any debt  service  costs) if not paid by Square  Butte when due.  These
     obligations   and   responsibilities   of  the  Company  are  absolute  and
     unconditional,  whether  or not any  power  is  actually  delivered  to the
     Company. (See Note 17.)

Fuel
         The Company has experienced no difficulty in obtaining an adequate fuel
supply. The Company purchases  low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal from the Powder
River Basin coal field located in Montana and Wyoming to meet  substantially all
of its coal supply requirements. Coal consumption for electric generation at the
Company's Minnesota coal-fired generating stations in 1996 was about 4.3 million
tons. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had a coal inventory of about 425,000
tons.  During  1996,  the  Company  obtained  its coal  through  both  long- and
short-term agreements.  During 1996 the Company entered into two new coal supply
agreements.  A long-term agreement with Big Sky Coal Company enables the Company
to purchase up to 2.5 million tons of coal on an  annualized  basis from the Big
Sky Mine.  Additionally,  the Company  entered into a three year  agreement with
Decker Coal Company to purchase up to 1.0 million tons of coal on an  annualized
basis from the Decker  Mine.  The Company  also has a long-term  agreement  with
Spring  Creek Coal  Company to  purchase  up to 4.0  million  tons of coal on an
annualized  basis from the Spring  Creek Mine.  The Company  will obtain coal in
1997 under these  long-term  agreements  and the spot  market.  This mix of coal
supply options allows the Company to reduce market risk and to take advantage of
favorable  spot  market  prices.  The  Company is  exploring  future coal supply
options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal
will continue to be available.

         Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad transports the coal by unit train
from Montana or Wyoming to the Company's  generating  stations.  The Company and
Burlington  Northern  Santa Fe Railroad  have two  long-term  coal  freight-rate
contracts  that provide for coal  deliveries  through 2002 to Laskin and through
2003 to Boswell.  The Company also has a contract with the Duluth Missabe & Iron
Range  Railway  which is the final  destination  short-hauler  to  Laskin.  This
contract  provides for deliveries  through 2002. The delivered  price of coal is
subject to periodic adjustments in freight rates.

         The  generating  unit  operated  by Square  Butte,  which is capable of
generating  up to 470 MW, burns North Dakota  lignite that is being  supplied by
BNI Coal, a wholly owned  subsidiary of the Company,  pursuant to the terms of a
contract  expiring in 2027.  Square  Butte's cost of lignite  burned in 1996 was
approximately  60 cents per MBtu. The lignite acreage that has been dedicated to
Square Butte by BNI Coal is located on lands  essentially all of which are under
private  control  and  presently  leased by BNI  Coal.  This  lignite  supply is
sufficient to provide the fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating
unit.   Under  the  various   agreements  with  Square  Butte,  the  Company  is
unconditionally  obligated  to pay all costs not paid by Square  Butte when due.
These costs include the price of lignite  purchased  under a cost-plus  contract
from BNI Coal. (See Item 2. Properties and Note 17.) BNI Coal has experienced no
difficulty in supplying all of Square Butte's lignite requirements.

Regulatory Issues

         The Company and its  subsidiaries  are exempt from regulation under the
Public Utility Holding  Company Act of 1935,  except as to Section 9(a)(2) which
relates to acquisition of securities of public utility operations.

         The Company and its  subsidiaries  are subject to the  jurisdiction  of
various regulatory authorities.  The MPUC has regulatory authority over electric
operations' service area in Minnesota,  retail rates, retail services,  issuance
of securities and other matters. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of
hydroelectric  projects,  the establishment of rates and charges for the sale of
electricity  for  resale  and for  transmission  of  electricity  in  interstate
commerce,  and certain  accounting  and record keeping  practices.  The PSCW has
regulatory  authority  over the retail  sales of  electricity,  water and gas by
SWL&P.  The MPUC,  FERC and PSCW had regulatory  authority  over 69 percent,  13
percent, and 8 percent,  respectively,  of the Company's 1996 electric operating
revenue and income.

         Electric  Rates

         The Company has historically  designed its electric service rates based
on cost of service  studies  under  which  allocations  are made to the  various
classes of customers. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses
which  adjust  electric  service  rates  for  changes  in the  cost of fuel  and
purchased energy, and recovery of current and deferred CIP expenditures.

         The  Company's  Firm Power rate  schedules  are designed to recover the
fixed costs of providing Firm Power to Large Power Customers, including a return
on common equity. A Large Power Customer's  monthly demand charge  obligation in
any particular month is determined based upon the firm demand amount.  The rates
and  corresponding  revenue  associated  with capacity and energy provided under
these contracts are subject to change through the regulatory  process  governing
all  retail  electric  rates.  Contracts  with  ten of the  eleven  Large  Power
Customers  provide for deferral  without interest or diminishment of one-half of
demand charge obligations  incurred during the first three months of a strike or
illegal  walkout at a customer's  facilities,  with repayment  required over the
12-month period following resolution of the work stoppage. (See Electric Sales -
Large Power Customer Contracts.)

         The Company also has contracts  with large  industrial  and  commercial
customers  who have  monthly  demands  of more  than 2 MW but less than 10 MW of
capacity  (Large Light and Power  Customers).  The terms of these contracts vary
depending  upon the  customers'  demand for power and the cost of extending  the
Company's facilities to provide electric service.  Generally,  the contracts for
less than 3 MW have  one-year  terms and the  contracts  ranging from 3 to 10 MW
have initial  five-year  terms.  The Company's rate schedule for Large Light and
Power Customers is designed to minimize fluctuations in revenue and to recover a
significant portion of the fixed costs of providing service to such customers.

         The Company requires that all large industrial and commercial customers
under contract specify the date when power is first required, and thereafter the
customer is billed for at least the minimum power for which it contracted. These
conditions are part of all contracts  covering power to be supplied to new large
industrial and commercial  customers and to current contract  customers as their
contracts expire or are amended. All contracts provide that new rates which have
been  approved  by  appropriate   regulatory  authorities  will  be  substituted
immediately  for obsolete  rates,  without  regard to any unexpired  term of the
existing  contract.  All rate  schedules are subject to approval by  appropriate
regulatory authorities.

         Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

         The FERC has jurisdiction over the Company's wholesale electric service
resale customers and transmission service (wheeling) customers. In a filing with
the FERC on December 22, 1995, the Company requested an overall rate decrease of
$138,000 or 0.4 percent with an effective  date of January 1,  1996.  All of the
customers  affected by the rate change  submitted  written  consents to the rate
change and effective date. Minor  modifications to the rate request were made in
an amendment filed on January 16,  1996. On June 19, 1996, the FERC accepted the
proposed rates as filed.

         The Company has contracts  with 13 Minnesota  municipalities  receiving
full requirements resale service. One contract is for service through 2001 while
the other 12 are for service  through at least 2007.  The  contracts  limit rate
increases  (including  fuel costs) to about 2 percent  per year on a  cumulative
basis.  In 1996  the 13  municipal  customers  purchased  463,394  MWh  from the
Company.

         Two  municipalities  whose  requirements are only partially supplied by
the Company  have  contracts  with the Company  through  2000.  These  municipal
customers  signed  amendments  under which the Company  will  provide  exclusive
brokering service for the  municipalities'  purchases of economy energy and will
supply emergency,  scheduled outage and firm energy as required through 2000. In
1996 these two municipalities purchased 154,873 MWh from the Company. 

         A contract  between  Minnesota  Power and SWL&P  provides  for SWL&P to
purchase  its power from the  Company  through  at least  2010 and  limits  rate
increases  (including  fuel costs) to about 2 percent  per year on a  cumulative
basis. SWL&P purchased 562,969 MWh from the Company in 1996.

         The Company also has a contract  through 2004 to supply  electricity to
Dahlberg  Light and  Power  Company  (Dahlberg),  a  private  utility.  Dahlberg
purchased 86,099 MWh from the Company in 1996.

         The Company's  hydroelectric  facilities which are located in Minnesota
are  licensed  by the FERC.  In 1995 the FERC  issued  to the  Company a 30-year
license  for the St.  Louis  River  hydroelectric  project  (87.6 MW  generating
capability).  In 1996 the FERC  extended  the  license  term from 30 to 40 years
because  of certain  mandates  to  mitigate  environmental  consequences  of the
project.  On  May 11,  1995,  a final  application  to  relicense  the  Pillager
hydroelectric  project (1.5 MW generating  capability)  was filed with the FERC.
The  Company  expects  that the FERC  will  issue a new  license  in 1997.  (See
Environmental Matters - Water.)
         
         Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
        
         In  November  1994 the MPUC  issued an order  granting  the  Company an
overall  increase in annual electric  operating  revenue of $19 million,  or 6.4
percent,  with an 11.6 percent return on equity.  Effective June 1, 1995,  rates
for large industrial customers increased less than 4 percent, while the rate for
small  businesses  increased 6.5 percent.  The rate  increases  for  residential
customers were approved to be phased in over three years:  13.5 percent began in
June 1995,  3.75  percent in January  1996,  and another 3.75 percent in January
1997.
         Minnesota requires electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5 percent
of gross annual retail  electric  revenue on conservation  improvement  programs
(CIP) each year. In 1996,  1995 and 1994, the Company spent $14.4,  $14.2 and $8
million,  respectively,  on CIP and  expects  to spend a total  of $8.2  million
during 1997. The MPUC allows such conservation expenditures in excess of amounts
recovered  through  current rates to be  accumulated  in a deferred  account for
future recovery.

         Since January 1994 the Company has been recovering ongoing CIP spending
and $8.2  million  of CIP  spending  from  previous  years.  Through  a  billing
adjustment and retail base rates approved by the MPUC, the Company is allowed to
recover current and deferred CIP  expenditures  and the lost margins  associated
with  power  saved as a result of these  programs.  The  Company  collected  CIP
related revenue of $10.8 million in 1996 and 1995, and $7.8 million in 1994.

         Public Service Commission of Wisconsin

         SWL&P  anticipates  receiving  approval from the PSCW to expand its gas
service  territory  to serve one  additional  rural  community  adjacent  to its
existing service  territory.  This $1.6 million expansion project is expected to
be completed by the end of 1997.

Capital Expenditure Program

         Capital expenditures for electric operations totaled $38 million during
1996.  Internally generated funds and long-term bank financing were used to fund
these capital expenditures.

         The Company's  electric  generating  stations have the capacity to meet
customer  needs  through  2002  without  major  capacity   additions.   Electric
operations capital expenditures are expected to be $33 million in 1997 and total
approximately  $135 million during the period 1998 through 2001. The 1997 amount
is for  electric  system  component  replacement  and  upgrades.  The  Company's
estimates of such capital  expenditures and the sources of financing are subject
to continuing review and adjustment.

Competition

         The electric  utility  industry is changing at both the  wholesale  and
retail  levels.  The  enactment of the Energy  Policy Act of 1992 resulted in an
increase in the  competitive  forces that affect three of the four components of
the electric utility industry: generation, transmission and power marketing. The
fourth  component,  local  distribution,  is subject to state  regulation.  This
legislation has resulted in a more competitive market for electricity  generally
and particularly in wholesale markets. Wholesale deregulation is underway, while
retail  deregulation of the industry is being considered at both the federal and
state  levels,  and is  affecting  the way the Company  strategically  views the
future.  With  electric  rates among the lowest in the U.S.  and with  long-term
wholesale and large power retail contracts in place, Minnesota Power believes it
is well positioned to address competitive pressures.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

         Wholesale

         During 1996 the Company completed  functional  unbundling of operations
under the requirements of FERC's Order No. 888 Open Access  Transmission  Rules.
Order No. 888 requires public utilities to take  transmission  service for their
own  wholesale  transactions  under  the  same  terms  and  conditions  on which
transmission  service is  provided to third  parties.  The Company has filed its
open access transmission tariff with the FERC, and expects to receive final FERC
rate  approval in 1997.  The Company has also filed its "Code of Conduct"  under
FERC's Order No. 889 Open Access Same Time  Information  System and Standards of
Conduct to formalize the functional  separation of generation from  transmission
within the organization.  As a result,  the transmission  component of Minnesota
Power's  electric  utility  business  is well  organized  for,  and has begun to
operate under, these new federal regulatory requirements.

         Minnesota  Power's  newly formed MPEX division  currently  conducts the
power marketing  function.  FERC approval of Minnesota  Power's wholesale market
based  rates  enabled  MPEX to conduct a  wholesale  power and energy  marketing
business in 1996. During 1996 Minnesota Power also completed  compliance filings
under FERC's Open Access Transmission Rules to separately state the transmission
component of the Company's coordination sales agreements,  and is awaiting final
FERC  approvals.  MPEX continues to review new strategic  opportunities  for its
wholesale  marketing  operations  in light of the new Open  Access  Transmission
Rules enacted by FERC and of the new power and energy markets within MAPP.  (See
Item 2. Properties - Electric Operations.)

         Retail

         In 1995  the  MPUC  initiated  an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  in the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery  of  electric   service   continues  to  be  efficient   following  any
restructuring,  the MPUC adopted 15 principles to guide a deliberate and orderly
approach to developing  reasonable  restructuring  alternatives  that ensure the
fairness of a  competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January
1996  the  MPUC  established  a  competition  working  group  in  which  company
representatives  have participated in addressing issues related to wholesale and
retail  competition.  Minnesota Power has  implemented a key account  management
process and anticipates  continuing  negotiations  with its large industrial and
commercial customers to explore contractual options to lower energy costs. These
customers  continue  to  aggressively  seek  lower  energy  costs  and  consider
alternative suppliers in anticipation of deregulated retail markets.

         Legislation

         In 1997 Congress and the Minnesota legislature are expected to continue
to debate proposed legislation which, if enacted,  would promote customer choice
and a more competitive electric market. The Company is actively participating in
the  dialogue  and debate on these  issues in  various  forums,  principally  to
advocate  fairness  and  parity  for all power  and  energy  competitors  in any
deregulated  markets  that may be created by any new  legislation.  The  Company
cannot predict the timing or substance of any legislation which might ultimately
be  enacted.  However,  the  Company  continues  taking  steps to  maintain  its
competitive position as a low-cost supplier and maintain its long-term contracts
with large  industrial  customers.  The Company is also advocating  property tax
reform  before the Minnesota  legislature  in order to eliminate the taxation of
personal  property that results in an  inequitable  tax burden among current and
potential competitors in local markets.  Finally,  SWL&P is participating in the
electric  restructuring  investigation  before the PSCW,  which is advising  the
Wisconsin legislature on recommended restructuring in Wisconsin.

Franchises

         Minnesota Power holds  franchises to construct and maintain an electric
distribution and  transmission  system in 86 cities and towns located within its
electric service territory. SWL&P holds franchises in 15 cities and towns within
its service  territory.  The remaining  cities and towns served will not grant a
franchise or do not require a franchise to operate within their boundaries.

                                      -9-

Environmental Matters

         The Company's electric  operations are subject to regulation by various
federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality,
solid  wastes,  and other  environmental  matters.  The  Company  considers  its
electric  operations to be in substantial  compliance  with those  environmental
regulations  currently  applicable to its  operations and believes all necessary
permits to conduct  such  operations  have been  obtained.  The Company does not
currently  anticipate that its potential capital  expenditures for environmental
matters will be material.  However,  because  environmental laws and regulations
are  constantly   evolving,   the   character,   scope  and  ultimate  costs  of
environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

         Air

         The Federal  Clean Air Act  Amendments  of 1990 (Clean Air Act) require
that  specified  fossil-fueled  generating  plants  meet new sulfur  dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emission  standards  beginning January 1, 1995 (Phase I) and that
virtually all generating  plants meet more strict emission  standards  beginning
January 1, 2000 (Phase II). None of Minnesota Power's generating  facilities are
covered  by the Phase I  requirements  of the Clean Air Act.  However,  Phase II
requirements apply to the Company's Boswell,  Laskin and Hibbard plants, as well
as Square Butte.

         The Clean Air Act creates emission  allowances for sulfur dioxide based
on formulas  relating to the  permitted  1985  emissions  rate and a baseline of
average fossil fuel consumed in the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. Each allowance is
an authorization  to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide,  and each utility must have
sufficient   allowances  to  cover  its  annual  emissions.   Minnesota  Power's
generating  facilities  in  Minnesota  burn mainly  low-sulfur  western coal and
Square  Butte,  located  in  North  Dakota,  burns  lignite  coal.  All of these
facilities  are equipped with  pollution  control  equipment  such as scrubbers,
baghouses  or  electrostatic  precipitators.  Phase II sulfur  dioxide  emission
requirements are currently being met by Boswell Unit 4. Some moderate reductions
in emissions  may be necessary  for Boswell Units 1, 2 and 3, Laskin Units 1 and
2, and Square Butte to meet the Phase II sulfur dioxide  emission  requirements.
The Company  believes it is in a good position to comply with the sulfur dioxide
standards  without  extensive  modifications.  Any  required  reductions  at the
Minnesota  generating  facilities are expected to be achieved through the use of
lower  sulfur  coal.  Square  Butte  anticipates   meeting  its  sulfur  dioxide
requirements  through  increased  use of  existing  scrubbers  or by  purchasing
additional allowances.

         The EPA, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, has established  nitrogen oxide
limitations  for Phase II  generating  units.  To meet Phase II  nitrogen  oxide
limitations,  the Company  expects to install at its plants  low-nitrogen  oxide
burner   technology  by  the  year  2000.  The  total  cost  of  installing  the
low-nitrogen  oxide burner technology and associated  facilities for Boswell and
Laskin is currently  estimated to be $6 million.  Options for complying with the
nitrogen  oxide  limitations  at Square Butte are being studied at this time and
include operational changes, capital expenditures and seeking regulatory relief.
The EPA decided not to promulgate  nitrogen  oxide  limitations  for the type of
boilers at Hibbard.

         The Company is participating in a voluntary program (Climate Challenge)
with the U.S.  Department of Energy to identify  activities that the Company has
taken and  additional  measures  that the Company may  undertake  on a voluntary
basis  that  will  result  in  limitations,   reductions  or  sequestrations  of
greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. The Company has agreed to participate
in this voluntary  program  provided that such  participation is consistent with
the Company's  integrated  resource planning  process,  does not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's  competitive  position with respect to rates and
costs, and continues to be acceptable to the Company's regulators.  The costs to
Minnesota  Power  associated  with Climate  Challenge  participation  are minor,
reflecting program facilitation and voluntary reporting costs.

         Water

         The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA),  as amended by
the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987,  established  the
National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System (NPDES) permit program.  The
FWPCA requires that NPDES permits be obtained from the EPA (or, when  delegated,
from individual state pollution control agencies) for any wastewater  discharged
into  navigable  waters.  The Company has obtained all necessary  NPDES permits,
including  NPDES storm water permits for applicable  facilities,  to conduct its
electric operations.

         The Company holds from the FERC licenses  authorizing the ownership and
operation of seven  hydroelectric  generating  projects with a total  generating
capacity of 121 MW. In 1991 the Company submitted  applications for new licenses
for four of the  projects.  By  orders  issued  in 1993,  the FERC  granted  new
licenses with terms of 30 years each, expiring December 31, 2023, for the Little
Falls (4.7 MW), Sylvan (1.8 MW), and Prairie River (1.1 MW) projects.

         On July 13, 1995, the FERC issued to the Company a 30-year  license for
the St. Louis River  hydroelectric  project (87.6 MW), with an effective date of
July 1, 1995.  The Company filed a request for rehearing of the FERC's order for
the purpose of challenging certain terms and conditions of the license which, if
accepted by the Company,  would alter the Company's operation of the project. In
1996 the FERC  issued a new license in  response  to the  rehearing  request and
extended the license term from 30 to 40 years because of the anticipated  impact
of FERC's mandates to mitigate  environmental  consequences of the project.  The
FERC also  directed the Company to  negotiate  with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake
Superior  Chippewa a reasonable annual charge for the use of tribal lands within
the project. In June 1996 the Company filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit a petition for review of the 1996 license as issued
by the FERC.  Separate  petitions for review were also filed in June 1996 in the
same court by the U.S.  Department  of the  Interior and the Fond du Lac Band of
Lake Superior Chippewa, two intervenors in the licensing proceedings. The issues
to be resolved concern the terms and conditions of the license which will govern
the Company's  operation and maintenance of the project.  In July 1996 the court
consolidated  the three petitions for review.  In October 1996 the Company filed
with the court an unopposed motion for a procedural  schedule  pursuant to which
the  briefing  of the  issues  would be  completed  in May 1997.  The motion was
granted by the court;  however,  the briefing  schedule has been suspended while
the Company and the Fond du Lac Band  negotiate  the  reasonable  fee for use of
tribal  lands as mandated by the new license.  Both  parties  have  informed the
court that these  negotiations may resolve other disputed  issues,  and they are
obligated to report to the court periodically the status of these discussions.

         An  application  to relicense  the Pillager  project (1.5 MW) was filed
with  the  FERC  on  May  11,  1995.  The  FERC  will  perform  an  engineering,
environmental  and economic  analysis of that  application in order to determine
whether to issue a new license  for the  project.  The  current  license for the
project  expires  on  May  11,  1997.  FERC  scoping  meetings  to  discuss  any
environmental  and  operational  issues  related  to this  project  were held in
October  1996 with the resource  agencies and the public.  The FERC staff sought
input  related  to  any  water  quality,  fishery,  terrestrial,   cultural  and
recreation  issues  that the  agencies  and public have prior to  preparing  the
environmental  assessment for this project.  To date, no substantive issues have
been raised by the resource  agencies or the public in the license  process.  In
the event that the current  license should expire prior to the issuance of a new
license,  the FERC is required to issue an annual  license to the Company  under
the terms and  conditions  of the  existing  license  until the new  license  is
issued.

         The two remaining hydroelectric projects,  Blanchard (18 MW) and Winton
(4 MW) have FERC licenses  that expire in 2003.  The Company is currently in the
planning stages for the relicensing of these two facilities.

 Solid Waste

         The  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act of 1976  regulates  the
management and disposal of solid wastes.  As a result of this  legislation,  the
EPA has promulgated  various  hazardous waste rules.  The Company is required to
notify the EPA of hazardous  waste activity and routinely  submits the necessary
annual reports to the EPA.

         In response to EPA Region V's request for utilities to  participate  in
their Great Lakes Initiative by voluntarily  removing remaining  polychlorinated
biphenyl   (PCB)   inventories,   the  Company  is  scheduling   replacement  of
PCB-contaminated  oil  from  substation  equipment  by 1998 and  removal  of PCB
capacitors by 2004. The total cost is expected to be between $1.5 and $2 million
of which $300,000 was expended through December 31, 1996. The Company expects to
expend about $110,000 in 1997.

         Mining Control and Reclamation

         BNI Coal's mining operations are governed by the Federal Surface Mining
Control  and  Reclamation  Act of 1977.  This Act,  together  with the rules and
regulations  adopted  thereunder by the  Department  of the Interior,  Office of
Surface  Mining  Reclamation  and  Enforcement  (OSM),  governs the  approval or
disapproval of all mining permits on federally owned land and the actions of the
OSM in approving or disapproving  state regulatory  programs  regulating  mining
activities.  The North Dakota Reclamation of Strip Mined Lands Act and rules and
regulations  enacted  thereunder in 1969, as  subsequently  amended by the North
Dakota Mining and Reclamation Act and rules and regulations  enacted  thereunder
in 1977,  govern the  reclamation  of surface  mined lands and are  generally as
stringent or more stringent than the federal rules and  regulations.  Compliance
is monitored  by the North Dakota  Public  Service  Commission.  The federal and
state laws and  regulations  require a wide range of procedures  including water
management,  topsoil and subsoil segregation,  stockpiling and revegetation, and
the posting of performance bonds to assure  compliance.  In general,  these laws
and  regulations  require the reclaiming of mined lands to a level of usefulness
equal to or greater  than that  available  before  active  mining.  The  Company
considers  BNI Coal to be in  substantial  compliance  with those  environmental
regulations  currently  applicable to its  operations and believes all necessary
permits to conduct such operations have been obtained.

                                 Water Services

         Water  services  include  Florida  Water,  Heater and ISI, three wholly
owned  subsidiaries of the Company.  Water services have been upgrading existing
facilities,  building  new  facilities,  acquiring  new  systems  and  expanding
unregulated services.

         -   Florida Water,  formerly Southern States Utilities,  Inc., owns and
             operates  water and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  in Florida.
             Florida  Water is the  largest  investor  owned  water  supplier in
             Florida.  As of  December 31,  1996,  Florida Water served  120,000
             water customers and 54,000 wastewater treatment customers.

         -   Heater owns and operates  three  companies  which provide water and
             wastewater treatment services in North Carolina and South Carolina.
             As of  December 31,  1996,  these  companies  served  22,000  water
             customers and 1,000 wastewater treatment customers.

             During  1996  Heater  made a  strategic  decision to exit the South
             Carolina  water and  wastewater  utility  business.  In March  1996
             Heater of Seabrook,  Inc. (Seabrook),  a wholly owned subsidiary of
             Heater,  sold all of its water and wastewater utility assets to the
             Town of Seabrook Island, South Carolina for $5.9 million. This sale
             was negotiated in  anticipation  of an eminent domain action by the
             Town of Seabrook  Island,  South Carolina.  In December 1996 Heater
             sold its  Columbia,  South  Carolina  area  water  systems to South
             Carolina Water and Sewer,  L.L.C.  One service area remains and the
             pending sale is  anticipated  to be  finalized in 1997.  (See South
             Carolina Public Service Commission.)

             On  December  31,  1996,  Heater and the  shareholders  of LaGrange
             Waterworks  Corporation  (LaGrange),  a water utility serving 5,300
             customers near Fayetteville,  North Carolina, requested the NCUC to
             approve the transfer of LaGrange to Heater in a stock  transaction.
             The NCUC held hearings on February 19 and March 13,  1997. An order
             is expected in May 1997.

          -  Instrumentation  Services,  Inc.  provides  predictive  maintenance
             services to water utility companies and other industrial operations
             in North Carolina,  South Carolina,  Florida,  Georgia,  Tennessee,
             Virginia and Texas. The Company acquired ISI in 1996.

Regulatory Issues

         Florida Public Service Commission

         The following summarizes current rate proceedings in Florida.

         1995 Rate Case

         Florida Water requested an $18.1 million rate increase in June 1995. On
October 30,  1996,  the FPSC  issued its final  order in the Florida  Water rate
case. The final order  established  water and wastewater rates for all customers
of Florida Water regulated by the FPSC. The new rates, which became effective on
September  20,  1996,   resulted  in  an  annualized   increase  in  revenue  of
approximately $11.1 million. This increase included, and was not in addition to,
the $7.9  million  increase  in  annualized  revenue  granted as  interim  rates
effective on January 23, 1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate  structure  called
"capband," which replaces uniform rates. The new structure  combines the concept
of a "cap" on monthly bills at a certain  usage level for 85 of Florida  Water's
facilities that are more expensive to operate, with a "banding," or grouping, of
rates paid by customers served by the 56 less expensive facilities.  On November
1, 1996,  Florida Water filed with the Florida First  District  Court of Appeals
(Court of Appeals) an appeal of the FPSC's final order seeking  judicial  review
of issues relating to the amount of investment in utility facilities recoverable
in rates from current customers. Motions for reconsideration of the FPSC's final
order  were  denied  by the FPSC on March 19,  1997.  The  Company  is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.  Florida law provides  that the new rates be
implemented, subject to refund, while the order is under appeal.

                                      -13-

         1991 Rate Case Refund Order

         Responding to a Florida Supreme Court decision  addressing the issue of
retroactive  ratemaking with respect to another company,  in March 1996 the FPSC
voted to  reconsider  an October  1995 order  (Refund  Order)  which  would have
required Florida Water to refund about $13 million,  which includes interest, to
customers  who paid more since  October 1993 under uniform rates than they would
have paid under  stand-alone  rates.  Under the  Refund  Order,  the  collection
through a  surcharge  of the  $13 million  from  customers  who paid less  under
uniform  rates would not be  permitted.  The Refund Order was in response to the
Court of Appeals  reversal  in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order  which  imposed
uniform  rates  for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in  Florida.  With
"uniform  rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the same rates for
water and wastewater services. Uniform rates are an alternative to "stand-alone"
rates which are  calculated  based on the cost of serving each service area. The
FPSC  reconsidered the Refund Order, but upheld by a 3 to 2 vote its decision to
order refunds without  surcharges in August 1996.  Florida Water filed an appeal
of this  decision  with the  Court of  Appeals.  A  decision  on the  appeal  is
anticipated  by early 1998.  The Company  continues  to believe that it would be
improper  for the FPSC to  order a refund  to one  group  of  customers  without
permitting  recovery of a similar amount from the remaining  customers since the
Court of Appeals affirmed the Company's total revenue requirement for operations
in Florida. No provision for refund has been recorded.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.

         Florida Jurisdictional Issues

         In June  1995  the FPSC  issued  an order  assuming  jurisdiction  over
Florida Water facilities  statewide following an investigation of all of Florida
Water's  facilities.  Several counties in Florida appealed this FPSC decision to
the Court of Appeals.  In December  1996 the Court of Appeals  issued an opinion
reversing  the FPSC order.  On  December 26,  1996,  the FPSC filed a motion for
clarification and for rehearing with the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals
denied this motion on January 22, 1997. On February 14, 1997, the FPSC issued an
order which  requires  Florida  Water to charge  rates to  customers in Hernando
County based on a modified  stand-alone  rate structure.  The imposition of this
rate  structure  would  reduce  Florida  Water  revenue  by  $1.6 million  on  a
prospective annual basis. On February 28, 1997, Florida Water filed a motion for
reconsideration of this order. The Company anticipates that a ruling against the
Company on this appeal may encourage  other  counties to exercise their right to
regulate  the  rates  for  water  and  wastewater  facilities  located  in their
respective  counties.  In the event county  regulation  of water and  wastewater
rates prevails,  the Company anticipates that the regulatory process will become
significantly more complex and expensive.
         
         South Carolina Public Service Commission

         During 1994 and 1995 Heater was denied a rate  increase  from the SCPSC
for requests filed for Seabrook and Upstate Heater  Utilities,  Inc.  (Upstate).
Heater filed  appeals for both rate  increases and began  collecting  the higher
rates for water and  wastewater  services  at  Seabrook  under a surety  bond in
February 1995.  Rates under bond collected for Seabrook  amounted to $359,350 at
December 31,  1996.  In August  1996 the South  Carolina  Supreme  Court  upheld
Heater's  appeal and  remanded the case to the SCPSC.  Heater  continues to hold
these rates under bond pending a final decision from the SCPSC.  On February 21,
1997,  the SCPSC  issued an order  granting  Seabrook a $66,480  annual  revenue
increase. Heater filed a motion for reconsideration in March 1997.

         The appeal for Upstate  resulted  in a remand  from the South  Carolina
Court of Common Pleas (Court of Common  Pleas) and a revised order issued by the
SCPSC in September  1995.  Heater filed another  appeal with the Court of Common
Pleas,  and began collecting the higher rates for water service at Upstate under
a surety bond in January 1996.  Rates under bond  collected for Upstate  totaled
$65,861 at December 31,  1996. If this appeal is denied,  Heater must refund the
difference  between the amounts collected and the approved rates plus 12 percent
interest.  On  February  3,  1997,  the  Court of Common  Pleas  issued an order
vacating  the  September  1995  order and  remanded  the order to the  SCPSC.  A
decision by the SCPSC is expected in April 1997.

Capital Expenditure Program

         Capital  expenditures  for water services  totaled  $22 million  during
1996.  Expenditures were funded with the proceeds from long-term bonds issued by
Florida Water and  internally  generated  funds.  Capital  expenditures  for the
Company's  water  services  are  expected  to be  $21 million  in  1997  to meet
environmental  standards,  expand water and wastewater  treatment  facilities to
accommodate  customer growth,  and for water conservation  initiatives.  Capital
expenditures are expected to total  approximately  $85 million during the period
1998 through 2001.

Competition

         Water services provide water and wastewater services at regulated rates
within exclusive service territories granted by regulators.

Franchises

         Florida Water provides water and  wastewater  treatment  services in 22
counties regulated by the FPSC and holds franchises in three counties which have
retained authority to regulate such operations. (See Regulatory Issues - Florida
Public Service Commission.)

         All of the  water  and  wastewater  services  of  Heater  are under the
jurisdiction of the SCPSC and the NCUC. These  commissions  grant franchises for
Heater's service territory when the rates are authorized.

Environmental Matters

         The  Company's  water  services  are subject to  regulation  by various
federal,  state  and local  authorities  in the  areas of water  quality,  solid
wastes,  and  other  environmental  matters.  The  Company  considers  its water
services to  generally be in  compliance  with those  environmental  regulations
currently applicable to its operations and have the permits necessary to conduct
such  operations.  Except  as  noted  below,  the  Company  does  not  currently
anticipate that its potential  capital  expenditures for  environmental  matters
will be  material.  However,  because  environmental  laws and  regulations  are
constantly  evolving,  the character,  scope and ultimate costs of environmental
compliance cannot be estimated.

         In 1993 the EPA  notified  Florida  Water  of  alleged  exceedences  of
effluent  limitations  in NPDES  permit for Florida  Water's  facilities  in the
University Shores service area in Orange County,  Florida. During 1993 and 1994,
Florida Water  periodically  corresponded  and met with the EPA  concerning  the
alleged  exceedences  of the permit.  In  February  1994 the  University  Shores
facility was modified  such that  effluent was no longer  discharged  to surface
waters.  In 1992 the EPA  notified  Florida  Water  of  alleged  exceedences  of
effluent limitations in the NPDES permit for Florida Water's Seaboard wastewater
treatment   facility.   Between  1992  and  1994,   Florida  Water  periodically
corresponded and met with the EPA concerning alleged  exceedences of the permit.
In March 1994 the  facility was taken out of service and the  collection  system
was  interconnected  with the City of Tampa Utilities.  In February 1997 Florida
Water was notified by the United States  Department of Justice (DOJ) that unless
a settlement  can be promptly  achieved,  the DOJ, at the request of the EPA, is
prepared to bring a federal  court action  against  Florida  Water seeking civil
penalties for alleged  violations of effluent  limitations  in the NPDES permits
occurring at the  University  Shores and  Seaboard  wastewater  facilities  from
February 1992 through March 1994.  For purposes of settlement  discussions,  the
DOJ proposed a penalty totaling $3.25 million. Florida Water submitted a counter
settlement  offer of  $141,000  to the DOJ on March 26,  1997.  A  meeting  is
scheduled on April 4, 1997, with the DOJ to discuss settlement  options.  If the
DOJ pursues  litigation,  it is possible  that the claim  against  Florida Water
could  substantially  exceed  $3.25 million.  If a reasonable  resolution is not
reached,  Florida  Water  intends to  vigorously  contest  any  action  which is
initiated by the DOJ. The Company is currently unable to predict the outcome of
these matters.

<PAGE>

         In  September  1993 the EPA issued an  Administrative  Order to Florida
Water regarding operations of Florida Water's facilities in the Woodmere service
area in Duval County,  Florida (Woodmere  facilities).  The EPA required Florida
Water to perform a Toxicity Reduction Evaluation (TRE) to determine the cause of
the toxicity problems with the wastewater effluent. In March 1996 the EPA closed
the  Administrative  Order and  delegated  enforcement  authority to the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection.

         In 1996 water services  invested  approximately  $10.2 million of a $22
million  annual  capital  expenditure  budget (or  approximately  46 percent) in
facilities necessary to comply with environmental requirements.  In 1997 Florida
Water expects that  approximately $7.5 million of the $21 million annual capital
expenditure  budget (or  approximately  36 percent)  will be necessary to comply
with environmental requirements.


                               Automotive Services

         Automotive services include ADESA's auction facilities, AFC, which is a
finance company,  and an auto transport company. The Company acquired 80 percent
of ADESA on July 1, 1995. On January 31,  1996, the Company provided  additional
capital in exchange for an additional 3 percent of ADESA.  On  August 21,  1996,
the Company  acquired the remaining 17 percent  interest of ADESA from the ADESA
management shareholders.

         -   ADESA is a wholly owned  subsidiary of the Company and is the third
             largest  automobile  auction business in the United States.  ADESA,
             headquartered  in  Indianapolis,  Indiana,  owns  and  operates  24
             automobile  auction  facilities  in the  United  States  and Canada
             through  which used cars and other  vehicles are sold to franchised
             automobile  dealers  and  licensed  used car  dealers.  Sellers  at
             ADESA's auctions  include domestic and foreign auto  manufacturers,
             car dealers,  fleet/lease  companies,  banks and finance companies.
             ADESA   opened  new  auto   auctions  in   Manville,   New  Jersey;
             Jacksonville,  Florida and Moncton, New Brunswick,  Canada in 1996.
             ADESA also acquired auction businesses in Houston,  San Antonio and
             Dallas,  Texas;  Portage,  Wisconsin and  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania
             during 1996.

         -   Automotive Finance  Corporation  provides  inventory  financing for
             wholesale and retail automobile  dealers who purchase vehicles from
             ADESA auctions, independent auctions as well as auction chains. AFC
             is  headquartered in  Indianapolis,  Indiana,  and has over 40 loan
             production  offices  which are located at most ADESA  auctions,  as
             well as several  independently owned auto auctions.  AFC expects to
             expand in 1997.

         -   ADESA Auto Transport,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ADESA, is
             one  of  the  nation's  largest  independent  automobile  transport
             carriers with about 90 transport  vehicles.  ADESA Auto  Transport,
             Inc.  offers  customers  pick up and delivery,  four  strategically
             located   transportation   hubs  and  an   on-site   transportation
             representative at every ADESA auction.  It hauls vehicles for major
             customers  including  GE  Capital,  Nissan,  Ford Motor  Credit and
             General Motors  Acceptance Corp. During 1996 over 100,000 cars were
             transported within the United States by ADESA.

Capital Expenditure Program

         Capital   expenditures   for   automobile   auction  site   relocation,
development and facility  improvements were $41 million during 1996.  Greenfield
projects at  Manville,  New Jersey;  Jacksonville,  Florida;  and  Moncton,  New
Brunswick,   Canada  and  relocation  projects  in  Indianapolis,   Indiana  and
Cincinnati, Ohio began operations in 1996. In February 1997 ADESA consolidated a
small  auction  facility in  Concord,  Massachusetts  with its Boston  facility.
Capital  expenditures  for the  automobile  auction  business are expected to be
$7 million in 1997 and to total approximately $40 million during the period 1998
through 2001. Capital expenditures in 1997 are for on-going improvements and new
information systems at existing automobile auction sites.

Competition

         Within the automobile auction industry,  ADESA's  competition  includes
independently  owned  auctions  as well as major  chains and  associations  with
auctions in  geographic  proximity.  ADESA  competes  with other  auctions for a
supply  of  automobiles  to be  sold  on  consignment  for  automobile  dealers,
financial  institutions  and other sellers.  ADESA also competes for a supply of
rental repurchase vehicles from automobile  manufacturers for auction at factory
sales.  The  automobile  manufacturers  often  choose  between  auctions  across
multi-state areas in distributing rental repurchase vehicles. ADESA competes for
these sellers of  automobiles by attempting to attract a large number of dealers
to purchase vehicles,  which ensures  competitive prices and supports the volume
of vehicles  auctioned,  and by  providing  a full range of  services  including
reconditioning  services  which prepare  automobiles  for auction,  transporting
automobiles  and the prompt  processing  of sale  transactions.  Another  factor
affecting  the  industry,  the impact of which is yet to be  determined,  is the
entrance of the "superstore",  large used car dealerships,  that have emerged in
densely populated markets.

         AFC is well positioned as a provider of floorplan financing services to
the used vehicle industry.  AFC's competition  includes other specialty lenders,
as well as banks and other  financial  institutions.  AFC  competes  with  other
floorplan  providers and strives to  distinguish  itself based upon ease of use,
quality  of service  and  price.  A key  component  of AFC's  program is on-site
personnel to assist automobile dealers with their financing needs.

         Auto auction sales for the industry are expected to rise at a rate of 6
percent to 8 percent annually.  With the increased popularity of leasing and the
high  cost of new  cars,  the same  cars may come to  auction  more  than  once.
Automotive  services  expect to  participate in this  industry's  growth through
selective acquisitions and expanded services.

Environmental Matters

         The Company's  automotive services business is subject to regulation by
various federal,  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water
quality,  solid wastes, and other environmental  matters.  The Company considers
operations  of  this  business  to  be  in  substantial  compliance  with  those
environmental  regulations  currently  applicable to its operations and believes
all necessary permits to conduct such operations have been obtained. The Company
does not  currently  anticipate  that its  potential  capital  expenditures  for
environmental matters will be material.  However, because environmental laws and
regulations are constantly evolving, the character,  scope and ultimate costs of
environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

                                   Investments

         The  investments  segment  is  comprised  of  real  estate  operations,
financial guaranty reinsurance and a portfolio of securities.

         -   Real Estate  Operations.  The Company owns 80 percent of Lehigh,  a
             Florida  real estate  company.  Lehigh owns 4,000 acres of land and
             approximately 8,000 home sites near Fort Myers, Florida, 1,100 home
             sites in Citrus  County,  Florida,  and 3,000 home sites and 13,000
             acres of residential, commercial and industrial land at Palm Coast,
             Florida.  The Palm  Coast  properties  and  $18 million  receivable
             portfolio were purchased in April 1996. The real estate strategy is
             to acquire large residential  community properties at low cost, add
             value, and sell them at going market prices.

         -   Reinsurance.  Minnesota Power has a 21 percent equity investment in
             Capital  Re.  Capital Re  is a  Delaware  holding  company  engaged
             primarily in financial and mortgage  guaranty  reinsurance  through
             its wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  Capital  Reinsurance  Company and
             Capital Mortgage Reinsurance  Company.  Capital Reinsurance Company
             is  a  reinsurer  of   financial   guarantees   of  municipal   and
             non-municipal  debt  obligations.   Capital  Mortgage   Reinsurance
             Company is a reinsurer of residential  mortgage guaranty insurance.
             The Company's equity investment in Capital Re at December 31, 1996,
             was $102 million.

         -   Securities   Portfolio.   Minnesota   Power  manages  a  securities
             portfolio  which is  intended  to  provide  earnings  and cash flow
             contributions   and  is  available  for  reinvestment  in  existing
             businesses,  acquisitions and other corporate purposes. The Company
             plans to continue to concentrate in market neutral  strategies that
             are  designed  to provide  stable and  acceptable  returns  without
             sacrificing needed liquidity. Returns will continue to be partially
             dependent on general market  conditions.  As of December 31,  1996,
             the  Company  had  approximately   $155 million   invested  in  the
             securities portfolio.

Environmental Matters

         Certain businesses  included in the Company's  investments  segment are
subject to regulation by various  federal,  state and local  authorities  in the
areas of air quality,  water  quality,  solid  wastes,  and other  environmental
matters. The Company considers these businesses to be in substantial  compliance
with those environmental  regulations currently applicable to its operations and
believes all necessary  permits to conduct such  operations  have been obtained.
The  Company  does  not  currently   anticipate   that  its  potential   capital
expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be  material.  However,  because
environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the character, scope
and ultimate costs of environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

         The Company has electric  transmission  and  distribution  lines of 500
kilovolts (kV) (7.8 miles),  230 kV (606.4 miles),  161 kV (42.9 miles),  138 kV
(5.8 miles),  115 kV (1,257.3 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,114.1  miles).  The
Company  owns and  operates  178  substations  with a total  capacity of 8,539.2
megavoltamperes.  Some of the transmission and distribution  lines  interconnect
with other utilities.

         The  Company  owns and has a  substantial  investment  in  offices  and
service buildings,  area headquarters,  an energy control center,  repair shops,
motor  vehicles,   construction   equipment  and  tools,  office  furniture  and
equipment,  and leases offices and storerooms in various  localities  within the
Company's service territory.  It also owns miscellaneous  parcels of real estate
not presently used in electric operations.

         Substantially  all of the  electric  plant of the Company is subject to
the lien of its Mortgage and Deed of Trust which  secures first  mortgage  bonds
issued by the Company.  The Company's  properties  are held by it in fee and are
free from other encumbrances,  subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of
such a nature as to  substantially  impair the usefulness to the Company of such
properties. Other property, including certain offices and equipment, is utilized
under  leases.  In general,  some of the electric  lines are located on land not
owned in fee,  but are covered by  necessary  consents  of various  governmental
authorities or by appropriate  rights obtained from owners of private  property.
These  consents  and rights are deemed  adequate  for the purposes for which the

Item 5.  Market  for the  Registrant's  Common  Equity and  Related  Stockholder
Matters.

         The Company has paid dividends without interruption on its common stock
since 1948. A quarterly  dividend of $.51 per share on the common stock was paid
on March 1, 1997,  to the holders of record on February 14, 1997.  The Company's
common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Dividends paid per share
and the high and low  prices  for the  Company's  common  stock for the  periods
indicated  as reported  by The Wall Street  Journal,  Midwest  Edition,  were as
follows:

                                                              Dividends
                                  Price Range              Paid Per Share
                                  -----------              --------------
         Quarter               High        Low           Quarterly     Annual
         -------               ----        ---           ---------     ------  

   1996  -   First          $ 29 3/4     $ 26 1/8         $ .51
         -   Second           29           26               .51
         -   Third            28 3/4       26               .51
         -   Fourth           28 7/8       26 3/8           .51         $2.04

   1995  -   First          $ 26 3/8     $ 24 1/4         $ .51
         -   Second           28           25 1/4           .51
         -   Third            28 1/8       26 3/8           .51
         -   Fourth           29 1/4       27 1/2           .51         $2.04

         The amount  and timing of  dividends  payable on the  Company's  common
stock are within the sole  discretion  of the Company's  Board of Directors.  In
1996 the Company  paid out 90 percent of its per share  earnings  in  dividends.
Over the longer term, the Company's goal is to reduce dividend payout to between
75  percent  and 80  percent  of per  share  earnings.  This is  expected  to be
accomplished by increasing earnings rather than reducing dividends.

         The Company's  Articles of Incorporation and Mortgage and Deed of Trust
contain provisions which under certain  circumstances would restrict the payment
of common stock  dividends.  As of December 31, 1996, no retained  earnings were
restricted  as a result  of these  provisions.  At March  1,  1997,  there  were
approximately 24,000 common stock shareholders of record.

To the Board of Directors
   of Minnesota Power

         Our audits of the consolidated  financial statements referred to in our
report dated January 27, 1997  appearing on page 23 of the 1996 Annual Report to
Shareholders  of  Minnesota  Power  (which  report  and  consolidated  financial
statements  are  incorporated  by reference in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K)
also included an audit of the Financial  Statement Schedule listed in Item 14(a)

fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

the  Company  may,  but shall not be  obligated  to,  fix a record  date for the
purpose of determining the holders of bonds of the Twenty-fifth  Series entitled

their successors in said trust under the Mortgage as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.

                Amendment to the Third Supplemental Indenture and
                      Terms of the Fourth Series of Bonds.

         SECTION  1.  Effective  upon  the  date  of  this  Sixth   Supplemental
Indenture,  the Third  Supplemental  Indenture and the terms of the Bonds of the
Fourth Series shall be amended as follows:

         (a) The Bonds of the Fourth Series shall bear interest (computed on the
basis of a 360 day year--30-day month) at the rate of (a) six and ten hundredths
per centum (6.10%) per annum at any time other than during the  continuance of a
Payment  Default and (b) eight and ten  hundredths  per centum (8.10%) per annum
during the continuance of any Payment Default, payable semi-annually on January
1 and July 1 of each  year,  commencing  July 1,  1994,  except that any overdue
payment (including any overdue prepayment) of principal,  any overdue payment of
any premium and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under
applicable  law,  any  overdue  installment  of  interest  shall  bear  interest
(computed on the basis of a 360-day year--30-day month), payable semiannually as
aforesaid (or, at the option of the holder of the Bonds,  on demand),  at a rate
per annum from time to time equal to the greater of (i) eight and ten hundredths
per centum  (8.10%) or (ii) the rate of interest  publicly  announced  by Morgan
Guaranty  Trust  Company  of New York  from time to time in New York City as its
prime rate.  The rate of interest to be borne by the Bonds of the Fourth  Series
prior  to the  date of this  Sixth  Supplemental  Indenture  shall  be the  rate
provided by Section 1 of Article I of the Third Supplemental  Indenture prior to
the amendments thereto made by this Sixth Supplemental Indenture.  The principal
of, and the premium, if any, and the interest on, the Bonds of the Fourth Series
shall be payable in such coin or currency of the United  States of America as at
the time of payment shall be legal tender for public and private  debts,  at the
office or agency of the Company in the Borough of  Manhattan,  City of New York,
or the office of the Company in Superior, Wisconsin.

         (b) The Bonds of the Fourth  Series may be redeemed  prior to maturity,
in whole at any time or in part (in multiples of $500,000) from time to time, at
the option of the Company,  or by the  application  (either at the option of the
Company or pursuant to the requirements of the Mortgage) of cash delivered to or
deposited with the Corporate  Trustee  pursuant to the provisions of Section 39,
Section 61,  Section 64 or Section 118 of the  Mortgage or with the  Proceeds of
Released Property, in any such case at 100% of the principal amount of the bonds
being redeemed plus interest accrued

                                   8
<PAGE>


thereon to the date of  redemption,  together  with a premium equal to the Yield
Maintenance  Amount, if any, with respect to the bonds being redeemed.  Any Bond
of the Fourth Series redeemed pursuant to this paragraph may not be delivered to
the  Corporate  Trustee  in full or partial  satisfaction  of the  sinking  fund
requirement contained in Section 2 of the Third Supplemental Indenture and shall
not reduce the amount of the Bonds of the Fourth Series to be redeemed  pursuant
to such Section 2.

         Notice of any  redemption  of the Bonds of the Fourth  Series  shall be
given  by  mail,  postage  prepaid,  at  least  30  days  prior  to the  date of
redemption,  to the  registered  owners of all Bonds to be so  redeemed at their
respective  addresses  appearing on the books maintained by the Company pursuant
to Section 13 of the  Mortgage.  Any notice  which is mailed as herein  provided
shall be conclusively  presumed to have been properly and sufficiently  given on
the date of such  mailing,  whether or not the  registered  owner  receives  the
notice.  In any case,  failure  to give  notice by mail,  or any  defect in such
notice,  to the registered owner of any Bond of the Fourth Series designated for
redemption in whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the  proceedings
for the redemption of any other Bond of the Fourth Series.

         The provisions of this clause (b) shall apply in lieu of the provisions
of  subdivision  (I)  of  Section  1 of  Article  I of  the  Third  Supplemental
Indenture,  which subdivision (I) is hereby deleted in its entirety, and in lieu
of the  provisions  of  subdivision  (II) of Section 1 of Article I of the Third
Supplemental  Indenture  insofar as such  provisions  of such  subdivision  (II)
relate to any  redemption  of the Bonds of the Fourth Series by  application  of
cash  delivered  to or  deposited  with the  Corporate  Trustee  pursuant to the
provisions of Section 39 or Section 64 of the Mortgage, which provisions of such
subdivision (II) are hereby deleted in their entirety.

         (c)  Subdivision   (II)  of  Section  1  of  Article  I  of  the  Third
Supplemental  Indenture is hereby further  amended by amending the first proviso
thereof,  in lines nine  through  sixteen  thereof,  in its  entirety to read as
follows:

         "provided,  however,  that in the case of application of cash
         delivered to the Corporate Trustee pursuant to the provisions
         of Section 2 hereof,  If the date  fixed for such  redemption
         shall be prior to  January  1 of the  calendar  year in which
         such  delivery of cash shall become due under the  provisions
         of Section 2 hereof,  they shall be  redeemed  in  accordance
         with the  provisions of clause (b) of the Sixth  Supplemental
         Indenture at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
         the bonds being redeemed plus interest accrued thereon to the
         date of  redemption  together  with a  premium  equal  to the
         Yield-

                                   9
<PAGE>
         Maintenance  Amount,  if any, with respect to the bonds being
         redeemed."

         (d) All partial redemptions of Bonds of the Fourth Series shall be made
ratably  among  all  registered  owners  thereof  in the  proportions  which the
principal  amount  of the  Bonds  held by each  registered  owner  bears  to the
aggregate  principal amount of all Bonds of the Fourth Series then  outstanding,
computed to the nearest $1,000 principal amount of the Bonds.

         (e) In the event that the  principal  amount of the Bonds of the Fourth
Series is declared due and payable upon the  occurrence  of a Default or becomes
due and payable pursuant to Section 73 of the Mortgage,  there shall then become
due and payable,  together with the principal  amount of the Bonds of the Fourth
Series and interest accrued thereon,  a premium equal to the amount of the Yield
Maintenance  Amount  which would have been payable with respect to such Bonds of
the  Fourth  Series,  if they had been  redeemed  at the  option of the  Company
pursuant to Section 1 in this Sixth Supplemental  Indenture on the date on which
the Bonds of the  Fourth  Series  became  due and  payable;  provided  that such
premium, if any, with respect to the Bonds of the Fourth Series shall become due
and payable only if such  Default is, or such sale is made  following a Default,
other than one specified in any of clauses (ix),  (x) and (xi) of the definition
of the term "Event of Default" contained in this Sixth Supplemental Indenture or
subsections (e) or (f) of Section 65 of the Mortgage.

         SECTION  2.  Except to the  extent  expressly  set forth in this  Sixth
Supplemental  Indenture,  the Third Supplemental  Indenture and the terms of the
Bonds, as provided in the Third Supplementa1 Indenture, remain unchanged.

unless a Responsible  Officer assigned to its Corporate  Trustee  Administration

Mortgage as part of the property therein stated to be conveyed.

                                    ARTICLE I
                           BONDS OF THE SEVENTH SERIES

         Section 1.1. There shall be a seventh series of bonds designated "First
Mortgage  Bonds,  7.27% Series due December 15, 2008" (the "Bonds of the Seventh
Series"), which shall be limited to $6,000,000 aggregate principal amount, shall
mature on  December  15,  2008,  and shall be issued as fully  registered  bonds
without  coupons in the  denominations  of $1,000 or any multiple  thereof.  The
Bonds of the Seventh  Series  shall bear  interest  (computed  on the basis of a
360-day  year of twelve  30-day  months)  at the rate of seven and  twenty-seven
hundredths  percent  (7.27%)  per annum,  payable  semi-annually  on June 15 and
December 15 of each year,  commencing  June 15, 1997 and at the rate of nine and
twenty-seven  hundredths  percent  (9.27%) per annum on any  overdue  payment of
principal or premium,  if any, and, to the extent  enforceable  under applicable
law, on any overdue  payment of interest.  The Bonds of the Seventh Series shall
be numbered  R-1 and upward and  otherwise  shall be  substantially  in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A. Except as hereinafter provided,  the principal of,
and the premium,  if any,  and the interest on, the Bonds of the Seventh  Series
shall be payable in such coin or currency of the United  States of America as at
the time of payment shall be legal tender for public and private  debts,  at the
office or agency  of the  Company  in the City of  Milwaukee,  Wisconsin  or the
office of the Company in Superior, Wisconsin.

         Notwithstanding  any  provision  to the contrary in the Mortgage or the
Bonds of the  Seventh  Series,  the  first  paragraph  of  Section 9 of the Bond
Purchase Agreement shall govern the method of payment of principal,  premium, if
any,  and  interest on the Bonds of the Seventh  Series to the holders  thereof;
provided, however, that the Corporate Trustee shall have no obligation to comply
with the provisions of Section 9 with respect to any transferee of the Purchaser
or any other holder of the Bonds of the Seventh Series until such  transferee or
holder  shall have made the  agreement  described  in Section 9. Subject to such
proviso,  the  Corporate  Trustee  hereby  consents  to the  method  of  payment
described in Section 9. The Corporate Trustee shall not be liable or responsible
to any holder of Bonds of the Seventh Series entitled to the benefits of Section
9 or to any transferee  thereof or to the Company for any act or omission to act
on the part of the Company or any such holder of Bonds of the Seventh  Series in
connection with Section 9. The Company hereby  indemnifies the Corporate Trustee
against all liabilities, if any, resulting from acts or omissions on its part or
on the part of the Company in connection with Section 9.

         The  Bonds  of the  Seventh  Series  shall  be  dated as of the date of
authentication  thereof by the Corporate Trustee (except that if any Bond of the
Seventh Series shall be

                                    -7-

<PAGE>

authenticated on an interest payment date for the Bonds of the Seventh Series to
which interest has been paid,  such Bond shall be dated as of the day following)
and shall bear interest from the fifteenth day of June or December,  as the case
may be, next  preceding  the date of such Bond to which  interest has been paid;
provided,  however, that if any such Bond shall be authenticated before June 15,
1997,  such Bond shall bear interest from the date of the original  issue of the
Bonds of the Seventh Series;  and provided  further that if the Company shall at
the time of the  authentication  of any Bond of the Seventh Series be in default
in the payment of interest upon the Bonds of the Seventh Series, such Bond shall
be dated as of, and shall bear interest  from,  the date of the beginning of the
period for which such interest is so in default.

         Upon notice as provided in the  following  paragraph,  the Bonds of the
Seventh  Series may be redeemed  prior to  maturity,  in whole at any time or in
part (in multiples of $500,000) from time to time, at the option of the Company,
or by the  application  (either at the option of the  Company or pursuant to the
requirements  of the  Mortgage)  of cash  delivered  to or  deposited  with  the
Corporate  Trustee pursuant to the provisions of Section 39, Section 55, Section
61,  Section 64 or Section 118 of the  Mortgage or with the Proceeds of Released
Property,  in any such case at 100% of the  principal  amount of the Bonds being
redeemed plus interest accrued thereon to the date of redemption,  together with
a premium equal to the Make-Whole  Amount,  if any, with respect to the Bonds of
the Seventh  Series being  redeemed  determined  five Business Days prior to the
date of such redemption.

         Notice of any  redemption  of the Bonds of the Seventh  Series shall be
given by mail,  postage prepaid,  at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to
the date of  redemption,  to the  registered  owners of all Bonds of the Seventh
Series to be so redeemed at their  respective  addresses  appearing on the books
maintained  by the Company  pursuant to Section 13 of the  Mortgage.  Any notice
which is mailed as herein provided shall be  conclusively  presumed to have been
properly and sufficiently given on the date of such mailing,  whether or not the
registered  owner  receives the notice.  In any case,  failure to give notice by
mail, or any defect in such notice,  to the registered  owner of any Bond of the
Seventh  Series  designated  for redemption in whole or in part shall not affect
the  validity of the  proceedings  for the  redemption  of any other Bond of the
Seventh Series. Two Business Days prior to the redemption date specified in such
notice,  the Company shall provide each registered owner of Bonds of the Seventh
Series to be redeemed with written notice of the premium,  if any,  payable with
respect thereto and a reasonably detailed computation of the Make-Whole Amount.

         All partial  redemptions  of Bonds of the Seventh  Series shall be made
ratably  among  all  registered  owners  thereof  in the  proportion  which  the
principal  amount  of the  Bonds  held by each  registered  owner  bears  to the
aggregate  principal amount of all Bonds of the Seventh Series then outstanding,
computed  to the  nearest  $1,000  principal  amount of the Bonds of the Seventh
Series.

         In the event  that the  principal  amount  of the Bonds of the  Seventh
Series is declared due and payable upon the  occurrence  of a Default or becomes
due and payable pursuant to Section 73 of the Mortgage,  there shall then become
due and payable, together with the

                                    -8-
<PAGE>
principal  amount  of the  Bonds of the  Seventh  Series  and  interest  accrued
thereon, a premium equal to the amount of the Make-Whole Amount which would have
been payable with respect to such Bonds of the Seventh Series,  if they had been
redeemed  at the option of the  Company  pursuant  to Section 1.1 in this Eighth
Supplemental  Indenture  on the date on which  the Bonds of the  Seventh  Series
became due and Payable;  provided that such premium, if any, with respect to the
Bonds of the Seventh  Series  shall  become due and payable only of such Default
is, or such sale is made  following  a  Default,  other  than one  specified  in
subsections (e) or (f) of Section 65 of the Mortgage.

         Any Bond of the Seventh Series shall be  transferable by the registered
owner thereof in person,  or by its attorney duly authorized in writing,  at the
office or agency of the company in the City of Milwaukee,  Wisconsin,  or at its
office in Superior, Wisconsin, upon surrender thereof for cancellation, together
with a written  instrument  of  transfer in form  approved  by the Company  duly
executed by such registered owner or by its duly authorized  attorney.  Upon any
such transfer,  a new Bond or Bonds of the Seventh Series for the same aggregate
principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor. Any Bond
of the Seventh  Series may, at the option of the  registered  owner  thereof and
upon surrender  thereof for cancellation at such office or agency,  be exchanged
as prescribed in the Mortgage for another Bond or Bonds of the Seventh Series of
other authorized  denominations  having the same aggregate  principal amount. In
the event any written  instrument of transfer is required in connection with any
transfer or exchange of any Bond of the Seventh  Series,  an  instrument  in the
form  attached  hereto as Exhibit B is hereby  approved  by the  Company for the
purposes of Section 12 of the Mortgage.

         Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  Section  12 or  Section  16 of the
Mortgage, (a) no charge will be made by the Company for any transfer or exchange
of any Bond or the  Seventh  Series  or, in the case of any lost,  destroyed  or
mutilated Bond, the issuance,  authentication  and delivery of a new Bond of the
Seventh  Series  in  substitution  thereof,  whether  for any stamp tax or other
governmental  charge,  if any applicable  thereto or otherwise,  and the Company
shall  reimburse the Corporate  Trustee for all expenses  incurred in connection
therewith  and (b) in the event of any loss,  destruction  or  mutilation of any
Bond of the Seventh  Series,  and a request by the holder for  issuance of a new
Bond of the Seventh  Series in  substitution  therefor,  the holder's  unsecured
indemnity  agreement  shall be deemed to be  satisfactory to the Company and the
Corporate Trustee for purposes of Section 16 of the Mortgage.

         Notwithstanding  any provision of Section 15 of the Mortgage,  Bonds of
the  Seventh  Series  shall  be  authenticated,  issued  and  delivered  only as
definitive  bonds.  Bonds of the  Seventh  Series so  authenticated,  issued and
delivered  may  be in the  form  of  fully  engraved  bonds,  bonds  printed  or
lithographed on engraved borders, bonds printed or bonds typewritten.

         This bond is one of an issue of bonds of the Company issuable in series
and is one of a series  designated  the First Mortgage  Bonds,  7.27% Series due
December  15, 2008 (the  "Bonds of the  Seventh  Series ") created by the Eighth

First  Bank  (N.A.)  (successor  Corporate  Trustee  to  Chemical  Bank &  Trust
Company),  as Corporate Trustee,  all bonds of all series being issued and to be
issued  under and  equally  secured  by a  Mortgage  and Deed of Trust  (herein,
together with any indentures supplemental thereto, called the "Mortgage"), dated
as of March 1, 1943,  executed by the Company to Chemical  Bank & Trust  Company
(First  Bank  (N.A.),  successor  Corporate  Trustee)  and Howard B.  Smith,  as
Trustees.  Reference is made to the Mortgage for a  description  of the property

seventy per centum (70%) in principal  amount of the bonds then  outstanding  of
each series of bonds so to be affected (excluding in any case bonds disqualified
from  voting by reason of the  Company's  interest  therein as  provided  in the
Mortgage);  provided  that,  without the consent of the holder  hereof,  no such
modification or alteration shall, among other things, impair or affect the right
of the holder to receive  payment of the principal of (and premium,  if any) and

and in the respective  amounts  expressed  herein, or permit the creation of any
lien equal or prior to the lien of the  Mortgage  or  deprive  the holder of the
benefit of a lien on the  mortgaged  and pledged  property,  or give any bond or
bonds  secured by the  Mortgage any  preference  over any other bond or bonds so
secured,  or reduce the percentage in principal  amount of the bonds required to
authorize or consent to any such modification or alteration of the Mortgage.

         The Bonds of the Seventh Series may be redeemed  prior to maturity,  in
whole at any time or in part (in  multiples of $500,000)  from time to time,  at
the option of the Company,  or by the  application  (either at the option of the
Company or pursuant to the requirements of the Mortgage) of cash delivered to or

Section 55,  Section 61,  Section 64 or Section 118 of the  Mortgage or with the
Proceeds  of  Released   Property  (as  defined  in  said  Eighth   Supplemental
Indenture),  in any such case at 100% of the principal amount to be so redeemed,
plus accrued  interest  thereon to the  redemption  date together with a premium
equal  to  the  Make-Whole  Amount  (as  defined  in  said  Eighth  Supplemental
Indenture),  if any,  with  respect to the Bonds of the  Seventh  Series,  being
redeemed.

         Notice of any  redemption  of the Bonds of the Seventh  Series shall be
given by mail at least 30 days prior to the  redemption  date, all as more fully
provided in said  Eighth  Supplemental  Indenture  and the  Mortgage.  Notice of
redemption  having been duly given,  the Bonds of the Seventh  Series called for
redemption  shall become due and payable upon the  redemption  date,  and if the
redemption price shall have been deposited with the Corporate Trustee,  interest
thereon  shall cease to accrue on and after the  redemption  date  (unless  such
bonds  shall have been  properly  presented  for  payment on, or within one year
after,  the redemption  date and shall not have been paid) and on the redemption
date or  whenever  thereafter  the  redemption  price  thereof  shall  have been
deposited  with the Corporate  Trustee such bonds shall no longer be entitled to
the lien of the Mortgage.

         The  principal  hereof may be  declared  or may become due prior to the
maturity date  hereinbefore  named on the  conditions,  in the manner and at the
time set forth in the  Mortgage,  upon the  occurrence  of a  default  as in the
Mortgage provided.

the registered  owner hereof and upon surrender  hereof for cancellation at such
office  or  agency,  be  exchanged  as  prescribed  in the  Mortgage  for  other
registered bonds of the same series of other authorized  denominations  having a
like aggregate  principal  amount. No charge will be made by the Company for any
transfer or exchange of this bond or, in case this bond shall be lost, destroyed
or  mutilated,  the  issuance,  authentication  and  delivery  of a new  bond in
substitution  hereof.  The Company and the Corporate  Trustee may deem and treat
the person in whose name this bond is  registered  as the absolute  owner hereof
for the purpose of receiving  payment and for all other purposes and neither the
Company  nor the  corporate  Trustee  shall be  affected  by any  notice  to the
contrary.

        As provided in the  Mortgage,  the Company shall not be required to make
transfers or exchanges of bonds of any series for a period of ten (10) days next
preceding any interest payment date for bonds of said series,  or next preceding
any  designation  of bonds of said series to be redeemed,  and the Company shall
not be required to make transfers or exchanges of any bonds  designated in whole
or in part for redemption.

        This bond shall not become  obligatory  until  First  Bank  (N.A.),  the
Corporate Trustee under the Mortgage,  or its successor  thereunder,  shall have
signed the form of authentication certificate endorsed hereon.

                                  ARTICLE FIRST

                         Securities of the First Series

SECTION 1.01. Description of Series.

                  There shall be a series of  Securities  designated  "Variable
Rate Series,  due December 31, 1993" (herein sometimes referred to as the "First
Series"),  each of which shall also bear the  descriptive  title "First Mortgage
Bond,"  and the  form  thereof,  which  shall  be  established  in an  Officer's
Certificate as provided in the Indenture, shall contain suitable provisions with

principal  amount of Securities  of the First Series which may be  authenticated
and delivered is limited to $45,000,000,  except as provided in Sections 205 and
206 of the  Indenture.  Securities  of the First Series shall mature on December
31, 1993 and shall be issued as fully registered  Securities in denominations of
One Thousand Dollars and, at the option of the Company, in any integral multiple
or  multiples  thereof  (the  exercise  of such  option to be  evidenced  by the
execution and delivery thereof). At the option of the Company, Securities of the
First Series may,  from time to time,  be grouped into one or more Tranches each
having an aggregate principal amount of no less than $10,000,000.  The period of
time each such  Tranche  remains  Outstanding  shall be divided into one or more
Interest Rate Periods,  determined  as provided  below.  Each such Tranche shall
bear interest during each applicable  Interest Rate Period at an annual interest
rate equal to the LIBOR rate for such  period plus 1.25 per centum  (1.25%),  or
such  other  rate as may from  time to time be  agreed  upon in  writing  by the
Company and the Holders of the  Securities  of such  Tranche  with notice to the
Trustee,  payable on the last day of the  applicable  Interest Rate Period;  the
principal,  premium, if any, and interest on each said Security to be payable at
the office or agency of the Company in Apopka, Florida, in such coin or currency
of the United  States of  America as at the time of payment is legal  tender for
public and private  debts.  Securities  of the First Series shall be dated as in
the Indenture provided.  Interest on the Securities of the First Series shall be
computed for each  Interest  Rate Period on the actual number of days elapsed on
the basis of a year consisting of 360 days.

                  If the Company  shall  default in the payment of the principal
of, or premium  or  interest  on, any  Security  of the First  Series,  then the
Company shall pay to the Holder of such Security such overdue principal, premium
or interest, together with interest on such overdue principal and (to the extent
permitted by law) on such  overdue  premium or interest at the at a default rate
equal to the LIBOR rate for each Interest Rate Period, determined as provided in
this paragraph, plus 1.25 per centum (1.25%) plus two per centum (2%) per annum.
For purposes of calculating such default rate,

<PAGE>

                                      -3-

there shall be deemed to exist  successive  Interest Rate Periods,  each for the
term of one month (as defined in paragraph  (2) below),  the first such Interest
Rate  Period  beginning  on the  day on  which  such  default  occurs  and  each
subsequent  Interest  Rate  Period  beginning  on the last day of the  preceding
Interest Rate Period. The Holders of such Securities shall notify the Trustee of
the default rate promptly  after the beginning of each such Interest Rate Period
after default.

                  For purposes of this Section 1.01:

                  (1)  "LIBOR  rate"  shall mean the rate  indicated  by Reuters
(screen  LIBO) as having  been  quoted by  Bankers  Trust  Company at 11:00 a.m.
London  time on the first day of the  applicable  Interest  Rate  Period for the
offering of U.S. dollar deposits in the London interbank market for the Interest
Rate  Period.  The LIBOR rate for any  Interest  Rate  Period with which a LIBOR
period does not coincide will be interpolated  between the next shortest and the
next longest maturity LIBOR rates as quoted by Reuters.



                  (2)  "Interest  Rate Period"  shall mean,  with respect to any
Tranche of Securities of the First Series,  any period of one month, two months,
three months,  six months,  nine months and a final period of any number of days
no longer than ten months determined by the Company and specified in a notice to
the Holders of such Tranche and the Trustee  delivered  on or before  either the
date of first  authentication of the Securities of the First Series or the first
day of an Interest  Rate  Period;  provided  that no Interest  Rate Period shall
extend  beyond  December 31, 1993.  If upon the  expiration  of an Interest Rate
Period for a  particular  Tranche the Company has not  determined  a  subsequent
Interest Rate Period, then such subsequent Interest Rate Period shall be for the
term of the lesser of one month or the days remaining to Maturity.  For purposes
of this  paragraph  (2),  the  term  "month"  or  "months"  shall  mean a period
consisting of 30 days or integral multiples thereof; provided,  however, that in
the event any Interest Rate Period expires on a day which is not a Business Day,
such period  shall be  extended to the next  Business  Day.  Promptly  after the
determination  of any Interest  Rate Period,  the Company and the Holders of the
Securities affected by such Interest Rate Period shall agree upon the applicable
Original Estimated Cost of Funds, calculated as provided in Section 1.02 hereof,
and the  applicable  annual  interest rate for such  Interest  Rate Period;  the
Company shall promptly  thereafter notify the Trustee of such Original Estimated
Cost of Funds and annual interest rate.

                  The  Regular  Record  Date  referred to in Section 207 of the
Indenture for the payment of the interest on the  Securities of the First Series
payable  on any  Interest  Payment  Date  shall be the first  Business  Day next
preceding such Interest Payment Date.

                 The  Company   shall  be  exempt  from  filing  the  Cash  Flow
Certificate  provided in Section  301(d) of the  Indenture  with  respect to the
issuance of Securities of the First Series.

SECTION 1.02. Optional Redemption of Securities of the First Series.

                 (I)  Securities  of the First Series shall be redeemable on any
Business  Day, at the option of the Company,  in whole or in part in  accordance
with Section 903 of the  Indenture  from time to time,  prior to maturity,  upon
notice  delivered to each Holder at its last  address  appearing on the Security
Register not less than one Business Day prior to the date fixed for  redemption,
at a Redemption Price ("First Series General  Redemption Price") (expressed as a
percentage of the principal  amount of the  Securities to be redeemed)  equal to
the  sum of (i)  one  hundred  per  centum  (100%)  plus  (ii) a "First  Series
Prepayment  Surcharge" calculated as hereinafter provided, in each case together
with accrued

<PAGE>

                                      -4-

interest to the date fixed for redemption. For purposes of calculating the First
Series General Redemption Price, the First Series Prepayment  Surcharge shall be
calculated as follows:

                 (A) Determine the difference  between:  (1) Original  Estimated
         Cost of Funds minus (2) the Discount Rate, as hereinafter  defined,  as
         of the Redemption Date.

                 (B)  Add  one  half  (1/2)  of one  per  centum  (1%)  to  such
         difference  (such that the minimum  result shall at all times be 1/2 of
         1%).

                 (C) Multiply  the amount  described in (B) above by the portion
         of the principal amount redeemed.

                 (D) Multiply the amount described in (C) above by the number of
         days between the  Redemption  Date and the end of the current  Interest
         Rate Period for the applicable Tranche of such Securities and divide by
         360.

                 (E) Determine the present value of the  calculation  made under
         (D) above  based upon the end of the current  Interest  Rate Period for
         the applicable  Tranche of such  Securities and the Discount Rate as of
         the Redemption Date.

                 (F)  Add  an  amount  equal  to  a  Second  Series   Prepayment
         Surcharge,  as it would be calculated  pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof,
         for a principal  amount of Securities of the Second Series equal to the
         principal amount of Securities of the First Series then being redeemed,
         as if such  Securities of the Second  Series were being  redeemed as of
         December 31, 1993 for purposes of calculating such Prepayment Surcharge
         except for  establishing  the Discount Rate with respect  thereto.  The
         Discount Rate, for purposes of such calculation, shall be determined by
         reference  to the yields and  interest  rates in effect on the Business
         Day immediately prior to the Redemption Date for such Securities of the
         First  Series.   The  result  shall  be  the  First  Series  Prepayment
         Surcharge.

                  (II) A notice  containing the  calculation of the First Series
General  Redemption  Price shall be prepared by the Company and delivered to the
Trustee and the Holders of the  Securities of the First Series to be redeemed on
the Business Day next preceding the Redemption  Date. The  calculation set forth
in such notice shall be final unless the Holders of the  Securities  so redeemed
notify the Company and the Trustee of an error in such calculation within thirty
days after notice of such calculation.  If it is determined that the Company has
made an error in such  calculation  and the Company pays the  difference to such
Holders promptly after such determination,  then the Company shall not be deemed
to be in  default  under  the  Indenture  by  reason  of  late  payment  of such
difference.

                  (III) As  pertains  to  Securities  of the  First  Series, the
"Discount  Rate" shall mean an  interest  rate equal to the yield to maturity of
Farm  Credit  discount  notes  having  a  weighted  average  life  equal  to the
applicable  Interest  Rate Period for the  Securities  to be  redeemed  plus the
estimated dealer concession for placing Farm Credit discount notes,  obtained by
a polling of Farm Credit Funding  Corporation  dealers on the Business Day prior
to the  Redemption  Date.  The  yield of Farm  Credit  discount  notes  shall be
determined  by a polling  of Farm  Credit  Funding  Corporation  dealers  on the
Business Day prior to the Redemption  Date. This yield will then be converted to
a  semi-annual  bond  equivalent  yield basis for  purposes of any  calculations
hereunder.

                                      -5-


                  (IV) As  pertains  to  Securities  of the  First  Series,  the
"Original  Estimated  Cost of Funds"  shall mean an  interest  rate equal to the
yield to maturity of Farm Credit  discount notes having a weighted  average life
equal to the  applicable  Interest Rate Period for the Securities to be redeemed
plus the estimated  dealer  concession for placing Farm Credit  discount  notes,
obtained by a polling of Farm Credit Funding Corporation dealers on the date the
interest rate for a particular Interest Rate Period is determined.  The yield of
Farm  Credit  discount  notes  shall be  determined  by a polling of Farm Credit
Funding  Corporation  dealers  on the  same day  that  the  interest  rate for a
particular Interest Rate Period is determined. This yield will then be converted
to a semi-annual  bond equivalent  yield basis for purposes of any  calculations
hereunder.


                                 ARTICLE SECOND

                         Securities of the Second Series

SECTION 2.01. Description of Series.

                  There shall be a series of Securities designated "8.73% Series
due January 31, 2013"  (herein  sometimes  referred to as the "Second  Series"),
each of which shall also bear the descriptive  title "First Mortgage Bond",  and
the form thereof,  which shall be  established  in an Officer's  Certificate  as
provided in the Indenture, shall contain suitable provisions with respect to the
matters hereinafter in this Article specified. The aggregate principal amount of
Securities  of the Second  Series which may be  authenticated  and  delivered is
limited  to  $45,000,000,  except as  provided  in  Sections  205 and 206 of the
Indenture.  Securities of the Second Series shall mature on January 31, 2013 and
shall be issued as fully registered  Securities in denominations of One Thousand
Dollars and, at the option of the Company, in any integral multiple or multiples
thereof  (the  exercise  of such option to be  evidenced  by the  execution  and
delivery  thereof); they  shall  bear  interest  at the rate of 8.73% per annum,
payable on July 31, 1994 for the period from  December 31, 1993 to July 31, 1994
and  semi-annually  on  January  31 and July 31 of each  year  thereafter  until
Maturity; the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on each said Security
to be payable at the office or agency of the Company in Apopka, Florida, in such
coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for public and private debts. Securities of the Second Series shall
be dated as in the Indenture provided. Interest on the Securities of the Second
Series shall be computed on the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a
year consisting of 360 days. If the Company shall default in the payment of the
principal of, or premium or interest on, any Security of the Second Series, then
the Company shall pay to the Holder of such Security such overdue principal,
premium or interest, together with interest on such overdue principal and (to
the extent permitted by law) on such overdue  premium or interest at the rate
borne by such Security immediately prior to such default plus two per centum
(2%) per annum.

                  The  Regular  Record  Date  referred  to in Section 207 of the
Indenture for the payment of the interest on the Securities of the Second Series
payable  on any  Interest  Payment  Date  shall be the first  Business  Day next
preceding such Interest Payment Date.

                 The  Company   shall  be  exempt  from  filing  the  Cash  Flow
Certificate  provided in section  301(d) of the  Indenture  with  respect to the
issuance of Securities of the Second Series.

SECTION 2.02. Optional Redemption of Securities of the Second Series.

                  (I) Securities of the Second Series shall be redeemable on any
Business  Day, at the option of the Company,  in whole or in part in  accordance
with Section 903 of the  Indenture  from time to time,  prior to maturity,  upon
notice  delivered to each Holder at its last  address  appearing on the Security
Register not less than one Business Day prior to the date fixed for  redemption,
at a Redemption Price ("Second Series General Redemption Price") (expressed as a
percentage of the principal  amount of the  Securities to be redeemed)  equal to
the  sum of (i) one  hundred  per  centum  (100%)  plus  (ii) a  "Second  Series
Prepayment  Surcharge" calculated as hereinafter provided, in each case together
with  accrued  interest  to the date  fixed  for  redemption.  For  purposes  of
calculating  the Second  Series  General  Redemption  Price,  the Second  Series
Prepayment Surcharge shall be calculated as follows:

                 (A) Determine the difference between:  (1) seven and 32/100 per
         centum (7.32%) minus (2) the Discount Rate, as hereinafter defined, as
         of the Redemption Date.

                 (B)  Add  one  half  (1/2)  of one  per  centum  (1%)  to  such
         difference  (such that the minimum  result shall at all times be 1/2 of
         1% if the  redemption  occurs prior to March 31, 1996;  thereafter,  no
         amount shall be added in this step (B) provided that, in any event, the
         minimum result shall be at least zero).

                 (C) Divide the result determined in (B) above by 2.

                 (D) For each semi-annual period or portion thereof during which
         the principal  amount redeemed was scheduled to have been  Outstanding,
         multiply  the  amount  described  in (C)  above by the  portion  of the
         principal  amount redeemed that was scheduled to have been  Outstanding
         on the  last  day of such  semi-annual  period  (such  that  there is a
         calculation  for each  semi-annual  period  during which the  principal
         amount redeemed was scheduled to have been Outstanding).

                 (E) Determine the present value of each semi-annual calculation
         made under (D) above based upon the scheduled time that interest on the
         principal amount redeemed would have been payable and the Discount Rate
         as of the Redemption Date.

                 (F) Add all of the  calculations  made  under  (E)  above.  The
         result shall be the Second Series Prepayment Surcharge.

Unless  otherwise agreed with a majority of the Holders of the Securities of the
Second  Series to be  Outstanding  after a redemption  under this  Section,  the
Securities  redeemed  under  this  Section  may not be used as a credit  for the
redemption of Securities provided for in Section 2.03 of this First Supplemental
Indenture.

                  (II) A notice  containing the calculation of the Second Series
General  Redemption  Price shall be prepared by the Company and delivered to the
Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of the Second Series to be redeemed on
the Business Day next preceding the Redemption  Date. The  calculation set forth
in such notice shall be final unless the Holders of the  Securities  so redeemed
notify  the  Company  and the  Trustee of an error in such  calculations  within
thirty  days after  notice of such  calculation.  If it is  determined  that the
Company  has  made  an  error  in such  calculation  and the  Company  pays  the
difference to such Holders promptly after such  determination,  then the Company
shall not be  deemed to be in  default  under  the  Indenture  by reason of late
payment of such difference.

                 (III) As  pertains  to  Securities  of the Second  Series,  the
"Discount Rate" shall mean an interest rate determined by adding to the yield on
treasury bonds having  maturities equal to the weighted average life to maturity
of the Securities to be redeemed,  determined as necessary by  interpolation  of
treasury  bonds  having the next longer and next  shorter  maturities ("Treasury
Yield"), as reported on the "MMKS" Reuters  monitor  screen for the Business Day
prior to the Redemption Date for such Securities, the following:

                 (A) the  estimated  spread of Farm Credit  Securities  over the
         Treasury  Yield for such day,  as  reported  in a Farm  Credit  Funding
         Corporation Interest Rate Summary report, and

                 (B) the estimated dealer  concession,  obtained by a polling of
         Farm  Credit  Funding  Corporation  dealers  on the  Business  Day next
         preceding  the  Redemption  Date,  for issuing  Farm Credit  Securities
         having a weighted  average life equal to the number of days between the
         Redemption  Date and Maturity for Securities of the Second Series to be
         redeemed.

In the  event any fact  required  for such  calculation  is not  available,  the
computation  of  Discount  Rate  shall  be made  on the  basis  of a  reasonably
equivalent method of determination.

SECTION 2.03. Sinking Fund for Securities of the Second Series.

                  So long as any  Securities  of the Second  Series shall remain
Outstanding,  the Company  shall  redeem One  Million  Six  Hundred  Sixty-Seven
Thousand Dollars  ($1,667,000)  aggregate  principal amount of Securities of the
Second Series on or before January 31, 2000 and  semi-annually on or before each
July 31 and January 31 thereafter to and including July 31, 2012 at a Redemption
Price equal to par plus interest accrued to the Redemption Date.

                Additional Covenants for First and Second Series

SECTION 3.01. Asset Sale Restrictions for the First and Second Series.

                  (A) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
remain  Outstanding,  if the Company requests the release of Property  Additions
pursuant to Section  1003 or 1004 of the  Indenture  (other than for purposes of
sales of  property  pursuant  to or under  threat,  reasonably  believed  by the
Company to be genuine,  of the exercise of a power of eminent  domain or for tax
exempt  financing  pursuant to Section  1009 of the  Indenture),  the  Officer's
Certificate  filed in connection  with such release shall  identify the Property
Additions that are to be so released.

                  (B) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
remain Outstanding,  if the aggregate amount of Property Additions released upon
such basis  during any  calendar  year shall  exceed ten per centum (10%) of the
amount of Net Property  Additions  shown in the most recent  Property  Additions
Certificate  filed with the Trustee,  then the Company shall promptly notify the
Trustee  and, if there is only one Holder of  Securities  of such  Series,  such
Holder;  and the Company shall within  forty-five days thereafter redeem or have
otherwise retired (other than pursuant to Section 2.03 of this First

<PAGE>

                                      -8-

Supplemental  Indenture),  except to the extent waived,  an aggregate  principal
amount of Securities of such Series equal to the amount of such excess.

                  (C) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
remain Outstanding,  if the aggregate amount of Property Additions released upon
such  basis  shall  exceed  twenty  five per  centum  (25%) of the amount of Net
Property Additions shown in the most recent Property Additions Certificate filed
with the Trustee,  then the Company  shall  promptly  notify the Trustee and, if
there is only one Holder of  Securities  of such Series,  such  Holder;  and the
Company shall within forty-five days thereafter redeem or have otherwise retired
(other than  pursuant  to Section  2.03 of this First  Supplemental  Indenture),
except to the extent waived, an aggregate principal amount of Securities of such
Series equal to the amount of such excess.

                  (D) With respect to the  redemptions  described in  paragraphs
(B) and (C)  above,  the  Company  shall  receive  a credit  for any  Securities
(excluding   Securities   redeemed  pursuant  to  Section  2.03  of  this  First
Supplemental  Indenture)  of the First or  Second  Series  retired  prior to the
respective  Redemption  Date.  With  respect  to the  redemptions  described  in
paragraphs (B) and (C) above,  the Redemption Price shall be the First or Second
Series General  Redemption  Price,  respectively,  plus interest  accrued to the
Redemption  Date. Such redemption  shall be prorated among Holders of Securities
of the First or Second Series except to the extent waived;  any Holder may waive
its right to such  redemption by delivering a written waiver to the Trustee,  in
such form as the  Trustee  shall deem  acceptable,  with a copy to the  Company,
within ten days after the date of such notice of redemption.

                  (E) Unless  otherwise agreed with a majority of the Holders of
the  Securities  of the  First  or  Second  Series  to be  Outstanding  after  a
redemption  under this Section,  the Securities  redeemed under this Section may
not be used as a credit for the redemption of Securities provided for in Section
2.03 of this First Supplemental Indenture.

SECTION 3.02. Ownership by Minnesota Power & Light Company.

                  So long as any Securities of the First or Second Series remain
Outstanding,  if the  Company's  entire  common  stock  shall cease to be owned,
directly or indirectly,  by Minnesota  Power & Light Company,  then the Company
shall promptly notify the Trustee and, if there is only one Holder of Securities
of such Series,  such Holder;  and the Company shall redeem,  within ninety days
thereafter and upon at least thirty days' notice,  all of the Securities of such
Series then Outstanding at the First or Second Series General  Redemption Price,
respectively,  plus interest  accrued to the Redemption Date. Any Holder of such
Series may waive its right to such  redemption by delivering a written waiver to
the Trustee,  in such form as the Trustee shall deem acceptable,  with a copy to
the Company, within ten days after the date of such notice of redemption.

SECTION 3.03. Additional Debt Covenants.

                 (A) So long as any  Securities  of the First or  Second  Series
shall remain  Outstanding,  the Company shall file a Cash Flow  Certificate with
the  Trustee  on or before  March 31 of each  calendar  year  after 1993 for the
period of twelve consecutive  calendar months ending January 31 of such calendar
year and  stating  the  ratio  of its  Total  Debt  divided  by its  Cash  Flow,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles existing
as of  the  date  of  this  First  Supplemental  Indenture,  as  shown  by  such
certificate ("Annual Total Debt/Cash Flow Ratio"). If the Annual Total Debt/Cash
Flow Ratio  shall  exceed the  maximums  specified  below for the  corresponding
period:

              1996 and thereafter                        15:1

then the Company  shall  promptly  notify the Trustee  and, if there is only one
Holder of Securities of such Series,  such Holder; and the Company shall redeem,
within ninety days thereafter and upon at least thirty days' notice, a principal
amount of the Securities of such Series then Outstanding sufficient to cause the
Annual Total  Debt/Cash  Flow Ratio,  determined  in accordance  with  generally
accepted   accounting   principles  existing  as  of  the  date  of  this  First
Supplemental  Indenture,  to equal the appropriate maximum. The Redemption Price
shall be the First or Second Series General Redemption Price, respectively, plus
interest  accrued to the  Redemption  Date.  The  Holders  of a majority  of the
Securities  of such  Series  then  Outstanding  may  waive  such  redemption  by
delivering a written  waiver to the Trustee,  in such form as the Trustee  shall
deem acceptable,  with a copy to the Company,  within ten days after the date of
such notice of redemption.

                  (B) So long as any  Securities  of the  First or Second Series
shall remain Outstanding, the Company shall file with the Trustee, on or before
March 31 of each calendar year, an Accountant's Certificate showing as of
January 31 of such calendar year (1) the aggregate  principal amount of
Securities then Outstanding and (2) the net book value of property, plant and
equipment, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles existing as of the date of this First Supplemental  Indenture,  which
constitute Property Additions.  If such aggregate principal amount of Securities
then Outstanding exceeds sixty per centum (60%) of the net book value of such
property, plant and equipment then the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee
and, if there is only one Holder of Securities of the First or Second Series, 
such Holder; and the Company shall redeem,  within ninety days thereafter and
upon at least thirty days' notice,  a principal amount of the Securities of such
Series then Outstanding sufficient to cause the aggregate  principal  amount of
Securities  then  Outstanding to equal sixty  per  centum  (60%) of the net book
value of such  property,  plant  and equipment.  The  Redemption  Price shall be
the First or Second  Series  General Redemption  Price,  respectively,  plus
interest accrued to the Redemption Date. The Holders of a majority of the
Securities of such Series then  Outstanding may waive such  redemption  by
delivering a written  waiver to the Trustee,  in such form as the Trustee shall
deem  acceptable,  with a copy to the Company,  within ten days after the date
of such notice of redemption.

                  (C) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
shall remain Outstanding,  the Company shall file with the Trustee, on or before
March 31 of each  calendar  year,  an  Accountant's  Certificate  showing  as of
January 31 of such calendar year (1) the Total Debt of the Company,  and (2) the
Company's  Capitalization,  determined in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  existing  as of the  date  of  this  First  Supplemental
Indenture.   If  such  Total  Debt  exceeds   sixty-five  per  centum  (65%)  of
Capitalization, then the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and, if there
is only one Holder of  Securities of such Series,  such Holder;  and the Company
shall  redeem,  within  ninety days  thereafter  and upon at least  thirty days'
notice,  a principal  amount of the  Securities of such Series then  Outstanding
sufficient to cause Total Debt to equal not more than  sixty-five per centum 
(65%) of  Capitalization,  determined  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  existing  as of the  date  of  this  First  Supplemental

                                      -10-

General Redemption Price, respectively,  plus interest accrued to the Redemption
Date.  The  Holders  of a  majority  of  the  Securities  of  such  Series  then
Outstanding  may waive such  redemption  by  delivering a written  waiver to the
Trustee,  in such form as the Trustee shall deem acceptable,  with a copy to the
Company, within ten days after the date of such notice of redemption.

                  (D) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
shall remain  Outstanding,  the Holders of a majority of the  Securities of such
Series then Outstanding may, from time to time but not more than once during any
calendar year,  upon thirty days notice,  request that the Company file with the
Trustee, as of the end of any calendar month other than December, within sixty
days after the end of such month, the Cash Flow Certificate  provided in Section
3.03(A)  and the  Accountant's  Certificates  provided  in Section  3.03(B)  and
3.03(C) of this First  Supplemental  Indenture.  The same redemption  provisions
shall apply as if such Cash Flow Certificate and  Accountant's  Certificates had
been  delivered  pursuant to such  Section  3.03(A),  3.03(B) or 3.03(C) of this
First Supplemental Indenture,  using with respect to Section 3.03(A) the maximum
for the period ending on the January 31 next preceding such calendar  month,  or
if such  calendar  month is before  January 31,  1994,  then the maximum for the
period ending January 31, 1994.

                  (E) Unless  otherwise  agreed by a majority  of the Holders of
the  Securities  of the  First  or  Second  Series  to be  Outstanding  after  a
redemption  under this Section,  the Securities  redeemed under this Section may
not be used as a credit for the redemption of Securities provided for in Section
2.03 of this First Supplemental Indenture.

SECTION 3.04. Restricted Payments.

                  So long as any  Securities of the First or Second Series shall
remain Outstanding, the Company shall not declare or pay any Restricted Payments
unless the Company files an  Accountant's  Certificate  with the Trustee and, if
there is only one  Holder of  Securities  of such  Series,  sends a copy to such
Holder, within thirty days prior to such declaration or payment stating that (A)
the amount of such  payment  shall not exceed  cumulative  net  additions  to or
deductions  from  Surplus,  determined  in accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  existing  as of the  date  of  this  First  Supplemental
Indenture, made after December 31, 1992 (excluding any gains on sale of Property
Additions  during the  immediately  preceding  12 months in excess of twenty per
centum (20%) of the net additions to Surplus made during such 12 month  period);
and (B) that  after such  payment  Capital  plus  Surplus  shall  equal at least
thirty-five  per centum (35%) of  Capitalization,  determined in accordance with
generally accepted  accounting  principles existing as of the date of this First
Supplemental Indenture.

SECTION 3.05. Redemption Upon Taking of Property by Eminent Domain, etc.

                  So long as any  Securities of the First or Second Series shall
remain Outstanding, any Officer's Certificate provided under Section 1006 of the
Indenture  shall  also  state  the net  book  value  of the  Mortgaged  Property
described  therein as taken or sold,  and shall also state the net book value of
such   Mortgaged   Property  that  does  not  constitute   Property   Additions.
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  contained  in  Section  1006 of the
Indenture,  should the aggregate net book value of Mortgaged  Property  taken by
the exercise of the power of eminent domain or sold to an entity  possessing the
power of eminent domain, or to its designee, under a threat, reasonably believed
by the Company to be  genuine,  to  exercise  the same,  be in excess of Fifteen
Million Dollars ($15,000,000),  the Company, shall redeem, within ninety days of
such taking or sale and upon at least  thirty  days  notice,  or have  otherwise
retired,  except to the extent waived,  a pro-rata  amount of Securities of such
Series then Outstanding at the

<PAGE>
                                      -11-

Redemption  Price of par plus  interest  accrued to the  Redemption  Date.  Such
pro-rata  amount shall be  calculated  by dividing (1) the  aggregate  amount of
Property  Additions  so taken or sold plus the  aggregate  net book value of all
Mortgaged  Property so taken or sold which are not Property Additions by (2) the
amount of Net Property  Additions  shown on the most recent  Property  Additions
Certificate  filed with the Trustee and multiplying  such ratio by the aggregate
principal amount of Securities of such Series then Outstanding.  Such redemption
shall be prorated  among  Holders of  Securities  of such  Series  except to the
extent waived; any Holder may waive its right to such redemption by delivering a
written  waiver  to the  Trustee,  in  such  form  as  the  Trustee  shall  deem
acceptable,  with a copy to the Company,  within ten days after the date of such
notice  of  redemption;  such  waiver  shall not  cause a  recalculation  of the
proration.

SECTION 3.06. Maintenance of Business.

                  So long as any Securities of the First or Second Series remain
Outstanding,  if the Company ceases to continue substantially in the business of
providing  water and waste water utility  service in the State of Florida,  then
the Company shall  promptly  notify the Trustee and, if there is only one Holder
of Securities of such Series, such Holder; and the Company shall redeem,  within
ninety days and upon at least thirty days notice,  all of the Securities of such
Series then Outstanding at the First or Second Series General  Redemption Price,
respectively, plus interest accrued to the Redemption Date. Any Holder may waive
its right to such  redemption by delivering a written waiver to the Trustee,  in
such form as the  Trustee  shall deem  acceptable,  with a copy to the  Company,
within ten days after the date of such notice of redemption.

SECTION 3.07. Return of Redemption Moneys upon Waiver.

                  Upon receipt of any waiver of  redemption  by any Holder,  the
Trustee shall return to the Company the  redemption  money,  if any, held by the
Trustee for the redemption of such Holder's Securities.

SECTION 3.08. Special Merger Provisions.

                  (A) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
remain  Outstanding,  the Company  shall not merge or  consolidate  with another
entity  unless the Company  shall have filed with the Trustee,  and, if there is
only one  Holder  of  Securities  of such  Series,  such  Holder,  an  Officer's
Certificate  stating  that (1) the Company or an entity  directly or  indirectly
owned one hundred per centum (100%) by Minnesota  Power & Light Company shall be
the  continuing  and  surviving  corporation  and,  (2)  after  such  merger  or
consolidation,  there shall exist no Event of Default or event  which,  with the
lapse of time or  giving  of  notice,  or  both,  would  constitute  an Event of
Default,  and the  Company  shall be able to issue at least One  Dollar  ($1) of
Securities under the provisions of Section 401 or 501 of the Indenture,  in each
case, using a Cash Flow Certificate stating an Annual Total Debt/Cash Flow Ratio
not to exceed the  maximums  specified  in  Section  3.03(A)  hereof  (using the
maximum for the period ending on the January 31 next preceding  such merger,  or
if such  merger is before  January  31,  1994,  then the  maximum for the period
ending  January  31,  1994)  rather than the Cash Flow  Certificate  provided in
Section 301(d) of the Indenture.

                  (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may consolidate
or merge with Lehigh  Utilities,  Inc. So long as any Securities of the First or
Second  Series  remain  Outstanding,  if the  Company  shall not have  merged or
consolidated with Lehigh Utilities, Inc. by April 30, 1993, then the Company

<PAGE>

shall cause, within ninety days thereafter,  all of the outstanding common stock
of Lehigh Utilities, Inc. to be subjected to the Lien of the Indenture. When all
such  Securities  cease to be Outstanding or upon such merger or  consolidation,
the Trustee shall release such stock upon receipt of a Company Order  requesting
such release and stating the basis therefor.

SECTION 3.09. Additional Property.

                  (A) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
remain Outstanding, the Deltona System Assets shall be released from the Lien of
the Mortgage and Deed of Trust described in paragraph J of the Excepted Property
Clause of the  Original  Indenture,  on or before  December  31,  1994;  and the

practicable, by supplemental indenture, delete such paragraph J and subject such
property, other than Excepted Property, to the Lien of the Indenture.

                  (B) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
remain  Outstanding,  when the Marco Island System Assets shall be released from
the Lien of the Mortgage and Security Agreements described in paragraph K of the
Excepted Property Clause of the Original Indenture, the Company and the Trustee,
upon the request of the Company, shall, as soon as practicable,  by supplemental
indenture,  delete  such  paragraph  K and  subject  such  property,  other than
Excepted Property, to the Lien of the Indenture.

                  (C) So long as any  Securities  of the First or Second  Series
remain  Outstanding,  when the Lehigh  Assets shall be released from the Lien of
the  Mortgage,  Security  Agreement and  Assignment  of Rents  described  in
paragraph L of the Excepted Property Clause of the Original  Indenture,  and the
Company, upon the request of the Company, shall have consolidated or merged with
Lehigh  Utilities,  Inc.,  the  Company  and  the  Trustee  shall,  as  soon  as
practicable, by supplemental indenture, delete such paragraph L and subject such
property, other than Excepted Property, to the Lien of the Indenture.

SECTION 3.10. Refinancing of the Deltona Debt.

                  The  Company  shall  be  exempt  from  filing  the  Cash  Flow
Certificate  provided  in  Section  301(d)  of the  Indenture  with  respect  to
Securities issued to refinance Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) in debt due
December 1, 1994 pursuant to the Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of December
1, 1984 from Deltona Utilities, Inc. (Southern States Utilities, Inc., successor
in interest) to Southeast  Bank,  N.A.  (First Union  National  Bank of Florida,
successor  in  interest)  as trustee.  The Company  shall  instead file with the
Trustee an Officer's  Certificate stating that the proceeds of the Securities to
be  authenticated  and  delivered  will be used to refinance the debt secured by
such Mortgage and Deed of Trust and that the Deltona System  Assets,  other than
Excepted  Property,  will be subjected to the Lien of the  Indenture  reasonably
contemporaneously with the delivery of such Securities.

SECTION 3.11. Bond Purchase Agreement.

                  So long as National Bank for Cooperatives  ("CoBank") shall be
the sole owner of all Securities of the First or Second Series then Outstanding,
the Company shall  redeem,  within ten days,  an aggregate  principal  amount of
Securities  of  such  Series,  the  redemption  of  which  is  demanded,   in  a
certificate,  signed by the President,  any Vice President or any Assistant Vice
President of CoBank,  stating that CoBank is entitled to such  redemption  under
the Bond Purchase Agreement dated March 31, 1993 between CoBank and the Company,
describing the event giving CoBank such right of redemption, and

<PAGE>

                                      -13-

stating  that  such  redemption  is  required  by  terms of such  Bond  Purchase
Agreement.  The  Redemption  Price shall be the First or Second  Series  General
Redemption Price, respectively, plus interest accrued to the Redemption Date.

SECTION 3.12. Property Additions Certificates.

                  So long as any  Securities of the First or Second Series shall
remain Outstanding, the Company shall file a Property Additions Certificate with
the Trustee at least once during each calendar year.

SECTION 3.13. Amendment to Indenture: Acceleration.

                  So long as the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the
First or Second Series then Outstanding  exceeds twenty-five per centum (25%) of
the aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series then Outstanding, the
words  "twenty-five  per  centum  (25%)"  shall  be  substituted  for the  words
"thirty-three  and  one-third  per  centum  (33  1/3%)" in  Section  1102 of the
Original  Indenture.  In case any  Securities  of the First or Second Series are
paid by reason of a declaration of acceleration  pursuant to Section 1102 of the
Original  Indenture,  the Company shall pay to the Holders of such  Securities a
premium  equal to the  Prepayment  Surcharge,  calculated as provided in Section
1.02 of this First  Supplemental  Indenture with respect to the First Series and
Section  2.02 of this First  Supplemental  Indenture  with respect to the Second
Series,  multiplied  by the  aggregate  principal  amount of such  Securities so
accelerated,  provided  that the  payment  of such  premium  does not render the
Company insolvent.  If the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the First
or Second Series then  Outstanding  exceeds  twenty-five per centum (25%) of the
aggregate  principal  amount of Securities of all series then Outstanding and an
Event of Default shall exist, then the Holders of the Securities of the First or
Second  Series may  demand the  redemption  of such  Securities  of the First or
Second  Series held by them upon ten days written  notice to the Company and the
Trustee.  The  Redemption  Price  shall be the  First or Second  Series  General
Redemption Price, respectively, plus interest accrued to the Redemption Date.

SECTION 3.14. Amendment to Indenture; Gains from the Sale of Property.

                  The  Company  may  include   gains  from  the  sale  or  other
disposition  of property,  in an amount not to exceed twenty per centum (20%) of
its net income after tax, in calculating Cash Flow under the Indenture.

SECTION 3.15. Redemptions on a Business Day

                  In the event any Redemption Date for a redemption  required by
Section  2.03 hereof  shall not be a Business  Day,  interest  on the  principal
amount then due shall accrue to and be paid on the next Business  Day;  provided
that the  Company  may, at its  option,  upon ten (10) days prior  notice to the
Trustee and the Holders,  satisfy a  redemption  required by Section 2.03 on the
Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date at a Redemption Price equal
to par plus interest  accrued to such prior  Business Day. Any other  Redemption
Date for  Securities  of the First  Series or the  Second  Series  shall be on a
Business Day.

least a majority of the  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Securities  of the
First or Second  Series then  Outstanding.  So long as the  aggregate  principal
amount of  Securities  of the First or Second  Series then  Outstanding  exceeds
twenty-five per centum (25%) of the aggregate  principal amount of Securities of
all series then  Outstanding,  the  provisions of this Article Third may not be
waived nor  amended  without  the  written  consent of the Holders of at least a
majority of the aggregate  principal amount of Securities of the First or Second
Series then Outstanding, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

SECTION 3.17. Clarification of Permitted Liens.

                  The Permitted  Liens described in Clause (1) of the definition
of  Permitted  Liens in the  Original  Indenture  shall  not  include  any Liens

                 amount of such Liens or for the  payment of which the
                 Company  has  deposited  with the  Trustee or with an
                 escrow  agent  cash or  other  property  with a value
                 equal to the full amount of such Liens;"

                         Minnesota Power & Light Company

                              OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE


         James K. Vizanko, the Treasurer of Minnesota Power & Light Company (the
"Company"),  pursuant to the authority  granted in the Board  Resolutions of the
Company dated March 20, 1996, and Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture  defined
herein, does hereby certify to The Bank of New York (the "Trustee"),  as Trustee
under the Indenture of the Company (For Unsecured  Subordinated  Debt Securities
relating to Trust Securities) dated as of March 1, 1996 (the "Indenture") that:
                  
         1.       The  securities  of the first  series  to be issued  under the
                  Indenture  shall  be  designated  "8.05%  Junior  Subordinated
                  Debentures,  Series A, Due 2015" (the "Debentures of the First
                  Series").  The Debentures of the First Series are to be issued
                  to MP&L Capital I, a Delaware  statutory  business  trust (the
                  "Trust"). All capitalized terms used in this certificate which
                  are not defined herein but are defined in the Indenture  shall
                  have the meanings set forth in the Indenture;

         2.       The  Debentures  of the  First  Series  shall  be  limited  in
                  aggregate principal amount to $77,500,000 at any time
                  Outstanding,  except as  contemplated in Section 301(b) of the
                  Indenture;

         3.       The  Debentures  of the  First  Series  shall  mature  and the
                  principal  shall be due and payable  together with all accrued
                  and unpaid interest thereon on December 31, 2015;

         4.       The  Debentures of the First Series shall bear interest  from,
                  and including,  the date of original issuance,  at the rate of
                  8.05% per annum payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June
                  30,  September  30 and  December  31 of each  year  (each,  an
                  "Interest Payment Date") commencing March 31, 1996. The amount
                  of  interest  payable  for any such period will be computed on
                  the basis of a 360-day  year of twelve  30-day  months and for
                  any  period  shorter  than a full  month,  on the basis of the
                  actual number of days elapsed in such period.  Interest on the
                  Debentures   of  the  First  Series  will  accrue  from,   and
                  including,  the date of original  issuance and will accrue to,
                  and including, the first Interest Payment Date, and thereafter
                  will accrue from,  and  excluding,  the last Interest  Payment
                  Date through  which  interest  has been paid or duly  provided
                  for.  In the event  that any  Interest  Payment  Date is not a
                  Business  Day,  then payment of interest  payable on such date
                  will be made on the next  succeeding  day which is a  Business
                  Day (and without any  interest or other  payment in respect of
                  such delay),  except that, if such Business Day is in the next
                  succeeding  calendar  year,  such payment shall be made on the
                  immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same
                  force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date;

         5.       Each  installment  of  interest  on a  Debenture  of the First
                  Series  shall be  payable  to the  Person  in whose  name such
                  Debenture  of the First Series is  registered  at the close of
                  business  on  the   Business   Day  15  days   preceding   the
                  corresponding  Interest  Payment 

<PAGE>
                  Date (the  "Regular  Record  Date") for the  Debentures of the
                  First Series; provided, however, that if the Debentures of the
                  First Series are held neither by the Trust nor by a securities
                  depositary,  the  Company  shall  have the right to change the
                  Regular Record Date by one or more Officer's Certificates. Any
                  installment  of interest on the Debentures of the First Series
                  not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease
                  to be payable to the Holders of such  Debentures  of the First
                  Series on such  Regular  Record  Date,  and may be paid to the
                  Persons in whose name the  Debentures  of the First Series are
                  registered  at the close of business on a Special  Record Date
                  to be fixed by the Trustee  for the payment of such  Defaulted
                  Interest. Notice of such Defaulted Interest and Special Record
                  Date shall be given to the  Holders of the  Debentures  of the
                  First  Series  not less  than 10 days  prior  to such  Special
                  Record  Date,  or may be paid at any time in any other  lawful
                  manner  not   inconsistent   with  the   requirements  of  any
                  securities  exchange  on which  the  Debentures  of the  First
                  Series may be listed,  and upon such notice as may be required
                  by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture;

         6.       The  principal  and  each   installment  of  interest  on  the
                  Debentures  of the  First  Series  shall be  payable  at,  and
                  registration  and  registration  of transfers and exchanges in
                  respect of the  Debentures of the First Series may be effected
                  at,  the  office or agency of the  Company  in The City of New
                  York;  provided  that  payment of interest  may be made at the
                  option of the  Company by check  mailed to the  address of the
                  persons entitled thereto under the Indenture. Notices, demands
                  to or upon the  Company in respect  of the  Debentures  of the
                  First  Series  may be  served  at the  office or agency of the
                  Company in The City of New York. The Trustee will initially be
                  the agency of the  Company  for such  service  of notices  and
                  demands;  provided,  however,  that the Company  reserves  the
                  right to change,  by one or more  Officer's  Certificates  any
                  such  office  or  agency.  The  Company  will be the  Security
                  Registrar and the Paying Agent for the Debentures of
                  the First Series;

         7.       The  Debentures  of the First Series will be  redeemable on or
                  after March 20, 2001 at the option of the Company, at any time
                  and from time to time,  in whole or in part,  at a  redemption
                  price equal to 100% of the principal  amount of the Debentures
                  of the First Series being redeemed,  together with any accrued
                  interest,  including  Additional  Interest,  if  any,  to  the
                  redemption  date, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days'
                  notice  given  as  provided  in the  Indenture.  The  Company,
                  however,  may not redeem less than all Outstanding  Debentures
                  of the First  Series  unless the  conditions  specified in the
                  last paragraph of this item are met;

                  The  Debentures of the First Series will also be redeemable at
                  any time at the option of the Company upon the  occurrence and
                  during  the  continuation  of a Tax  Event  or  an  Investment
                  Company Event in whole but not in part, at a redemption  price
                  equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures of the
                  First  Series  then  Outstanding  plus any  accrued and unpaid
                  interest,  including  Additional  Interest,  if  any,  to  the
                  redemption  date, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days'
                  notice given as provided in the  Indenture.  "Tax Event" means
                  the  receipt by the Trust of an opinion of counsel  (which may
                  be counsel to the Company or an affiliate  but not an employee
                  thereof and which must be acceptable  to the Property  Trustee
                  under the Trust

                  Agreement)  experienced in such matters to the effect that, as
                  a  result  of any  amendment  to,  or  change  (including  any
                  announced prospective change) in, the laws (or any regulations
                  thereunder) of the United States or any political  subdivision
                  or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation,  or
                  as  a  result  of  any  official  administrative  or  judicial
                  decision  interpreting  or applying such laws or  regulations,
                  which  amendment or change is effective or such  pronouncement
                  or  decision  is  announced  on or after the date of  original
                  issuance of the 8.05%  Cumulative  Quarterly  Income Preferred
                  Securities of the Trust (the "Preferred Securities"), there is
                  more than an insubstantial risk that (i) the Trust is, or will
                  be  within  90 days of the date  thereof,  subject  to  United
                  States federal  income tax with respect to income  received or
                  accrued on the  Debentures of the First Series,  (ii) interest
                  payable by the Company on the  Debentures of the First Series,
                  is not,  or  within 90 days of the date  thereof  will not be,
                  deductible,  in whole or in part,  for United  States  federal
                  income tax purposes,  or (iii) the Trust is, or will be within
                  90 days of the date thereof, subject to more than a de minimis
                  amount of other taxes,  duties or other governmental  charges.
                  "Investment Company Event" means the occurrence of a change in
                  law or regulation or a change in interpretation or application
                  of  law  or  regulation  by  any  legislative   body,   court,
                  governmental agency or regulatory authority to the effect that
                  the Trust is or will be  considered  an  "investment  company"
                  that is required to be registered under the Investment Company
                  Act of 1940, as amended, which change in law becomes effective
                  on or after the date of  original  issuance  of the  Preferred
                  Securities.

                  The Debentures of the First Series will also be redeemable, in
                  whole but not in part,  at the option of the Company  upon the
                  termination  and liquidation of the Trust pursuant to an order
                  for the  dissolution,  termination or liquidation of the Trust
                  entered by a court of competent  jurisdiction  at a redemption
                  price equal to 100% of the principal  amount of the Debentures
                  of the First  Series  then  Outstanding  plus any  accrued and
                  unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any, to the
                  redemption  date, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days'
                  notice given as provided in the Indenture.

                  The Company may not redeem less than all the Debentures of the
                  First  Series   Outstanding  unless  all  accrued  and  unpaid
                  interest (including any Additional  Interest) has been paid in
                  full on all Debentures of the First Series  Outstanding  under
                  the Indenture for all quarterly  interest periods  terminating
                  on or  prior  to  the  date  of  redemption  or  if a  partial
                  redemption  of the  Preferred  Securities  would  result  in a
                  delisting  of  such  securities  by  any  national  securities
                  exchange on which they are then listed;

         8.       So long as any Debentures of the First Series are Outstanding,
                  the failure of the Company to pay  interest on any  Debentures
                  of the First Series  within 30 days after the same becomes due
                  and  payable  (whether  or not  payment is  prohibited  by the
                  provisions  of  Article   Fifteen  of  the  Indenture)   shall
                  constitute  an Event of  Default;  provided,  however,  that a
                  valid extension of the interest  payment period by the Company
                  as  contemplated in Section 311 of the Indenture and paragraph
                  (9) of this Certificate  shall not constitute a failure to pay
                  interest for this purpose;

                                        -3-

         9.       Pursuant to Section 311 of the  Indenture,  the Company  shall
                  have the right,  at any time and from time to time  during the
                  term of the  Debentures  of the First  Series,  to extend  the
                  interest   payment   period  to  a  period  not  exceeding  20
                  consecutive  quarters  (an  "Extension  Period")  during which
                  period  interest will be compounded  quarterly.  At the end of
                  the  Extension  Period,  the  Company  shall pay all  interest
                  accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon at the rate
                  specified for the  Debentures of the First Series,  compounded
                  quarterly,   to  the  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law).
                  However,  during any such Extension Period,  the Company shall
                  not declare or pay any dividend or distribution  (other than a
                  dividend or  distribution  in common stock of the Company) on,
                  or redeem,  purchase,  acquire or make a  liquidation  payment
                  with respect to, any of its capital stock, or make any payment
                  of  principal,  interest  or  premium  , if any,  on or repay,
                  repurchase or redeem any indebtedness  that is pari passu with
                  the Debentures of the First Series (including other Securities
                  issued under the  Indenture),  or make any guarantee  payments
                  with respect to the foregoing. Prior to the termination of any
                  such  Extension  Period,  the Company  may further  extend the
                  interest  payment period,  provided that such Extension Period
                  together with all such previous and further extensions thereof
                  shall not exceed 20  consecutive  quarters  at any one time or
                  extend beyond the maturity date of the Debentures of the First
                  Series.  Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and
                  the payment of all amounts  then due, the Company may select a
                  new Extension Period,  subject to the above  requirements.  No
                  interest shall be due and payable during an Extension  Period,
                  except at the end thereof.  The Company will give the Trust or
                  other  Holders  and the Trustee  notice of its  election of an
                  Extension  Period prior to the earlier of (i) one Business Day
                  prior to the  record  date for the  distribution  which  would
                  occur but for such  election  or (ii) the date the  Company is
                  required  to give  notice to the New York  Stock  Exchange  or
                  other  applicable  self-regulatory  organization of the record
                  date;

         10.      In the  event  that,  at any time  subsequent  to the  initial
                  authentication  and  delivery of the  Debentures  of the First
                  Series, the Debentures of the First Series are to be held by a
                  securities depositary,  the Company may at such time establish
                  the matters contemplated in clause (r) in the second paragraph
                  of Section 301 of the  Indenture in an  Officer's  Certificate
                  supplemental to this Certificate;

         11.      No  service  charge  shall  be made  for the  registration  of
                  transfer or exchange of the  Debentures  of the First  Series;
                  provided,  however,  that the Company may require payment of a
                  sum sufficient to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge
                  that  may be  imposed  in  connection  with  the  exchange  or
                  transfer;

         12.      The Debentures of the First Series shall have such other terms
                  and  provisions  as are  provided  in the  form  set  forth in
                  Exhibit A hereto,  and shall be issued in  substantially  such
                  form;

         13.      In the  event  that the  Debentures  of the First  Series  are

         MINNESOTA  POWER & LIGHT  COMPANY,  a  corporation  duly  organized and
existing  under  the laws of the  State  Minnesota  (herein  referred  to as the
"Company",  which term includes any successor  Person under the Indenture),  for
value received,  hereby promises to pay to  ____________________,  or registered
assigns,  the principal sum of  _________________  Dollars on December 31, 2015,
and to pay interest on said principal sum, from and including, March 20, 1996 or
from,  and  excluding,  the most recent  Interest  Payment  Date  through  which
interest  has been paid or duly  provided  for,  quarterly on March 31, June 30,
September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing March 31, 1996 at the rate
of 8.05% per annum  until the  principal  hereof is paid or made  available  for
payment.  The amount of interest  payable on any Interest  Payment Date shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Interest on the
Securities  of this series  will  accrue  from,  and  including,  March 20, 1996
through the first Interest  Payment Date, and thereafter will accrue,  from, and
excluding,  the last Interest  Payment Date through which interest has been paid
or duly  provided  for.  In the event that any  Interest  Payment  Date is not a
Business Day, then payment of interest  payable on such date will be made on the
next  succeeding  day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other
payment in respect of such delay),  except that,  if such Business Day is in the
next  succeeding  calendar year,  such payment shall be made on the  immediately
preceding  Business  Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made
on the Interest  Payment Date. The interest so payable,  and punctually  paid or
duly  provided  for,  on any  Interest  Payment  Date will,  as provided in such
Indenture,  be paid to the  Person in whose name this  Security  (or one or more
Predecessor  Securities)  is  registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest, which shall be the Business Day 15 days preceding
such  Interest  Payment Date.  Any such interest not so punctually  paid or duly
provided  for will  forthwith  cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular
Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or
one or more Predecessor  Securities) is registered at the close of business on a
Special  Record Date for the payment of such  Defaulted  Interest to be fixed by
the Trustee,  notice  whereof  shall be given to Holders of  Securities  of this
series not less than 10 days prior to such Special  Record  Date,  or be paid at
any time in any other lawful manner not  inconsistent  with the  requirements of
any  securities  exchange on which the  Securities of this series may be listed,
and upon such  notice as may be  required  by such  exchange,  all as more fully
provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.

         Payment of the  principal of and premium,  if any, and interest on this
Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that
purpose in The City of New York,  the State of New York in such coin or currency
of the United  States of  America as at the time of payment is legal  tender for
payment of public and private debts,  provided,  however, that, at the 



<PAGE>

option of the Company,  interest on this Security may be paid by check mailed to
the address of the person  entitled thereto, as such address shall appear on the
Security Register.

         Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set
forth on the reverse  hereof,  which further  provisions  shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

         Unless the  certificate of  authentication  hereon has been executed by
the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security
shall  not be  entitled  to any  benefit  under  the  Indenture  or be  valid or
obligatory for any purpose.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Company has caused this instrument to be duly
executed.

                    REVERSE OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE

                  This Security is one of a duly authorized  issue of securities
of the Company (herein called the "Securities"),  issued and to be issued in one
or more series under an Indenture,  dated as of March 1, 1996 (herein,  together
with any amendments thereto,  called the "Indenture",  which term shall have the
meaning assigned to it in such instrument),  between the Company and The Bank of
New York,  as Trustee  (herein  called the  "Trustee",  which term  includes any
successor  trustee  under the  Indenture),  and  reference is hereby made to the
Indenture,  including the Board Resolutions and Officer's Certificate filed with
the Trustee on March 20, 1996 creating the series designated on the face hereof,
for a statement of the  respective  rights,  limitations  of rights,  duties and
immunities  thereunder  of the  Company,  the  Trustee  and the  Holders  of the
Securities  and of the terms  upon  which  the  Securities  are,  and are to be,
authenticated  and delivered.  This Security is one of the series  designated on
the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $77,500,000.

                  The  Securities of this series are subject to redemption  upon
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail,  at any time on or after
March 20,  2001 as a whole or in part,  at the  election  of the  Company,  at a
Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount,  together in the case of
any such redemption with accrued interest to, but not including,  the Redemption
Date,  but interest  installments  whose Stated  Maturity is on or prior to such
Redemption  Date will be payable to the Holder of such Security,  or one or more
Predecessor  Securities,  of  record  at the close of  business  on the  related
Regular  Record  Date  referred  to on the face  hereof,  all as provided in the
Indenture.

                  The  Securities  of this series will also be redeemable at the
option of the Company if a Tax Event or an Investment  Company Event shall occur
and be continuing, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal  amount of the Securities of this series then  Outstanding plus
any accrued and unpaid interest,  including Additional Interest,  if any, to the
redemption  date,  upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days'  notice given as
provided in the  Indenture.  "Tax Event"  means the receipt by MP&L Capital I, a
Delaware  statutory business trust (the "Trust") of an opinion of counsel (which
may be counsel to the Company or an  affiliate  but not an employee  thereof and
which must be  acceptable  to the Property  Trustee  under the Trust  Agreement)
experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to,
or change  (including  any  announced  prospective  change) in, the laws (or any
regulations  thereunder)  of the United States or any political  subdivision  or
taxing authority  thereof or therein affecting  taxation,  or as a result of any
official  administrative or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws
or regulations,  which amendment or change is effective or such pronouncement or
decision is  announced  on or after the date of  original  issuance of the 8.05%
Cumulative  Quarterly Income  Preferred  Securities of the Trust (the "Preferred
Securities"), there is more than an insubstantial risk that (i) the Trust is, or
will be within 90 days of the date  thereof,  subject to United  States  federal
income tax with respect to income  received or accrued on the  Securities,  (ii)
interest payable by the Company on the Securities,  is not, or within 90 days of
the date thereof will not be, deductible, in whole or in part, for United States
federal income tax purposes, or (iii) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of
the date  thereof,  subject  to more than a de  minimis  amount of other  taxes,
duties or other  governmental  charges.  "Investment  Company  Event"  means the
occurrence  of a change in law or regulation  or a change in  interpretation  or
application of law or regulation by any legislative  body,  court,  governmental
agency  or  regulatory  authority  to the  effect  that the  Trust is or will be
considered an "investment  company" that is required to be registered  under the
Investment  Company  Act of  1940,  as  amended,  which  change  in law  becomes
effective on or after the date of original issuance of the Preferred Securities.

<PAGE>
                  The  Securities  of this  series will also be  redeemable,  in
whole but not in part,  at the option of the Company  upon the  termination  and
liquidation of the Trust pursuant to an order for the  dissolution,  termination
or  liquidation of the Trust entered by a court of competent  jurisdiction  at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this
series  then  Outstanding  plus  any  accrued  and  unpaid  interest,  including
Additional  Interest,  if any, to the redemption date, upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture.

                  In the event of  redemption  of this  Security in part only, a
new Security or Securities  of this series and of like tenor for the  unredeemed
portion  hereof  will be  issued  in the  name of the  Holder  hereof  upon  the
cancellation hereof.

                  The indebtedness  evidenced by this Security is, to the extent
provided in the Indenture,  subordinated  and subject in right of payment to the
prior  payment in full of all Senior  Indebtedness,  and this Security is issued
subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.  Each Holder of
this  Security,  by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions,  (b)  authorizes  and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such
action as may be necessary or  appropriate  to  acknowledge  or  effectuate  the
subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his  attorney-in-fact for
any and all such purposes.  Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby
waives all notice of the acceptance of the  subordination  provisions  contained
herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior  Indebtedness,  whether now
outstanding or hereafter incurred,  and waives reliance by each such Holder upon
said provisions.

                  The Indenture  contains  provisions for defeasance at any time
of the  entire  indebtedness  of this  Security  upon  compliance  with  certain
conditions set forth in the Indenture.

                  If an Event of  Default  with  respect to  Securities  of this
series shall occur and be  continuing,  the principal of the  Securities of this
series  may be  declared  due and  payable  in the  manner  and with the  effect
provided in the Indenture.

                  The  Indenture  permits,  with certain  exceptions  as therein
provided,  the  amendment  thereof  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the  Securities  of
each series to be affected  under the  Indenture  at any time by the Company and
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the  Securities  at the time  Outstanding  of all  series  to be  affected.  The
Indenture  also  contains   provisions   permitting  the  Holders  of  specified
percentages  in principal  amount of the  Securities  of each series at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive
compliance  by the Company with certain  provisions of the Indenture and certain
past defaults  under the Indenture and their  consequences.  Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Security  shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future  Holders of this Security and of any Security  issued
upon the  registration  of  transfer  hereof or in  exchange  herefor or in lieu
hereof,  whether  or not  notation  of such  consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

                  As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture,
the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder,  unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a continuing  Event of Default with respect to the
Securities of this series,  the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal  amount of the  Securities  of all series at the time  Outstanding  in
respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall
have made written request to the Trustee to institute  proceedings in 

                                        -4-
<PAGE>
respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and  offered the Trustee  reasonable
indemnity,  and the  Trustee  shall  not have  received  from the  Holders  of a
majority in aggregate  principal  amount of Securities of all series at the time
Outstanding  in respect of which an Event of Default  shall have occurred and be
continuing a direction  inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to
institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request
and offer of indemnity.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by
the Holder of this  Security  for the  enforcement  of any payment of  principal
hereof or any premium or interest  hereon on or after the  respective  due dates
expressed herein.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Security  or of the  Indenture  shall  alter or  impair  the  obligation  of the
Company,  which is absolute and  unconditional,  to pay the principal of and any
premium and interest on this Security at the times,  place and rate,  and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

                  The  Company  has the  right at any time and from time to time
during the term of the Securities of this series to extend the interest  payment
period to a period not exceeding 20 consecutive  quarters (an "Extended Interest
Payment Period"),  and at the end of such Extended Interest Payment Period,  the
Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid  (together  with interest
thereon  at the  same  rate as  specified  for the  Securities  of this  series,
compounded  quarterly,  to the extent  permitted by applicable  law);  provided,
however, that during such Extended Interest Payment Period the Company shall not
declare  or  pay  any  dividend  or  distribution  (other  than  a  dividend  or
distribution in common stock of the Company) on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or
make a liquidation  payment with respect to, any of its capital  stock,  or make
any payment of principal on, interest or premium if any, on or repay, repurchase
or redeem any indebtedness that is pari passu with the Securities of this series
(including other Securities  issued under the Indenture),  or make any guarantee
payments with respect to the  foregoing.  Prior to the  termination  of any such
Extended  Interest  Payment Period,  the Company may further extend the interest
payment period,  provided that such Extended  Interest Payment Period,  together
with all such  previous  and  further  extensions  thereof,  may not  exceed  20
consecutive  quarters or extend beyond the Stated  Maturity of the Securities of
this series.  Upon the termination of any such Extended  Interest Payment Period
and the payment of all amounts  then due,  the Company may select a new Extended
Interest Payment Period,  subject to the above requirements.  No interest during
the Extended  Interest Payment Period,  except at the end thereof,  shall be due
and payable.  The Company shall give the Holder of this  Security  notice of its
selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period as provided in or pursuant to
the Indenture.

                  The  Securities of this series are issuable only in registered
form without coupons in denominations of $25 and any integral  multiple thereof.
As provided in the  Indenture  and  subject to certain  limitations  therein set
forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount  of  Securities  of this  series  and of  like  tenor  and of  authorized
denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

                  As  provided  in  the  Indenture,  the  Company  shall  not be
required to make  transfers  or  exchanges  of  Securities  of this series for a
period of 15 days immediately preceding the date of the mailing of any notice of
redemption  of such  Securities  and the  Company  shall not be required to make
transfers  or  exchanges  of any  Securities  of this  series  so  selected  for
redemption in whole or in part (except the unredeemed portion of thereof).

                                        -5-
<PAGE>
                  No service charge shall be made for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

                  The  Company,  the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this  Security is  registered  as the
absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue,
and  neither  the  Company,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

                  All  terms  used in this  Security  which are  defined  in the
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

               been  presented to the Trustee proof  satisfactory  to it and the
               Company that such Securities are held by a bona fide purchaser or
               purchasers in whose hands such  Securities are valid  obligations
               of the Company;

provided,  however,  that  in  determining  whether  or not the  Holders  of the
requisite  principal amount of the Securities  Outstanding under this Indenture,
or the  Outstanding  Securities of any series,  have given any request,  demand,
authorization,  direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder or whether or not
a quorum is present at a meeting of Holders of Securities,  Securities  owned by
the Company or any other  obligor upon the  Securities  or any  Affiliate of the
Company or of such other  obligor  (unless the Company,  such  Affiliate or such
obligor owns all Securities Outstanding under this Indenture, or all Outstanding
Securities of each such series, as the case may be, determined without regard to
this provision)  shall be disregarded  and deemed not to be Outstanding,  except
that, in determining  whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any
such request,  demand,  authorization,  direction,  notice, consent or waiver or
upon any such

<PAGE>
                                     -5-

determination as to the presence of a quorum,  only Securities which the Trustee
knows to be so owned shall be so disregarded; provided, however, that Securities
so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if
the pledgee  establishes to the  satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right
so to act with  respect  to such  Securities  and that  the  pledgee  is not the
Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company
or of such  other  obligor;  and  provided,  further,  that,  in the case of any
Security the principal of which is payable from time to time without presentment
or surrender,  the principal  amount of such Security that shall be deemed to be
Outstanding at any time for all purposes of this Indenture shall be the original
principal  amount  thereof  less  the  aggregate  amount  of  principal  thereof
theretofore paid.

SECTION 102.  Compliance Certificates and Opinions.

               Except as otherwise  expressly  provided in this Indenture,  upon
any  application  or  request by the  Company to the  Trustee to take any action
under any provision of this  Indenture,  the Company shall,  if requested by the
Trustee,  furnish  to the  Trustee an  Officer's  Certificate  stating  that all
conditions  precedent,  if any,  provided for in this Indenture  relating to the
proposed action  (including any covenants  compliance  with which  constitutes a
condition  precedent)  have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating
that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent,  if any, have
been complied with,  except that in the case of any such  application or request
as to which the  furnishing of such  documents is  specifically  required by any
provision of this Indenture relating to such particular  application or request,
no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.

               Every  certificate  or opinion with respect to compliance  with a
condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include:

               (a) a statement  that each Person  signing  such  certificate  or
         opinion has read such covenant or condition and the definitions  herein
         relating thereto;

               (b)  a  brief  statement  as to  the  nature  and  scope  of  the
         examination  or  investigation  upon which the  statements  or opinions
         contained in such certificate or opinion are based;

<PAGE>
                                     -7-

         express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or 
         condition has been complied with; and

               (d) a  statement  as to  whether,  in the  opinion  of each  such
         Person, such condition or covenant has been complied with.

SECTION 103.  Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.

               In any case where  several  matters are  required to be certified
by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified  Person, it is not necessary that
all such  matters be  certified  by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
Person,  or that they be so certified or covered by only one  document,  but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion  with respect to some matters and one
or more other such Persons as to other matters,  and any such Person may certify
or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

               Any  certificate  or opinion of an officer of the  Company may be
based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of,
or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or  representations
with respect to the matters upon which such Officer's Certificate or opinion are
based are  erroneous.  Any such  certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based,
insofar as it relates to factual  matters,  upon a certificate or opinion of, or
representations  by, an officer or  officers  of the  Company  stating  that the
information  with respect to such factual  matters is in the  possession  of the
Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should
know,  that the certificate or opinion or  representations  with respect to such
matters are erroneous.

               Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications,  requests, consents,  certificates,  statements, opinions or other
instruments  under this Indenture,  they may, but need not, be consolidated  and
form one instrument.

               Whenever,  subsequent  to the receipt by the Trustee of any Board
Resolution,  Officer's  Certificate,  Opinion of Counsel  or other  document  or
instrument,  a clerical,  typographical  or other  inadvertent or  unintentional
error or omission shall be discovered  therein, a new document or instrument may
be  substituted  therefor in corrected form with the same force and effect as if
originally filed in the corrected form and, irrespective of the date or dates of
the actual  execution  and/or  delivery  thereof,  such  substitute  document or
instrument shall be deemed to have been executed and/or delivered as of the date
or dates  required  with respect to the document or  instrument  for which it is
substituted. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding,  if any
such corrective  document or instrument  indicates that action has been taken by
or at the  request  of the  Company  which  could  not have  been  taken had the
original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action
so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be
and remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that such action was a
result of willful  misconduct or bad faith.  Without  limiting the generality of
the  foregoing,  any  Securities  issued under the  authority of such  defective
document  or  instrument  shall  nevertheless  be the valid  obligations  of the

<PAGE>
                                     -8-

Company entitled to the benefits of this Indenture  equally and ratably with all
other Outstanding Securities, except as aforesaid.

SECTION 104.  Acts of Holders.

               (a)  Any  request,  demand,  authorization,   direction,  notice,
         consent, election, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to
         be made,  given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by
         one or more instruments of  substantially  similar tenor signed by such
         Holders  in  person  or by an  agent  duly  appointed  in  writing  or,
         alternatively,  may be  embodied  in and  evidenced  by the  record  of
         Holders  voting in favor  thereof,  either in person or by proxies duly
         appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders duly called and held in
         accordance with the provisions of Article Thirteen, or a combination of
         such  instruments  and any such  record.  Except  as  herein  otherwise
         expressly  provided,  such  action  shall  become  effective  when such
         instrument  or  instruments  or  record  or both are  delivered  to the
         Trustee and,  where it is hereby  expressly  required,  to the Company.
         Such  instrument  or  instruments  and any such  record (and the action
         embodied therein and evidenced  thereby) are herein sometimes  referred
         to as the "Act" of the Holders  signing such  instrument or instruments
         and so  voting  at any such  meeting.  Proof of  execution  of any such
         instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding
         by any Person of a  Security,  shall be  sufficient  for any purpose of
         this Indenture and (subject to Section 901)  conclusive in favor of the
         Trustee  and  the  Company,  if  made in the  manner  provided  in this
         Section.  The record of any  meeting of Holders  shall be proved in the
         manner provided in Section 1306.

               (b) The fact and date of the  execution by any Person of any such
         instrument  or writing may be proved by the  affidavit  of a witness of
         such  execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer
         authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the
         individual  signing such instrument or writing  acknowledged to him the
         execution  thereof  or may be  proved  in any  other  manner  which the
         Trustee and the Company deem  sufficient.  Where such execution is by a
         signer acting in a capacity  other than his individual  capacity,  such
         certificate or affidavit shall also constitute  sufficient proof of his
         authority.

               (c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Securities held by
         any Person,  and the date of holding  the same,  shall be proved by the
         Security Register.

               (d)  Any  request,  demand,  authorization,   direction,  notice,
         consent,  election,  waiver or other Act of a Holder  shall  bind every
         future  Holder of the same  Security  and the Holder of every  Security
         issued  upon  the  registration  of  transfer  thereof  or in  exchange
         therefor  or in lieu  thereof in respect of anything  done,  omitted or
         suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance  thereon,
         whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

               (e)  Until  such  time as  written  instruments  shall  have been
         delivered to the Trustee with respect to the  requisite  percentage  of
         principal  amount of  Securities  

<PAGE>
                                     -9-

         for the action  contemplated by such  instruments,  any such instrument
         executed and  delivered by or on behalf of a Holder may be revoked with
         respect  to any or all of such  Securities  by  written  notice by such
         Holder or any  subsequent  Holder,  proven in the  manner in which such
         instrument was proven.

               (f) Securities of any series  authenticated  and delivered  after
         any Act of Holders may,  and shall if required by the  Trustee,  bear a
         notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any action taken by such
         Act of Holders.  If the Company shall so determine,  new  Securities of
         any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and
         the Company, to such action may be prepared and executed by the Company
         and  authenticated  and  delivered  by  the  Trustee  in  exchange  for
         Outstanding Securities of such series.

               (g) If the  Company  shall  solicit  from  Holders  any  request,
         demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act,
         the Company  may,  at its option,  fix in advance a record date for the
         determination  of  Holders  entitled  to  give  such  request,  demand,
         authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the
         Company  shall have no  obligation  to do so. If such a record  date is
         fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
         waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date,  but
         only the  Holders of record at the close of business on the record date
         shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of  determining  whether
         Holders of the requisite proportion of the Outstanding  Securities have
         authorized   or  agreed  or   consented   to  such   request,   demand,
         authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for
         that  purpose the  Outstanding  Securities  shall be computed as of the
         record date.

SECTION 105.  Notices, etc. to Trustee and Company.

               Any request, demand,  authorization,  direction, notice, consent,
election,  waiver or Act of Holders or other  document  provided or permitted by
this  Indenture  to be made upon,  given or  furnished  to, or filed  with,  the
Trustee by any Holder or by the Company, or the Company by the Trustee or by any
Holder, shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein
expressly  provided)  if in writing and  delivered  personally  to an officer or
other  responsible  employee  of the  addressee,  or  transmitted  by  facsimile
transmission or other direct written  electronic  means to such telephone number
or other electronic communications address as the parties hereto shall from time
to time  designate,  or  transmitted  by certified or registered  mail,  charges

                       Telecopy:  (317)862-7307


               Any  communication  contemplated  herein  shall be deemed to have
been made, given,  furnished and filed if personally  delivered,  on the date of
delivery,  if  transmitted  by facsimile  transmission  or other direct  written
electronic means, on the date of transmission,  and if transmitted by registered
mail, on the date of receipt.

SECTION 106.  Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver.

               Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,   where  this
Indenture  provides  for notice to Holders of any event,  such  notice  shall be
sufficiently  given,  and shall be deemed  given,  to Holders if in writing  and
mailed,  first-class  postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at
the address of such  Holder as it appears in the  Security  Register,  not later
than the latest date,  if any, and not earlier than the earliest  date,  if any,
prescribed for the giving of such notice.

               In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by
reason  of any other  cause it shall be  impracticable  to give  such  notice to
Holders by mail,  then such  notification  as shall be made with the approval of
the  Trustee  shall  constitute  a  sufficient  notification  for every  purpose
hereunder.  In any case where  notice to Holders is given by mail,  neither  the
failure to mail such  notice,  nor any  defect in any  notice so mailed,  to any
particular  Holder shall affect the  sufficiency  of such notice with respect to
other Holders.

               Any notice required by this Indenture may be waived in writing by
the Person  entitled to receive  such notice,  either  before or after the event
otherwise to be specified  therein,  and such waiver shall be the  equivalent of
such notice.  Waivers of 

<PAGE>
                                     -11-

notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee,  but such filing shall not be
a condition  precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver.

SECTION 107.  Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

               If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts
with another provision hereof which is required or deemed to be included in this
Indenture  by, or is otherwise  governed by, any of the  provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act, such other provision shall control;  and if any provision  hereof
otherwise  conflicts with the Trust Indenture Act, the Trust Indenture Act shall
control, if applicable to this Indenture.

SECTION 108.  Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

               The Article and Section  headings in this Indenture and the Table
of  Contents  are for  convenience  only and shall not affect  the  construction
hereof.

SECTION 109.  Successors and Assigns.

               All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company and
Trustee shall bind their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed
or not.

SECTION 110.  Separability Clause.

               In case any provision in this Indenture or the  Securities  shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,  the validity, legality and enforceability
of the  remaining  provisions  shall  not in any  way be  affected  or  impaired
thereby.

SECTION 111.  Benefits of Indenture.

               Nothing in this Indenture or the Securities,  express or implied,
shall  give to any  Person,  other than the  parties  hereto,  their  successors
hereunder,  and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under this Indenture.

SECTION 112.  Governing Law.

               This  Indenture  and the  Securities  shall  be  governed  by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York,  except
to the  extent  that the law of any  other  jurisdiction  shall  be  mandatorily
applicable.

SECTION 113.  Legal Holidays.

               In any case where any Interest  Payment Date,  Redemption Date or
Stated  Maturity  of any  Security  shall not be a Business  Day at any Place of
Payment,  then  (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the
Securities  other than a provision in Securities of any series,  or in the Board
Resolution  or  Officer's   Certificate  which  establishes  the  terms  of  the
Securities of such series,  which specifically  states that such provision shall
apply in lieu of this Section) payment of interest or principal and premium,  if
any, need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date,  but may be 

<PAGE>
                                     -12-

made on the next succeeding  Business Day at such Place of Payment, in each case
with the same  force  and  effect,  and in the  same  amount,  as if made on the
Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, as the case
may be, and, if such payment is made or duly  provided for on such Business Day,
no interest  shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after
such Interest Payment Date,  Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may
be, to such Business Day.

SECTION 201.  Forms Generally.

               The   definitive   Securities   of  each   series   shall  be  in
substantially   the  form  or  forms  thereof   established   in  the  indenture
supplemental   hereto   establishing  such  series  or  in  a  Board  Resolution
establishing  such  series,  or in an  Officer's  Certificate  pursuant  to such
supplemental  indenture or Board Resolution,  in each case with such appropriate
insertions,  omissions,  substitutions  and other  variations as are required or
permitted by this Indenture,  and may have such letters,  numbers or other marks
of  identification  and such legends or  endorsements  placed  thereon as may be
required  to  comply  with  the  rules  of any  securities  exchange  or as may,
consistently  herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Securities,
as  evidenced  by their  execution  of the  Securities.  If the form or forms of
Securities  of  any  series  are  established  in a  Board  Resolution  or in an
Officer's Certificate pursuant to a Board Resolution,  such Board Resolution and
Officer's Certificate,  if any, shall be delivered to the Trustee at or prior to
the  delivery  of  the  Company  Order  contemplated  by  Section  303  for  the
authentication and delivery of such Securities.

multiple thereof.

SECTION 303.  Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.

               Unless  otherwise  provided as  contemplated  by Section 301 with
respect to any series of Securities,  the Securities shall be executed on behalf
of the Company by an Authorized  Officer and may have the corporate  seal of the
Company affixed thereto or reproduced  thereon  attested by any other Authorized
Officer or by the  Secretary  or an  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Company.  The
signature  of any or all of these  officers on the  Securities  may be manual or
facsimile.

               Securities   bearing  the  manual  or  facsimile   signatures  of
individuals  who  were  at the  time of  execution  Authorized  Officers  or the
Secretary  or an  Assistant  Secretary  of the Company  shall bind the  Company,
notwithstanding  that such  individuals  or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the  authentication  and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

               The  Trustee  shall  authenticate  and  deliver  Securities  of a
series,  for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance with
the Company Order referred to below, upon receipt by the Trustee of:

               (a) the instrument or instruments  establishing the form or forms
         and terms of such series, as provided in Sections 201 and 301;

               (b) a Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery of
         such  Securities  and, to the extent that the terms of such  Securities

         in a Board  Resolution,  or in an Officer's  Certificate  pursuant to a
         supplemental  indenture or Board  Resolution,  all as  contemplated  by
         Sections 201 and 301, establishing such terms;

<PAGE>
                                     -17-

               (c) the  Securities  of such  series,  executed  on behalf of the
         Company by an Authorized Officer;

               (d) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:

                    (i) the form or  forms of such  Securities  have  been  duly
               authorized by the Company and have been established in conformity
               with the provisions of this Indenture;

                    (ii) the terms of such  Securities have been duly authorized
               by the Company and have been  established in conformity  with the
               provisions of this Indenture; and

                    (iii) such Securities,  when  authenticated and delivered by
               the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company in the manner
               and  subject  to any  conditions  specified  in such  Opinion  of
               Counsel, will have been duly issued under this Indenture and will
               constitute valid and legally binding  obligations of the Company,
               entitled  to  the  benefits  provided  by  this  Indenture,   and
               enforceable  in  accordance  with  their  terms,  subject,  as to
               enforcement,  to laws  relating  to or  affecting  generally  the
               enforcement of creditors' rights, including,  without limitation,
               bankruptcy  and  insolvency  laws and to  general  principles  of
               equity  (regardless of whether such  enforceability is considered
               in a proceeding in equity or at law).

               If the form or terms of the  Securities  of any series  have been
established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or an Officer's  Certificate as
permitted  by  Sections  201 or  301,  the  Trustee  shall  not be  required  to
authenticate such Securities if the issuance of such Securities pursuant to this
Indenture will materially or adversely  affect the Trustee's own rights,  duties
or immunities  under the  Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner
which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to any series of  Securities,  each Security  shall be dated the date of
its authentication.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect  to any series of  Securities,  no  Security  shall be  entitled  to any
benefit under this  Indenture or be valid or obligatory  for any purpose  unless
there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication  substantially in
the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating  Agent
by manual signature,  and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive
evidence, and the only evidence,  that such Security has been duly authenticated
and  delivered  hereunder  and is  entitled to the  benefits of this  Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and
delivered  hereunder to the  Company,  or any Person  acting on its behalf,  but
shall never have been  issued and sold by the  Company,  and the  Company  shall
deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309
together  with a written  statement  (which need not comply with Section 102 and
need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has
never been issued and sold by the Company,  for all  


<PAGE>

                                     -18-
purposes of this  Indenture  such  Security  shall be deemed  never to have been
authenticated  and  delivered  hereunder  and  shall  never be  entitled  to the
benefits hereof.

SECTION 304.  Temporary Securities.

               Pending the  preparation of definitive  Securities of any series,
the Company may execute,  and upon Company Order the Trustee shall  authenticate
and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed,  typewritten,
mimeographed   or   otherwise   produced,   in  any   authorized   denomination,
substantially  of the tenor of the  definitive  Securities in lieu of which they
are issued, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other
variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced
by  their  execution  of such  Securities;  provided,  however,  that  temporary
Securities  need not recite  specific  redemption,  sinking fund,  conversion or
exchange provisions.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities of any series,  after the  preparation  of definitive
Securities  of such series,  the  temporary  Securities  of such series shall be
exchangeable, without charge to the Holder thereof, for definitive Securities of
such series upon surrender of such temporary  Securities at the office or agency
of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such
Securities.  Upon such surrender of temporary Securities for such exchange,  the
Company shall,  except as aforesaid,  execute and the Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver in exchange  therefor  definitive  Securities of the same series, of
authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.

               Until  exchanged in full as hereinabove  provided,  the temporary
Securities  of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this  Indenture as  definitive  Securities  of the same series and of like
tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder.

SECTION 305.  Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.

               The  Company  shall  cause to be kept in each  office  designated
pursuant to Section  602,  with  respect to the  Securities  of each  series,  a
register (all registers kept in accordance with this Section being  collectively
referred to as the  "Security  Register") in which,  subject to such  reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe,  the Company shall provide for the registration
of  Securities  of such series and the  registration  of transfer  thereof.  The
Company  shall  designate  one Person to maintain the Security  Register for the
Securities of each series on a consolidated  basis,  and such Person is referred
to herein,  with respect to such series, as the "Security  Registrar."  Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may designate one or more of
its offices as an office in which a register  with respect to the  Securities of
one or more series shall be maintained, and the Company may designate itself the
Security  Registrar  with  respect to one or more of such  series.  The Security
Register  shall be open for  inspection  by the  Trustee  and the Company at all
reasonable times.

               Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities of any series,  upon  surrender for  registration  of
transfer  of any  Security 

<PAGE>
                                     -19-

of such  series at the office or agency of the  Company  maintained  pursuant to
Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such series,  the Company  shall  execute,
and the Trustee shall  authenticate  and deliver,  in the name of the designated
transferee or  transferees,  one or more new  Securities of the same series,  of
authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.

               Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities  of any  series,  any  Security of such series may be
exchanged  at the option of the Holder,  for one or more new  Securities  of the
same  series,  of  authorized  denominations  and of like  tenor  and  aggregate
principal  amount,  upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such
office or agency.  Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange,  the
Company shall  execute,  and the Trustee  shall  authenticate  and deliver,  the
Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

               All  Securities  delivered upon any  registration  of transfer or
exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the
same debt,  and  entitled  to the same  benefits  under this  Indenture,  as the
Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

               Every  Security  presented or  surrendered  for  registration  of
transfer or for exchange  shall (if so required by the  Company,  the Trustee or
the Security  Registrar) be duly endorsed or shall be  accompanied  by a written
instrument of transfer in form  satisfactory to the Company,  the Trustee or the
Security  Registrar,  as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to  Securities  of any series,  no service  charge shall be made for any
registration of transfer or exchange of Securities,  but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge that
may be imposed in connection  with any  registration  of transfer or exchange of
Securities,  other  than  exchanges  pursuant  to Section  304,  406 or 1206 not
involving any transfer.

               The  Company  shall not be  required to execute or to provide for
the  registration of transfer of or the exchange of (a) Securities of any series
during a period of 15 days immediately  preceding the date of the mailing of any
notice  of  redemption  of such  Securities  called  for  redemption  or (b) any
Security so selected for  redemption in whole or in part,  except the unredeemed
portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

SECTION 306.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.

               If any  mutilated  Security is  surrendered  to the Trustee,  the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a new  Security  of the same  series,  and of like tenor and  principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

               If there  shall be  delivered  to the Company and the Trustee (a)
evidence to their satisfaction of the ownership of and the destruction,  loss or
theft of any  Security and (b) such  security or indemnity as may be  reasonably
required by them to save each of 

<PAGE>
                                     -20-

them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to
the Company or the Trustee that such Security is held by a Person  purporting to
be the owner of such  Security,  the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate  and  deliver,  in  lieu of any  such  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen
Security,  a new  Security of the same series,  and of like tenor and  principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

               Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  case  any  such  mutilated,
destroyed,  lost or stolen  Security  has  become or is about to become  due and
payable,  the Company in its discretion may,  instead of issuing a new Security,
pay such Security.

               Upon the issuance of any new  Security  under this  Section,  the
Company may require  the payment of a sum  sufficient  to cover any tax or other
governmental  charge  that may be  imposed  in  relation  thereto  and any other
reasonable  expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
therewith.

               Every new Security of any series issued  pursuant to this Section
in lieu of any destroyed,  lost or stolen Security shall  constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Company,  whether or not the destroyed,
lost or stolen  Security  shall be at any time  enforceable by anyone other than
the Holder of such new Security,  and any such new Security shall be entitled to
all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately  with any and all
other Securities of such series duly issued hereunder.

               The  provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall  preclude
(to the  extent  lawful)  all other  rights  and  remedies  with  respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

SECTION 307.  Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

               Unless  otherwise  specified as  contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to the  Securities  of any  series,  interest on any  Security  which is
payable,  and is punctually  paid or duly provided for, on any Interest  Payment
Date  shall be paid to the Person in whose  name that  Security  (or one or more
Predecessor  Securities)  is  registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest.

               Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable,  but
is not  punctually  paid or duly  provided  for, on any  Interest  Payment  Date
(herein called "Defaulted  Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
Holder on the related  Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder,
and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company,  at its election in each
case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:

               (a) The  Company  may  elect  to make  payment  of any  Defaulted
         Interest to the Persons in whose  names the  Securities  of such series
         (or their  respective  Predecessor  Securities)  are  registered at the
         close of business on a date (herein called a "Special Record Date") for
         the  payment of such  Defaulted  Interest,  which shall be fixed in the
         following  manner.  The Company  shall notify the Trustee in writing of
         the amount of Defaulted  Interest  proposed to be paid on each Security


<PAGE>
                                     -21-

         of such series and the date of the  proposed  payment,  and at the same
         time the  Company  shall  deposit  with the  Trustee an amount of money
         equal to the  aggregate  amount  proposed to be paid in respect of such
         Defaulted  Interest  or shall  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to the
         Trustee  for such  deposit  on or  prior  to the  date of the  proposed
         payment,  such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit
         of the Persons  entitled to such  Defaulted  Interest as in this clause
         provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the
         payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days
         and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and
         not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of
         the proposed payment.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of
         such  Special  Record  Date and,  in the name and at the expense of the
         Company,  shall promptly  cause notice of the proposed  payment of such
         Defaulted  Interest and the Special  Record Date therefor to be mailed,
         first-class  postage  prepaid,  to each  Holder of  Securities  of such
         series at the  address of such  Holder as it  appears  in the  Security
         Register,  not less than 10 days  prior to such  Special  Record  Date.
         Notice of the  proposed  payment  of such  Defaulted  Interest  and the
         Special  Record Date  therefor  having been so mailed,  such  Defaulted
         Interest  shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of
         such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered
         at the close of business on such Special Record Date.

               (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
         Securities  of any series in any other lawful  manner not  inconsistent
         with  the  requirements  of  any  securities  exchange  on  which  such
         Securities  may be listed,  and upon such  notice as may be required by
         such exchange,  if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of
         the proposed  payment  pursuant to this clause,  such manner of payment
         shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

               Subject to the  foregoing  provisions of this Section and Section
305, each Security  delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer
of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to
interest  accrued and unpaid,  and to accrue,  which were  carried by such other
Security.

SECTION 308.  Persons Deemed Owners.

               Prior  to due  presentment  of a  Security  for  registration  of
transfer,  the Company,  the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name such  Security is  registered as the absolute
owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving  payment of principal of and
premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such
Security and for all other purposes whatsoever,  whether or not such Security be
overdue,  and neither the  Company,  the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or
the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 309.  Cancellation by Security Registrar.

               All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption,  registration
of transfer or  exchange  shall,  if  surrendered  to any Person  other than the
Security  Registrar,  be  delivered  to  the  Security  Registrar  and,  if  not
theretofore canceled,  shall be promptly 

<PAGE>
                                     -22-

canceled by the Security  Registrar.  The Company may at any time deliver to the
Security Registrar for cancellation any Securities previously  authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever
or which the  Company  shall not have  issued and sold,  and all  Securities  so
delivered shall be promptly  canceled by the Security  Registrar.  No Securities
shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities  canceled as
provided in this Section,  except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.  All
canceled  Securities  held by the  Security  Registrar  shall be  disposed of in
accordance  with a Company  Order  delivered to the Security  Registrar  and the
Trustee,  and the Security  Registrar  shall  promptly  deliver a certificate of
disposition to the Trustee and the Company unless, by a Company Order, similarly
delivered,  the Company shall direct that canceled Securities be returned to it.
The Security  Registrar shall promptly deliver evidence of any cancellation of a
Security in accordance with this Section 309 to the Trustee and the Company.

SECTION 310.  Computation of Interest.

               Except as otherwise  specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities  of any series,  interest on the  Securities  of each series shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year  consisting  of twelve 30-day months and
for any period  shorter than a full month,  on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed in such period.


                                  ARTICLE FOUR

                            Redemption of Securities

SECTION 401.  Applicability of Article.

               Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated
Maturity  shall be  redeemable  in  accordance  with their  terms and (except as
otherwise  specified  as  contemplated  by Section  301 for  Securities  of such
series) in accordance with this Article.

SECTION 402.  Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

               The  election  of the Company to redeem any  Securities  shall be
evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate.  The Company shall,
at least 45 days prior to the  Redemption  Date fixed by the  Company  (unless a
shorter  notice shall be  satisfactory  to the  Trustee),  notify the Trustee in
writing of such Redemption  Date and of the principal  amount of such Securities
to be redeemed.  In the case of any  redemption of  Securities  (a) prior to the
expiration of any restriction on such  redemption  provided in the terms of such
Securities or elsewhere in this  Indenture or (b) pursuant to an election of the
Company  which  is  subject  to a  condition  specified  in the  terms  of  such
Securities,  the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate
evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.

                                     -23-

SECTION 403.  Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.

               If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed,
the  particular  Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from
the Outstanding  Securities of such series not previously called for redemption,
by such  method  as shall be  provided  for any  particular  series,  or, in the
absence of any such provision, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate  and which may provide for the selection for  redemption of portions
(equal to the minimum  authorized  denomination for Securities of such series or
any integral  multiple  thereof) of the  principal  amount of Securities of such
series of a denomination  larger than the minimum  authorized  denomination  for
Securities  of such  series;  provided,  however,  that if, as  indicated  in an
Officer's  Certificate,  the Company  shall have  offered to purchase all or any
principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding of any series, and less than
all of such  Securities as to which such offer was made shall have been tendered
to the Company for such purchase,  the Trustee, if so directed by Company Order,
shall select for redemption all or any principal amount of such Securities which
have not been so tendered.

               The Trustee  shall  promptly  notify the Company and the Security
Registrar in writing of the Securities  selected for redemption and, in the case
of any Securities  selected to be redeemed in part, the principal amount thereof
to be redeemed.

               For all purposes of this Indenture,  unless the context otherwise
requires,  all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate,
in the case of any  Securities  redeemed or to be redeemed  only in part, to the
portion of the principal  amount of such  Securities  which has been or is to be
redeemed.

SECTION 404.  Notice of Redemption.

               Notice of  redemption  shall be given in the manner  provided  in
Section 106 to the Holders of the Securities to be redeemed not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.

               All notices of redemption shall state:

               (a) the Redemption Date,

               (b) the Redemption Price,

               (c) if less  than  all the  Securities  of any  series  are to be
         redeemed,  the  identification  of  the  particular  Securities  to  be
         redeemed and the portion of the principal  amount of any Security to be
         redeemed in part,

               (d) that on the Redemption  Date the Redemption  Price,  together
         with accrued interest,  if any, to the Redemption Date, will become due
         and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if  applicable,
         that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,

<PAGE>
                                     -24-

               (e)  the  place  or  places  where  such  Securities  are  to  be
         surrendered for payment of the Redemption  Price and accrued  interest,
         if any,  unless it shall have been specified as contemplated by Section
         301 with respect to such  Securities  that such surrender  shall not be
         required,

               (f) that the  redemption  is for a sinking or other fund, if such
         is the case, and

               (g) such other  matters as the Company  shall deem  desirable  or
         appropriate.

               Unless  otherwise  specified  with respect to any  Securities  in
accordance  with  Section  301,  with  respect  to any notice of  redemption  of
Securities  at the  election  of the  Company,  unless,  upon the giving of such
notice,  such  Securities  shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance  with
Section 701,  such notice may state that such  redemption  shall be  conditional
upon the receipt by the Paying Agent or Agents for such Securities,  on or prior
to the date fixed for such redemption,  of money sufficient to pay the principal
of and premium,  if any, and interest,  if any, on such  Securities  and that if
such money shall not have been so received  such notice  shall be of no force or
effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such  Securities.  In the
event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is
not so received,  the redemption  shall not be made and within a reasonable time
thereafter  notice  shall be  given,  in the  manner  in  which  the  notice  of
redemption  was given,  that such money was not so received and such  redemption
was not required to be made,  and the Paying Agent or Agents for the  Securities
otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any
of such Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.

               Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election
of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of a condition for redemption
as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Security  Registrar  in the name and at the  expense of the  Company.  Notice of
mandatory  redemption of Securities shall be given by the Security  Registrar in
the name and at the expense of the Company.

SECTION 405.  Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

               Notice of  redemption  having  been given as  aforesaid,  and the
conditions,  if any,  set  forth  in such  notice  having  been  satisfied,  the
Securities or portions  thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date,
become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein  specified,  and from and
after such date (unless,  in the case of an unconditional  notice of redemption,
the Company  shall  default in the payment of the  Redemption  Price and accrued
interest,  if any) such  Securities or portions  thereof,  if  interest-bearing,
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption
in accordance  with such notice,  such Security or portion thereof shall be paid
by the Company at the Redemption Price,  together with accrued interest, if any,
to the Redemption  Date;  provided,  however,  that no such surrender shall be a
condition to such payment if so  specified as  contemplated  by Section 301 with
respect to such  Security;  and  provided,  further,  that  except as  otherwise
specified  as  contemplated  by Section 301 with

<PAGE>
                                     -25-

respect to such Security, any installment of interest on any Security the Stated
Maturity of which installment is on or prior to the  Redemption  Date  shall be
payable to the Holder of such Security, or one or more Predecessor Securities,
registered as such at the close of business on the related  Regular Record Date
according to the terms of such Security and subject to the provisions of Section
307.

SECTION 406.  Securities Redeemed in Part.

               Upon the  surrender of any Security  which is to be redeemed only
in part at a Place of Payment  therefor  (with, if the Company or the Trustee so
requires,  due  endorsement  by, or a written  instrument  of  transfer  in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof
or his attorney duly authorized in writing),  the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall  authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security,  without
service  charge,  a new  Security  or  Securities  of the  same  series,  of any
authorized  denomination  requested  by such  Holder  and of like  tenor  and in
aggregate  principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed  portion
of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

                                  ARTICLE FIVE

                                  Sinking Funds

SECTION 501.  Applicability of Article.

               The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking
fund for the  retirement of the  Securities  of any series,  except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

               The minimum  amount of any sinking fund  payment  provided for by
the terms of  Securities  of any series is herein  referred  to as a  "mandatory
sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided
for by the  terms of  Securities  of any  series  is  herein  referred  to as an
"optional  sinking fund payment".  If provided for by the terms of Securities of
any  series,  the cash  amount of any  sinking  fund  payment  may be subject to
reduction as provided in Section 502. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied
to the redemption of Securities of the series in respect of which it was made as
provided for by the terms of such Securities.

SECTION 502.  Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.

               The Company (a) may deliver to the Trustee Outstanding Securities
(other  than any  previously  called for  redemption)  of a series in respect of
which a  mandatory  sinking  fund  payment  is to be made and (b) may apply as a
credit Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election
of the  Company  pursuant  to the  terms  of  such  Securities  or  through  the
application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of
such Securities or Outstanding Securities purchased by the Company, in each case
in satisfaction  of all or any part of such mandatory  sinking fund payment with
respect to the Securities of such series; provided,  however, that no Securities
shall be applied in  satisfaction  of a mandatory  sinking  fund payment if such

<PAGE>
                                     -26-

Securities shall have been previously so applied. Securities so applied shall be
received and credited  for such purpose by the Trustee at the  Redemption  Price
specified in such  Securities  for redemption  through  operation of the sinking
fund and the amount of such  mandatory  sinking  fund  payment  shall be reduced
accordingly.

SECTION 503.  Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.

               Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for
the  Securities  of any  series,  the  Company  shall  deliver to the Trustee an
Officer's Certificate specifying:

               (a) the  amount of the next  succeeding  mandatory  sinking  fund
         payment for such series;

               (b) the amount,  if any, of the optional  sinking fund payment to
         be made together with such mandatory sinking fund payment;

               (c) the aggregate sinking fund payment;

               (d) the portion,  if any, of such aggregate  sinking fund payment
         which is to be satisfied by the payment of cash; and

               (e) the portion,  if any, of such aggregate  sinking fund payment
         which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of such
         series  pursuant  to Section  502 and stating the basis for such credit
         and that such Securities have not previously been so credited,  and the
         Company  shall also  deliver to the  Trustee  any  Securities  to be so
         delivered. If the Company shall not deliver such Officer's Certificate,
         the next succeeding  sinking fund payment for such series shall be made
         entirely in cash in the amount of the  mandatory  sinking fund payment.
         Not less than 30 days before each such  sinking  fund  payment date the
         Trustee  shall select the  Securities  to be redeemed upon such sinking
         fund  payment  date in the manner  specified  in Section  403 and cause
         notice of the redemption  thereof to be given in the name of and at the
         expense of the  Company in the manner  provided  in Section  404.  Such
         notice having been duly given,  the redemption of such Securities shall
         be made upon the terms and in the  manner  stated in  Sections  405 and
         406.


                                   ARTICLE SIX

SECTION 601.  Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.

                       The Company  shall pay the  principal of and premium,  if
      any, and interest,  if any, on the Securities of each series in accordance
      with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.

<PAGE>
                                     -27-

SECTION 602.  Maintenance of Office or Agency.

               The  Company  shall  maintain  in each Place of  Payment  for the
Securities of each series an office or agency where  payment of such  Securities
shall be made, where the registration of transfer or exchange of such Securities
may be effected and where  notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect
of such  Securities  and this  Indenture  may be served.  The Company shall give
prompt  written  notice to the  Trustee of the  location,  and any change in the
location,  of each such office or agency and prompt notice to the Holders of any
such change in the manner  specified  in Section 106. If at any time the Company
shall  fail to  maintain  any such  required  office  or agency  in  respect  of
Securities of any series,  or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address
thereof,  payment of such Securities shall be made,  registration of transfer or
exchange  thereof may be effected and notices and demands in respect thereof may
be served at the Corporate  Trust Office of the Trustee,  and the Company hereby
appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes in any such event.

               The  Company  may also  from time to time  designate  one or more
other offices or agencies with respect to the  Securities of one or more series,
for any or all of the foregoing  purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations;   provided,   however,   that,   unless  otherwise   specified  as
contemplated  by Section 301 with respect to the  Securities of such series,  no
such  designation  or rescission  shall in any manner relieve the Company of its
obligation  to maintain  an office or agency for such  purposes in each Place of
Payment for such Securities in accordance with the requirements set forth above.
The Company shall give prompt written  notice to the Trustee,  and prompt notice
to the Holders in the manner  specified in Section 106, of any such  designation
or  rescission  and of any change in the  location  of any such other  office or
agency.

               Anything  herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,  any office or
agency  required by this Section may be  maintained at an office of the Company,
in which event the Company  shall  perform all functions to be performed at such
office or agency.

SECTION 603.  Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.

               If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with
respect to the Securities of any series, it shall, on or before each due date of
the  principal of and  premium,  if any,  and  interest,  if any, on any of such
Securities,  segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto a sum  sufficient  to pay the  principal  and  premium  or  interest  so
becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein  provided.  The Company  shall  promptly  notify the Trustee of any
failure by the Company  (or any other  obligor on such  Securities)  to make any
payment of  principal  of or  premium,  if any,  or  interest,  if any,  on such
Securities.

               Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for the
Securities of any series,  it shall, on or before each due date of the principal
of and premium, if any, and interest,  if any, on such Securities,  deposit with
such Paying Agents sums  sufficient  (without  duplication) to pay the principal
and premium or interest  so becoming  due,  such sum to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Persons  entitled to such  

<PAGE>
                                     -28-

principal,  premium or  interest,  and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee)
the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure by it so to act.

               The Company  shall cause each Paying Agent for the  Securities of
any series, other than the Company or the Trustee, to execute and deliver to the
Trustee an  instrument  in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee,
subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent shall:

               (a) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the  principal of
         and premium,  if any, or interest,  if any, on such Securities in trust
         for the benefit of the Persons  entitled  thereto until such sums shall
         be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

               (b) give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or any
         other obligor upon such Securities) to make any payment of principal of
         or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Securities; and

               (c) at any time during the continuance of any such default,  upon
         the written  request of the Trustee,  forthwith  pay to the Trustee all
         sums so held in trust by such  Paying  Agent and furnish to the Trustee
         such  information as it possesses  regarding the names and addresses of
         the Persons entitled to such sums.

               The Company may at any time pay, or by Company  Order  direct any
Paying  Agent to pay,  to the  Trustee  all sums held in trust by the Company or
such Paying  Agent,  such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as
those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent and, if
so stated in a Company Order  delivered to the Trustee,  in accordance  with the
provisions of Article  Seven;  and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Trustee,  such Paying Agent shall be released  from all further  liability  with
respect to such money.

               Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then
held by the Company,  in trust for the payment of the  principal of and premium,
if any, or interest,  if any, on any Security and  remaining  unclaimed  for two
years after such  principal and premium,  if any, or interest has become due and
payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or, if then held by the
Company,  shall be  discharged  from  such  trust;  and,  upon such  payment  or
discharge,  the Holder of such Security shall, as an unsecured  general creditor
and not as a Holder of an  Outstanding  Security,  look only to the  Company for
payment of the amount so due and payable and remaining unpaid, and all liability
of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with  respect to such trust  money,  and all
liability of the Company as trustee thereof,  shall thereupon  cease;  provided,
however,  that the Trustee or such Paying Agent,  before being  required to make
any such payment to the Company,  may at the expense of the Company  cause to be
mailed,  on one  occasion  only,  notice to such Holder that such money  remains
unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than
30 days from the date of such mailing,  any unclaimed balance of such money then
remaining will be paid to the Company.

however,   that  nothing  in  this  Section   shall  prevent  the  Company  from
discontinuing,  or causing the  discontinuance of, the operation and maintenance

Company, desirable in the conduct of its business.

SECTION 606.  Annual Officer's Certificate as to Compliance.

Securities  of all series with respect to which  compliance  with Section 602 or
such  additional  covenant or  restriction  is to be omitted,  considered as one
class,  shall,  by Act of such  Holders,  either waive such  compliance  in such
instance or generally waive  compliance  with such term,  provision or condition
and (b)  Section  604,  605 or  Article  Eleven  if  before  the  time  for such
compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal  amount of Securities
Outstanding  under this Indenture  shall,  by Act of such Holders,  either waive
such compliance in such instance or generally  waive  compliance with such term,
provision  or  condition;  but, in the case of (a) or (b), no such waiver  shall
extend to or affect such term,  provision or  condition  except to the extent so
expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations

                           Satisfaction and Discharge

SECTION 701.  Defeasance.

               Any  Security  or  Securities,  or any  portion of the  principal
amount  thereof,  shall be deemed to have  been  paid for all  purposes  of this
Indenture,  and the entire  indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof shall
be  deemed to have been  satisfied  and  discharged,  if there  shall  have been
irrevocably  deposited  with the  Trustee or any Paying  Agent  (other  than the
Company), in trust:

               (a) money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or

               (b) in the case of a deposit  made prior to the  Maturity of such
         Securities or portions thereof, Government Obligations, which shall not
         contain  provisions  permitting  the  redemption  or  other  prepayment
         thereof at the option of the issuer  thereof,  the principal of and the
         interest on which when due, without any regard to reinvestment thereof,
         will provide moneys which,  together with the money, if any,  deposited
         with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent,  shall be sufficient,
         or

               (c) a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient,

to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest,  if any, due
and to  become  due on such  Securities  or  portions  thereof  on or  prior  to
Maturity;  provided,  however,  that in the case of the provision for payment or
redemption  of less than all the  Securities of any series,  such  Securities or
portions thereof shall have been selected by the Trustee as provided herein and,
in the case of a  redemption,  the  notice  requisite  to the  validity  of such
redemption shall have been given or irrevocable  authority shall have been given
by  the  Company  to  the  Trustee  to  give  such  notice,  under  arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided,  further, that the Company shall have
delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent:

                    (x) if such  deposit  shall  have  been  made  prior  to the
               Maturity of such  Securities,  a Company  Order  stating that the
               money and  Government  Obligations  deposited in accordance  with
               this Section shall be held in trust,  as provided in Section 703;
               and

                    (y) if Government Obligations shall have been deposited,  an
               Opinion of Counsel that the  obligations so deposited  constitute
               Government  Obligations and do not contain provisions  permitting
               the  redemption  or other  prepayment at the option of the issuer
               thereof,  and an opinion of an independent  public  accountant of
               nationally  recognized standing,  selected by the Company, to the
               effect that the  requirements  set forth in clause (b) above have
               been satisfied; and

<PAGE>
                                     -31-

                    (z) if such  deposit  shall  have  been  made  prior  to the
               Maturity of such Securities, an Officer's Certificate stating the
               Company's   intention  that,  upon  delivery  of  such  Officer's
               Certificate,  its  indebtedness  in respect of such Securities or
               portions  thereof  will have been  satisfied  and  discharged  as
               contemplated in this Section.

               Upon the deposit of money or Government Obligations,  or both, in
accordance  with this Section,  together with the documents  required by clauses
(x), (y) and (z) above,  the Trustee shall,  upon receipt of a Company  Request,
acknowledge in writing that the Security or Securities or portions  thereof with
respect  to which  such  deposit  was made are  deemed to have been paid for all
purposes of this  Indenture and that the entire  indebtedness  of the Company in
respect  thereof has been  satisfied  and  discharged  as  contemplated  in this
Section.  In the event  that all of the  conditions  set forth in the  preceding
paragraph  shall have been  satisfied in respect of any  Securities  or portions
thereof  except that,  for any reason,  the Officer's  Certificate  specified in
clause (z) shall not have been delivered,  such  Securities or portions  thereof
shall  nevertheless  be  deemed  to have  been  paid  for all  purposes  of this
Indenture,  and the  Holders  of  such  Securities  or  portions  thereof  shall
nevertheless  be no longer  entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or of any
of the  covenants  of the  Company  under  Article  Six  (except  the  covenants
contained  in Sections  602 and 603) or any other  covenants  made in respect of
such  Securities  or portions  thereof as  contemplated  by Section 301, but the
indebtedness  of the Company in respect of such  Securities or portions  thereof
shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged  prior to Maturity for
any other purpose,  and the Holders of such Securities or portions thereof shall
continue to be  entitled to look to the Company for payment of the  indebtedness
represented thereby; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall acknowledge in
writing that such  Securities  or portions  thereof are deemed to have been paid
for all purposes of this Indenture.

               If payment at Stated  Maturity of less than all of the Securities
of any series is to be provided  for in the manner and with the effect  provided
in this  Section,  the  Security  Registrar  shall  select such  Securities,  or
portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 403 for
selection for redemption of less than all the Securities of a series.

               In the event that  Securities  which shall be deemed to have been
paid for  purposes of this  Indenture,  and, if such is the case,  in respect of
which the Company's  indebtedness shall have been satisfied and discharged,  all
as provided in this Section do not mature and are not to be redeemed  within the
60 day period  commencing  with the date of the deposit of moneys or  Government
Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a
notice,  in the same  manner  as a notice of  redemption  with  respect  to such
Securities,  to the Holders of such  Securities  to the effect that such deposit
has been made and the effect thereof.

               Notwithstanding  that any Securities shall be deemed to have been
paid for  purposes of this  Indenture,  as  aforesaid,  the  obligations  of the
Company and the Trustee in respect of such  Securities  under Sections 304, 305,
306,  404,  503 (as to notice of  redemption),  602,  603,  907 and 915 and this
Article Seven shall survive.

               The Company  shall pay,  and shall  indemnify  the Trustee or any
Paying  Agent with which  Government  Obligations  shall have been  deposited as
provided in this Section  against,  any tax,  fee or other charge  imposed on or
assessed  against  such  Government  Obligations  or the  principal  or interest
received in respect of such Government Obligations,  including,  but not limited
to, any such tax payable by any entity  deemed,  for tax purposes,  to have been
created as a result of such deposit.

               Anything herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,  (a) if, at any
time after a  Security  would be deemed to have been paid for  purposes  of this
Indenture,  and,  if such is the case,  the  Company's  indebtedness  in respect
thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied or  discharged,  pursuant to this
Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any
Paying  Agent,  as the case may be,  shall be  required  to return  the money or
Government Obligations,  or combination thereof,  deposited with it as aforesaid
to the  Company  or its  representative  under any  applicable  Federal or State
bankruptcy,  insolvency or other similar law, such Security  shall  thereupon be
deemed retroactively not to have been paid and any satisfaction and discharge of
the Company's  indebtedness in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not
to have been effected,  and such Security shall be deemed to remain  Outstanding
and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's  indebtedness in respect
of any  Security  shall be subject to the  provisions  of the last  paragraph of
Section 603.

SECTION 702.  Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.

               This Indenture  shall upon Company Request cease to be of further
effect  (except as  hereinafter  expressly  provided),  and the Trustee,  at the
expense  of  the  Company,   shall  execute  proper  instruments   acknowledging
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when

               (a) no Securities remain Outstanding hereunder; and

               (b) the  Company  has paid or caused  to be paid all  other  sums
         payable hereunder by the Company;

provided,  however,  that if, in accordance  with the last  paragraph of Section
701,  any  Security,  previously  deemed to have been paid for  purposes of this
Indenture,  shall  be  deemed  retroactively  not to  have  been so  paid,  this
Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and
discharged,  as  aforesaid,  and to remain in full  force  and  effect,  and the
Company  shall  execute  and  deliver  such  instruments  as the  Trustee  shall
reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same.

               Notwithstanding  the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture
as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee under Sections 304,
305, 306, 404, 503 (as to notice of redemption),  602, 603, 907 and 915 and this
Article Seven shall survive.

               Upon  satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as provided in
this Section,  the Trustee shall assign,  transfer and turn over to the Company,
subject to the lien provided by Section 907, any and all money,  securities  and
other  property  then held

by the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities  other than
money and Government Obligations held by the Trustee pursuant to Section 703.

SECTION 703.  Application of Trust Money.

               Neither  the  Government  Obligations  nor  the  money  deposited
pursuant to Section  701,  nor the  principal  or interest  payments on any such
Government  Obligations,  shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than,
and shall be held in trust for, the payment of the principal of and premium,  if
any, and interest,  if any, on the  Securities  or portions of principal  amount
thereof in respect of which such deposit was made, all subject,  however, to the
provisions of Section 603; provided,  however,  that, so long as there shall not
have  occurred and be continuing an Event of Default any cash received from such
principal  or interest  payments  on such  Government  Obligations,  if not then
needed for such  purpose,  shall,  to the extent  practicable,  be  invested  in
Government  Obligations  of the  type  described  in  clause  (b)  in the  first
paragraph  of Section 701 maturing at such times and in such amounts as shall be
sufficient to pay when due the  principal of and premium,  if any, and interest,
if any,  due and to become due on such  Securities  or  portions  thereof on and
prior to the Maturity thereof,  and interest earned from such reinvestment shall
be paid over to the Company as  received,  free and clear of any trust,  lien or
pledge  under this  Indenture  except the lien  provided  by  Section  907;  and
provided,  further,  that,  so long as  there  shall  not have  occurred  and be
continuing an Event of Default,  any moneys held in accordance with this Section
on the Maturity of all such  Securities in excess of the amount  required to pay
the  principal of and premium,  if any, and  interest,  if any, then due on such
Securities  shall be paid over to the Company free and clear of any trust,  lien
or pledge  under this  Indenture  except the lien  provided by Section  907; and
provided,  further,  that if an Event of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing, moneys to be paid over to the Company pursuant to this Section shall
be held until such Event of Default shall have been waived or cured.

SECTION 802.  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.

               If an Event of Default due to the default in payment of principal
of, or  interest  on,  any  series of  Securities  or due to the  default in the
performance  or  breach  of any  other  covenant  or  warranty  of  the  Company
applicable  to  the  Securities  of  such  series  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing,  either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal
amount of the  Securities  of such series may then declare the  principal of all
Securities  of such series and  interest  accrued  thereon to be due and payable
immediately.  If an Event of Default  specified  in Section  801(d) or (e) shall
have  occurred  and  be  continuing,   the  principal  of  all  Securities  then
Outstanding   and  interest   accrued  thereon  shall  become  due  and  payable
immediately.

               At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect
to Securities of any series shall have been made and before a judgment or decree
for  payment  of the money  due  shall  have been  obtained  by the  Trustee  as
hereinafter in this Article provided, the Event or Events of Default giving rise
to such  declaration of acceleration  may be waived by the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding,
and such declaration and its consequences shall,  without further act, be deemed
to have been rescinded and annulled, if

               (a) the Company  shall have paid or deposited  with the Trustee a
         sum sufficient to pay

                    (1) all overdue interest on all Securities of such series;

                    (2) the principal of and premium,  if any, on any Securities
               of such  series  which  have  become due  otherwise  than by such
               declaration of acceleration  and interest  thereon at the rate or
               rates prescribed therefor in such Securities;

                    (3) to the extent that  payment of such  interest is lawful,
               interest  upon  overdue  interest,  if any,  at the rate or rates
               prescribed therefor in such Securities;

                    (4) all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907;

               and

               (b) any  other  Event  or  Events  of  Default  with  respect  to
         Securities of such series,  other than the  nonpayment of the principal
         of Securities of such series which shall have become due solely by such
         declaration  of  acceleration,  shall  have  been  cured or  waived  as
         provided in Section 813.

               No such rescission  shall affect any subsequent  Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 803.  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.

               If an Event of Default  described in clause (a) or (b) of Section
801 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the
Trustee,  pay to it, for the  benefit of the  Holders of the  Securities  of the
series  with  respect to which such Event of Default  shall have  occurred,  the
whole amount then due and payable on such  Securities for principal and premium,
if any, and interest,  if any, and, to the extent permitted by law,  interest on
premium, if any, and on any overdue principal and interest, at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Securities,  and, in addition thereto,  such further
amount as shall be  sufficient  to cover any amounts  due to the  Trustee  under
Section 907.

               If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such
demand,  the Trustee,  in its own name and as trustee of an express  trust,  may
institute  a  judicial  proceeding  for the  collection  of the  sums so due and
unpaid,  may  prosecute  such  proceeding  to judgment  or final  decree and may
enforce the same against the Company or any other  obligor upon such  Securities
and collect the moneys  adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided
by law out of the  property  of the  Company  or any  other  obligor  upon  such
Securities, wherever situated.

               If an Event of Default with respect to  Securities  of any series
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed
to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of
such series by such appropriate  judicial  proceedings as the Trustee shall deem
most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,  whether for the specific
enforcement  of any  covenant or  agreement  in this  Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

SECTION 804.  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

               In  case  of  the  pendency  of  any  receivership,   insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial  proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities  or the  property  of the  Company or of such other  obligor or their
creditors,  the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
shall  then be due  and  payable  as  therein  expressed  or by  declaration  or
otherwise and  irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on
the Company for the payment of overdue  principal or interest) shall be entitled
and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

               (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of  principal,
         premium,  if any, and interest,  if any, owing and unpaid in respect of
         the  Securities  and to file such other  papers or  documents as may be
         necessary  or  advisable  in order to have the  claims  of the  Trustee
         (including  any claim for amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907)
         and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

               (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other  property  payable
         or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

<PAGE>
                                     -37-

and any custodian,  receiver,  assignee,  trustee,  liquidator,  sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial  proceeding is hereby  authorized by
each  Holder to make such  payments  to the  Trustee  and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to
pay to the Trustee any amounts due it under Section 907.

               Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee
to  authorize  or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan
of  reorganization,   arrangement,   adjustment  or  composition  affecting  the
Securities  or the rights of any Holder  thereof or to authorize  the Trustee to
vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 805.  Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.

               All  rights of action  and claims  under  this  Indenture  or the
Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee  without the possession
of any of the  Securities or the production  thereof in any proceeding  relating
thereto,  and any such proceeding  instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in
its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,
after  provision  for the  payment  of the  reasonable  compensation,  expenses,
disbursements  and advances of the Trustee,  its agents and counsel,  be for the
ratable  benefit of the  Holders in  respect  of which  such  judgment  has been
recovered.

SECTION 806.  Application of Money Collected.

               Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall
be applied in the  following  order,  at the date or dates  fixed by the Trustee
and,  in case of the  distribution  of such  money on account  of  principal  or
premium,  if any, or interest,  if any, upon  presentation  of the Securities in
respect  of which or for the  benefit  of  which  such  money  shall  have  been
collected  and the notation  thereon of the payment if only  partially  paid and
upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

               First:  To the  payment  of all  amounts  due the  Trustee  under
         Section 907;

               Second:  To the payment of the  amounts  then due and unpaid upon
         the Securities for principal of and premium,  if any, and interest,  if
         any,  in  respect  of which or for the  benefit of which such money has
         been collected,  ratably,  without  preference or priority of any kind,
         according  to the  amounts  due  and  payable  on such  Securities  for
         principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, respectively; and

               Third: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or
         to  whomsoever  may be  lawfully  entitled  to receive the same or as a
         court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

SECTION 807.  Limitation on Suits.

               No Holder  shall  have any  right to  institute  any  proceeding,
judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of
a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

               (a) such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the
         Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities
         of such series;

               (b)  the  Holders  of not  less  than  a  majority  in  aggregate
         principal  amount  of the  Outstanding  Securities  of such  series  in
         respect  of which  an  Event of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
         continuing  shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute
         proceedings  in  respect  of such  Event of  Default in its own name as
         Trustee hereunder;

               (c) such  Holder or  Holders  shall have  offered to the  Trustee
         reasonable indemnity against the costs,  expenses and liabilities to be
         incurred in compliance with such request;

               (d) the  Trustee  for 60 days after its  receipt of such  notice,
         request and offer of indemnity  shall have failed to institute any such
         proceeding; and

               (e) no direction  inconsistent  with such written  request  shall
         have been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders
         of  a  majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Outstanding
         Securities  of all series in respect of which an Event of Default shall
         have occurred and be continuing, considered as one class;

it being  understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner  whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this  Indenture to affect,  disturb or  prejudice  the rights of any other of
such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain  priority or preference  over any
other of such  Holders or to enforce any right under this  Indenture,  except in
the manner herein  provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such
Holders.

SECTION 808.  Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal,
              Premium and Interest.

               Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder
of any Security shall have the right,  which is absolute and  unconditional,  to
receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section
307)  interest,  if any, on such  Security on the Stated  Maturity or Maturities
expressed in such Security  (or, in the case of  redemption,  on the  Redemption
Date) and to institute suit for the  enforcement  of any such payment,  and such
rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 809.  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

               If the Trustee or any Holder has  instituted  any  proceeding  to
enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding  shall have
been  discontinued  or abandoned for any reason,  or shall have been  determined
adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject
to any  determination  in such  proceeding,  the  Company,  and Trustee and such
Holder shall be restored  severally and  respectively to their former  positions
hereunder and  thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and such Holder
shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

SECTION 810.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

               Except as  otherwise  provided in the last  paragraph  of Section
306, no right or remedy herein  conferred  upon or reserved to the Trustee or to
the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy,  and every
right and remedy shall,  to the extent  permitted by law, be  cumulative  and in
addition to every other right and remedy  given  hereunder  or now or  hereafter
existing at law or in equity or  otherwise.  The  assertion or employment of any
right or remedy  hereunder,  or  otherwise,  shall not  prevent  the  concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 811.  Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

               No delay or  omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise
any right or remedy  accruing  upon any Event of Default  shall  impair any such
right or  remedy  or  constitute  a waiver of any such  Event of  Default  or an
acquiescence therein.  Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to
the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised  from time to time,  and as often
as may be deemed  expedient,  by the Trustee or by the Holders,  as the case may
be.

SECTION 812.  Control by Holders of Securities.

               If an Event of Default  shall have  occurred and be continuing in
respect  of a series of  Securities,  the  Holders of a  majority  in  aggregate
principal  amount of the  Outstanding  Securities  of such series shall have the
right to direct the time,  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy  available to the Trustee,  or exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series;  provided,  however,
that if an Event of Default shall have  occurred and be continuing  with respect
to more than one series of  Securities,  the Holders of a majority in  aggregate
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all such series, considered as
one class,  shall have the right to make such direction,  and not the Holders of
the  Securities  of any one of such series;  and  provided,  further,  that such
direction  shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture.
Before  proceeding to exercise any right or power  hereunder at the direction of
such  Holders,  the  Trustee  shall be  entitled  to receive  from such  Holders
reasonable  security or indemnity  against the costs,  expenses and  liabilities
which might be incurred by it in compliance with any such direction.

SECTION 813.  Waiver of Past Defaults.

               The  Holders of not less than a majority in  aggregate  principal
amount of the Outstanding  Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders
of all the  Securities  of such series  waive any past  default  hereunder  with
respect to such series and its consequences, except a default

               (a) in the payment of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any, or
         interest, if any, on any Security of such series, or

               (b) in respect of a covenant  or  provision  hereof  which  under
         Section  1202 cannot be modified or amended  without the consent of the
         Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

               Upon any such waiver,  such default shall cease to exist, and any
and all Events of Default arising  therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured,
for every  purpose of this  Indenture;  but no such waiver  shall  extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 814.  Undertaking for Costs.

               The  Company  and the  Trustee  agree,  and  each  Holder  by his
acceptance  thereof  shall be deemed to have  agreed,  that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this  Indenture,  or in any suit  against  the  Trustee  for any  action  taken,
suffered or omitted by it as Trustee,  the filing by any party  litigant in such
suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in
its discretion assess reasonable costs,  including  reasonable  attorneys' fees,
against  any party  litigant  in such suit,  having due regard to the merits and
good  faith of the  claims or  defenses  made by such  party  litigant;  but the
provisions  of this  Section  shall  not  apply  to any suit  instituted  by the
Company,  to any suit  instituted by the Trustee,  to any suit instituted by any
Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of which
such suit may be brought,  considered as one class, or to any suit instituted by
any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if
any, or  interest,  if any, on any  Security on or after the Stated  Maturity or
Maturities  expressed in such  Security  (or, in the case of  redemption,  on or
after the Redemption Date).

SECTION 815.  Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

               The Company  covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so)
that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner  whatsoever
claim or take the benefit or advantage  of, any stay or  extension  law wherever
enacted,  now or at any time hereafter in force,  which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law
and  covenants  that it will not hinder,  delay or impede the  execution  of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

                                   The Trustee

SECTION 901.  Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

               (a) Upon receipt of a notice from the Company that this Indenture
         is subject to the Trust  Indenture  Act, the Trustee  shall have and be
         subject to all the duties and  responsibilities  specified with respect
         to an indenture trustee in the Trust Indenture Act. Prior to receipt of
         any such notice, the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only
         such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. No implied
         covenants or obligations  shall be read into this Indenture against the
         Trustee.

               (b) No provision of this  Indenture  shall require the Trustee to
         expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability
         in the performance of any of its duties  hereunder,  or in the exercise
         of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for
         believing  that repayment of such funds or adequate  indemnity  against
         such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

               (c)  Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Indenture to the
         contrary and whether or not this Indenture is qualified under the Trust
         Indenture  Act, the duties and  responsibilities  of the Trustee  under
         this Indenture shall be subject to the  protections,  exculpations  and
         limitations on liability  afforded to a trustee under the provisions of
         the Trust Indenture Act.

               (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision
         of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of
         or  affording  protection  to  the  Trustee  shall  be  subject  to the
         provisions of this Section.

SECTION 902.  Notice of Defaults.

               The  Trustee  shall give  notice of any  default  hereunder  with
respect to the  Securities  of any series to the Holders of  Securities  of such
series in the manner and to the extent  required to do so by the Trust Indenture
Act,  unless such default  shall have been cured or waived;  provided,  however,
that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 801(c), no
such  notice  to  Holders  shall be given  until  at  least  45 days  after  the
occurrence  thereof.  For the purpose of this Section,  the term "default" means
any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become,  an
Event of Default.

SECTION 903.  Certain Rights of Trustee.

               Subject to the  provisions  of Section 901 and to the  applicable
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act:

               (a) the  Trustee  may rely and  shall be  protected  in acting or

         debenture,  note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or 
         document  reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been 
         signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

         Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;

               (c) whenever in the  administration of this Indenture the Trustee
         shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to
         taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless
         other evidence be herein  specifically  prescribed) may, in the absence
         of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officer's Certificate;

               (d) the Trustee may consult with  counsel and the written  advice
         of such  counsel or any Opinion of Counsel  shall be full and  complete

               (e) the Trustee  shall be under no  obligation to exercise any of
         the rights or powers  vested in it by this  Indenture at the request or
         direction of any Holder pursuant to this Indenture,  unless such Holder
         shall have  offered to the Trustee  reasonable  security  or  indemnity
         against the costs,  expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by
         it in compliance with such request or direction;

               (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into
         the facts or matters stated in any resolution,  certificate, statement,
         instrument,  opinion,  report,  notice,  request,  direction,  consent,
         order, bond,  debenture,  note, other evidence of indebtedness or other
         paper or document,  but the Trustee,  in its discretion,  may make such
         further inquiry or  investigation  into such facts or matters as it may
         see fit,  and,  if the Trustee  shall  determine  to make such  further
         inquiry  or  investigation,  it  shall  (subject  to  applicable  legal
         requirements) be entitled to examine, during normal business hours, the
         books,  records and premises of the Company,  personally or by agent or
         attorney;

         misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed
         with due care by it hereunder; and

               (h) the  Trustee  shall  not be  charged  with  knowledge  of any
         default or Event of Default,  as the case may be,  with  respect to the
         Securities  of any  series  for which it is acting  as  Trustee  unless
         either (1) a  Responsible  Officer  of the  Trustee  shall have  actual
         knowledge  of the default or Event of  Default,  as the case may be, or
         (2) written notice of such default or Event of Default, as the case may

                                     -43-

         be,  shall have been given to the  Trustee  by the  Company,  any other
         obligor on such Securities or by any Holder of such Securities.

SECTION 904.  Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.

               The recitals  contained herein and in the Securities  (except the
Trustee's  certificates of  authentication)  shall be taken as the statements of
the  Company,  and  neither the Trustee  nor any  Authenticating  Agent  assumes
responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to

any other capacity,  may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and,  subject
to Sections  908 and 913,  may  otherwise  deal with the  Company  with the same
rights it would have if it were not the Trustee,  Authenticating  Agent,  Paying
Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.

benefit of, the Company.

SECTION 907.  Compensation and Reimbursement.

               The Company shall

               (a) pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable  compensation
         for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not
         be limited by any provision of law in regard to the  compensation  of a
         trustee of an express trust);

               (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein,  reimburse the
         Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and

         any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable  compensation
         and the expenses and  disbursements of its agents and counsel),  except
         to the extent  that any such  expense,  disbursement  or advance may be
         attributable  to the  Trustee's  negligence,  wilful  misconduct or bad
         faith; and

               (c)  indemnify  the Trustee  for,  and hold it harmless  from and
         against,  any loss,  liability  or expense  reasonably  incurred  by it
         arising out of or in connection  with the acceptance or  administration
         of the trust or  trusts  hereunder  or the  performance  of its  duties
         hereunder,  including  the  reasonable  costs and expenses of 

<PAGE>
                                     -44-

         defending  itself against any claim or liability in connection with the
         exercise  or  performance  of any of its  powers or  duties  hereunder,
         except  to the  extent  any such  loss,  liability  or  expense  may be
         attributable to its negligence,  wilful misconduct, bad faith or breach
         of its obligations under this Indenture.

               As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company
under this Section,  the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities  upon
all  property  and funds  held or  collected  by the  Trustee as such other than
property and funds held in trust under Section 703 (except as otherwise provided
in Section  703).  "Trustee"  for  purposes of this  Section  shall  include any
predecessor Trustee; provided,  however, that the negligence,  wilful misconduct
or bad faith of any Trustee  hereunder  shall not affect the rights of any other
Trustee hereunder.

               In addition to the rights provided to the Trustee pursuant to the
provisions of the immediately  preceding paragraph of this Section 907, when the
Trustee  incurs  expenses  or renders  services in  connection  with an Event of
Default specified in Section 801(d) or Section 801(e),  the expenses  (including
the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the
services  are  intended  to  constitute  expenses  of  administration  under any
applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.

SECTION 908.  Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.

               If the  Trustee  shall have or acquire any  conflicting  interest
within the meaning of the Trust  Indenture  Act, it shall either  eliminate such
conflicting interest or resign to the extent, in the manner and with the effect,
and  subject to the  conditions,  provided in the Trust  Indenture  Act and this
Indenture.  For purposes of Section  310(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act and to
the extent permitted thereby, the Trustee, in its capacity as trustee in respect
of the  Securities  of any  series,  shall not be  deemed to have a  conflicting
interest  arising from its capacity as trustee in respect of the  Securities  of
any other series.

SECTION 909.  Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

               There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be

               (a) a corporation  organized and doing business under the laws of
         the United  States,  any State or Territory  thereof or the District of
         Columbia,  authorized  under  such  laws to  exercise  corporate  trust
         powers,  having a combined capital and surplus of at least  $50,000,000
         and  subject  to   supervision  or  examination  by  Federal  or  State
         authority, or

               (b) if and to the extent  permitted  by the  Commission  by rule,
         regulation or order upon  application,  a  corporation  or other Person
         organized and doing  business  under the laws of a foreign  government,
         authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a
         combined  capital  and  surplus of at least  $50,000,000  or the Dollar
         equivalent  of  the   applicable   foreign   currency  and  subject  to
         supervision or examination by authority of such foreign government or a

<PAGE>
                                     -45-

         political subdivision thereof  substantially  equivalent to supervision
         or examination applicable to United States institutional trustees,

and, in either case,  qualified  and  eligible  under this Article and the Trust
Indenture  Act. If such  corporation  publishes  reports of  condition  at least
annually,  pursuant  to  law or to  the  requirements  of  such  supervising  or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital
and surplus of such  corporation  shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.  If at
any  time  the  Trustee  shall  cease  to be  eligible  in  accordance  with the
provisions of this Section,  it shall resign  immediately in the manner and with
the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

SECTION 910.  Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

               (a) No  resignation  or removal of the Trustee and no appointment
         of a successor  Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective
         until  the  acceptance  of  appointment  by the  successor  Trustee  in
         accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 911.

               (b) The  Trustee  may  resign  at any time  with  respect  to the
         Securities of one or more series by giving  written  notice  thereof to
         the Company.  If the  instrument of  acceptance by a successor  Trustee
         required  by Section 911 shall not have been  delivered  to the Trustee
         within 30 days  after the  giving of such  notice of  resignation,  the
         resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent  jurisdiction for
         the  appointment of a successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities
         of such series.

               (c) The  Trustee  may be removed at any time with  respect to the
         Securities  of  any  series  by Act of the  Holders  of a  majority  in
         principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered
         to the Trustee and to the Company.

               (d) If at any time:

                    (1) the Trustee  shall fail to comply with Section 908 after
         written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a
         bona fide Holder for at least six months, or

                    (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 909
         and shall fail to resign after written request  therefor by the Company
         or by any such Holder, or

                    (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be
         adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
         property  shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or
         control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
         rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then,  in any such case,  (x) the Company by a Board  Resolution  may remove the
Trustee with respect to all Securities or (y) subject to Section 814, any Holder
who has been a 

<PAGE>
                                     -46-

bona fide  Holder for at least six  months  may,  on behalf of  himself  and all
others similarly situated,  petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities  and the  appointment of a
successor Trustee or Trustees.

               (e) If the Trustee shall resign,  be removed or become  incapable
         of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any
         cause (other than as  contemplated  in clause (y) in subsection  (d) of
         this  Section),  with respect to the  Securities of one or more series,
         the Company, by a Board Resolution,  shall promptly appoint a successor
         Trustee or Trustees  with  respect to the  Securities  of that or those
         series (it being  understood  that any such  successor  Trustee  may be
         appointed  with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such
         series  and that at any time  there  shall  be only  one  Trustee  with
         respect to the  Securities of any  particular  series) and shall comply
         with the  applicable  requirements  of Section 911. If, within one year
         after such resignation,  removal or incapability,  or the occurrence of
         such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any
         series  shall be  appointed  by Act of the  Holders  of a  majority  in
         principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered
         to the Company  and the  retiring  Trustee,  the  successor  Trustee so
         appointed  shall,  forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
         accordance with the applicable  requirements of Section 911, become the
         successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to
         that extent supersede the successor  Trustee  appointed by the Company.
         If no successor  Trustee with respect to the  Securities  of any series
         shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted
         appointment  in the manner  required by Section 911, any Holder who has
         been a bona fide  Holder of a Security  of such series for at least six
         months  may,  on behalf of itself  and all others  similarly  situated,
         petition any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the appointment of a
         successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

               (f) So long as no event  which  is,  or after  notice or lapse of
         time, or both,  would  become,  an Event of Default shall have occurred
         and be  continuing,  and except with respect to a Trustee  appointed by
         Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
         Securities  pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section,  if the Company
         shall have delivered to the Trustee (i) a Board Resolution appointing a
         successor Trustee,  effective as of a date specified therein,  and (ii)
         an instrument of acceptance of such  appointment,  effective as of such
         date, by such  successor  Trustee in  accordance  with Section 911, the
         Trustee shall be deemed to have resigned as  contemplated in subsection
         (b) of this Section, the successor Trustee shall be deemed to have been
         appointed by the Company pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section and
         such appointment  shall be deemed to have been accepted as contemplated
         in Section 911, all as of such date,  and all other  provisions of this
         Section  and  Section  911  shall be  applicable  to such  resignation,
         appointment and acceptance except to the extent  inconsistent with this
         subsection (f).

               (g) The Company  shall give notice of each  resignation  and each
         removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and
         each appointment of a successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities
         of any series by mailing  written 

<PAGE>
                                     -47-

         notice of such  event by  first-class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to all
         Holders  of  Securities  of such  series as their  names and  addresses
         appear in the Security Register.  Each notice shall include the name of
         the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and
         the address of its corporate trust office.

SECTION 911.  Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

               (a) In case of the appointment  hereunder of a successor  Trustee
         with  respect to the  Securities  of all series,  every such  successor
         Trustee so  appointed  shall  execute,  acknowledge  and deliver to the
         Company  and to the  retiring  Trustee  an  instrument  accepting  such
         appointment,  and thereupon the  resignation or removal of the retiring
         Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,  without any
         further  act,  deed or  conveyance,  shall  become  vested with all the
         rights,  powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the
         request of the Company or the successor Trustee,  such retiring Trustee
         shall,  upon  payment of all sums owed to it,  execute  and  deliver an
         instrument  transferring  to such  successor  Trustee  all the  rights,
         powers  and  trusts of the  retiring  Trustee  and shall  duly  assign,
         transfer and deliver to such  successor  Trustee all property and money
         held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

               (b) In case of the appointment  hereunder of a successor  Trustee
         with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the
         Company,  the retiring Trustee and each successor  Trustee with respect
         to the  Securities  of one or more series shall  execute and deliver an
         indenture  supplemental  hereto  wherein each  successor  Trustee shall
         accept such  appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as
         shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest
         in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of
         the retiring  Trustee with respect to the  Securities  of that or those
         series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates,  (2)
         if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities,
         shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable
         to  confirm  that all the  rights,  powers,  trusts  and  duties of the
         retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series
         as to which the retiring  Trustee is not retiring  shall continue to be
         vested in the  retiring  Trustee  and (3) shall add to or change any of
         the  provisions of this  Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for
         or facilitate the  administration  of the trusts hereunder by more than
         one  Trustee,  it  being  understood  that  nothing  herein  or in such
         supplemental  indenture shall  constitute such Trustees  co-trustees of
         the same trust and that each such  Trustee  shall be trustee of a trust
         or  trusts  hereunder  separate  and  apart  from any  trust or  trusts
         hereunder  administered  by  any  other  such  Trustee;  and  upon  the
         execution and delivery of such  supplemental  indenture the resignation
         or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent
         provided therein and each such successor  Trustee,  without any further
         act,  deed or  conveyance,  shall  become  vested  with all the rights,
         powers,  trusts and duties of the retiring  Trustee with respect to the
         Securities  of that or those  series to which the  appointment  of such
         successor  Trustee  relates;  but,  on  request  of the  Company or any
         successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee, upon payment of all sums owed
         to it,  shall duly  assign,  transfer  and  deliver  to such  successor
         Trustee 

<PAGE>
                                     -48-

         all property and money held by such retiring Trustee  hereunder
         with  respect to the  Securities  of that or those  series to which the
         appointment of such successor Trustee relates.

               (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
         execute  any  instruments  which  fully  vest  in and  confirm  to such
         successor  Trustee all such  rights,  powers and trusts  referred to in
         subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

               (d) No successor  Trustee shall accept its appointment  unless at
         the time of such acceptance  such successor  Trustee shall be qualified
         and eligible under this Article.

SECTION 912.  Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.

               Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted
or with which it may be  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting  from any
merger,  conversion or  consolidation  to which the Trustee shall be a party, or
any  corporation  succeeding to all or  substantially  all the  corporate  trust
business  of the  Trustee,  shall be the  successor  of the  Trustee  hereunder,
provided such corporation  shall be otherwise  qualified and eligible under this
Article,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of any of the  parties  hereto.  In case any  Securities  shall  have  been
authenticated,  but not delivered,  by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger,  conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such  authentication  and deliver the Securities so authenticated  with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

SECTION 913.  Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

               If the  Trustee  shall be or become a creditor  of the Company or
any other obligor upon the  Securities  (other than by reason of a  relationship
described in Section  311(b) of the Trust  Indenture  Act), the Trustee shall be
subject  to any  and  all  applicable  provisions  of the  Trust  Indenture  Act
regarding the  collection of claims  against the Company or such other  obligor.
For purposes of Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act:

               (a) the term "cash  transaction"  means any  transaction in which
         full  payment for goods or  securities  sold is made within  seven days
         after  delivery of the goods or  securities in currency or in checks or
         other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand;

               (b) the term  "self-liquidating  paper" means any draft,  bill of
         exchange,  acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or
         incurred  by the Company for the  purpose of  financing  the  purchase,
         processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or
         merchandise  and which is secured  by  documents  evidencing  title to,
         possession of, or a lien upon,  the goods,  wares or

<PAGE>
                                     -49-

         merchandise or the receivables  or proceeds  arising from the sale of
         the goods,  wares or merchandise previously constituting the security,
         provided the security is  received  by the Trustee simultaneously with
         the  creation of the creditor  relationship  with  the Company arising
         from  the  making, drawing,  negotiating  or  incurring  of the draft,
         bill of  exchange, acceptance or obligation.

SECTION 914.  Co-trustees and Separate Trustees.

               At any time or  times,  for the  purpose  of  meeting  the  legal
requirements of any applicable  jurisdiction,  the Company and the Trustee shall
have power to appoint,  and,  upon the written  request of the Trustee or of the
Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Securities then  Outstanding,
the Company  shall for such purpose join with the Trustee in the  execution  and
delivery of all instruments and agreements  necessary or proper to appoint,  one
or more Persons  approved by the Trustee  either to act as  co-trustee,  jointly
with the Trustee, or to act as separate trustee, in either case with such powers
as may be provided in the instrument of appointment,  and to vest in such Person
or Persons,  in the capacity  aforesaid,  any  property,  title,  right or power
deemed necessary or desirable,  subject to the other provisions of this Section.
If the  Company  does not join in such  appointment  within  15 days  after  the
receipt  by it of a  request  so to do,  or if an Event of  Default  shall  have
occurred  and be  continuing,  the  Trustee  alone shall have power to make such
appointment.

               Should any written  instrument or instruments from the Company be
required  by any  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee so  appointed  to more fully
confirm to such co-trustee or separate  trustee such property,  title,  right or
power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged
and delivered by the Company.

               Every  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee  shall,  to  the  extent
permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following
conditions:

               (a) the Securities shall be authenticated and delivered,  and all
         rights,  powers,  duties and  obligations  hereunder  in respect of the
         custody of  securities,  cash and other  personal  property held by, or
         required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustee hereunder,  shall
         be exercised solely, by the Trustee;

               (b) the rights,  powers,  duties and obligations hereby conferred
         or imposed upon the Trustee in respect of any property  covered by such
         appointment  shall  be  conferred  or  imposed  upon and  exercised  or
         performed  either by the Trustee or by the Trustee and such  co-trustee
         or separate  trustee  jointly,  as shall be provided in the  instrument
         appointing  such co-trustee or separate  trustee,  except to the extent
         that under any law of any  jurisdiction  in which any particular act is
         to be performed,  the Trustee shall be  incompetent  or  unqualified to
         perform  such act,  in which  event  such  rights,  powers,  duties and
         obligations  shall be exercised  and  performed by such  co-trustee  or
         separate trustee;

<PAGE>
                                     -50-

               (c) the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed
         by it, with the concurrence of the Company,  may accept the resignation
         of or remove any co-trustee or separate  trustee  appointed  under this
         Section,  and,  if an Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
         continuing,  the Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of,
         or  remove,  any  such  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee  without  the
         concurrence  of the Company.  Upon the written  request of the Trustee,
         the Company  shall join with the Trustee in the  execution and delivery
         of all  instruments  and  agreements  necessary or proper to effectuate
         such resignation or removal.  A successor to any co-trustee or separate
         trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner  provided
         in this Section;

               (d)  no  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee   hereunder  shall  be
         personally  liable by reason of any act or omission of the Trustee,  or
         any other such trustee hereunder; and

               (e) any Act of Holders  delivered to the Trustee  shall be deemed
         to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.

SECTION 915.  Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

               The Trustee may  appoint an  Authenticating  Agent or Agents with
respect to the  Securities  of one or more series,  which shall be authorized to
act on behalf of the Trustee to  authenticate  Securities  of such series issued
upon original  issuance and upon exchange,  registration  of transfer or partial
redemption  thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so  authenticated
shall be  entitled  to the  benefits  of this  Indenture  and shall be valid and
obligatory  for all  purposes  as if  authenticated  by the  Trustee  hereunder.
Wherever  reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery
of  Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's  certificate  of  authentication,
such reference shall be deemed to include  authentication and delivery on behalf
of the Trustee by an  Authenticating  Agent and a certificate of  authentication
executed  on  behalf  of  the   Trustee  by  an   Authenticating   Agent.   Each
Authenticating  Agent shall be  acceptable to the Company and shall at all times
be a  corporation  organized  and doing  business  under the laws of the  United
States,  any State or territory thereof or the District of Columbia,  authorized
under such laws to act as  Authenticating  Agent,  having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than  $50,000,000  and subject to supervision or examination
by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of
condition  at least  annually,  pursuant to law or to the  requirements  of said
supervising or examining  authority,  then for the purposes of this Section, the
combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating  Agent shall be deemed to be
its  combined  capital  and  surplus as set forth in its most  recent  report of
condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section,  such Authenticating
Agent shall resign  immediately  in the manner and with the effect  specified in
this Section.

               Any corporation into which an Authenticating  Agent may be merged
or converted or with which it may be consolidated,  or any corporation resulting

merger,  conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be
a party,  or any  corporation  succeeding to the  corporate  agency or corporate
trust   business  of  an   Authenticating   Agent,   shall  continue  to  be  an
Authenticating  Agent,  provided such  corporation  shall be otherwise  eligible
under this Section,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

               An Authenticating  Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice  thereof to the Trustee and to the  Company.  The Trustee may at any time
terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof
to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation  or  upon  such  a  termination,   or  in  case  at  any  time  such
Authenticating  Agent  shall  cease  to  be  eligible  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of this Section,  the Trustee may appoint a successor  Authenticating
Agent which shall be  acceptable to the Company.  Any  successor  Authenticating
Agent upon acceptance of its appointment  hereunder shall become vested with all
the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder,  with like effect as
if originally  named as an  Authenticating  Agent.  No successor  Authenticating
Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

               The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating  Agent from time
to time  reasonable  compensation  for its services under this Section,  and the
Trustee  shall be entitled to be  reimbursed  for such  payments,  in accordance
with, and subject to the provisions of Section 907.

               The  provisions  of Sections 308, 904 and 905 shall be applicable
to each Authenticating Agent.

               If an  appointment  with respect to the Securities of one or more
series shall be made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may
have   endorsed   thereon,   in  addition  to  the  Trustee's   certificate   of
authentication,  an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the
following form:

               This is one of the  Securities of the series  designated  therein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

         Section 911(b); or

               (i) to provide for the procedures  required to permit the Company

         herein, or to make any other changes to the provisions hereof or to add
         other  provisions  with respect to matters or questions  arising  under

               into an indenture  supplemental hereto to evidence such amendment
               hereof.

SECTION 1202.  Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.

<PAGE>
                                     -56-

considered as one class, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the
Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may
enter into an indenture  or  indentures  supplemental  hereto for the purpose of
adding any provisions  to, or changing in any manner or  eliminating  any of the
provisions  of,  this  Indenture  or  modifying  in any manner the rights of the
Holders of Securities  of such series under the  Indenture;  provided,  however,
that if there shall be Securities of more than one series Outstanding  hereunder
and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the
Holders of  Securities of one or more,  but less than all, of such series,  then
the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of
the Outstanding Securities of all series so directly affected, considered as one
class,  shall be required;  and  provided,  further,  that no such  supplemental
indenture shall:

               (a)  change  the  Stated  Maturity  of the  principal  of, or any
         installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the
         principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon (or the amount
         of any  installment  of  interest  thereon)  or  change  the  method of
         calculating such rate or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption
         thereof,  or change the coin or currency (or other property),  in which
         any  Security or any  premium or the  interest  thereon is payable,  or
         impair  the right to  institute  suit for the  enforcement  of any such
         payment on or after the Stated  Maturity  of any  Security  (or, in the
         case of redemption,  on or after the Redemption Date),  without, in any
         such case, the consent of the Holder of such Security, or

               (b) reduce the percentage in principal  amount of the Outstanding
         Securities  of any  series,  the  consent  of the  Holders  of which is
         required  for any such  supplemental  indenture,  or the consent of the
         Holders  of which is  required  for any waiver of  compliance  with any
         provision  of  this  Indenture  or of any  default  hereunder  and  its
         consequences,  or reduce the requirements of Section 1304 for quorum or
         voting,  without,  in any such case, the consent of the Holders of each
         Outstanding Security of such series, or

               (c) modify any of the provisions of this Section,  Section 607 or
         Section 813 with  respect to the  Securities  of any series,  except to
         increase  the  percentages  in  principal  amount  referred  to in this
         Section or such other  Sections or to provide that other  provisions of
         this Indenture  cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the
         Holder  of  each  Outstanding  Security  affected  thereby;   provided,
         however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of
         any Holder with respect to changes in the  references  to "the Trustee"
         and  concomitant  changes  in this  Section,  or the  deletion  of this
         proviso,  in accordance  with the  requirements  of Sections 911(b) and
         1201(h).

A  supplemental  indenture  which  changes or  eliminates  any covenant or other
provision of this  Indenture  which has expressly  been included  solely for the
benefit of one or more  particular  series of Securities,  or which modifies the
rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant
or other  provision,  shall be  deemed  not to  affect  the  rights  under  this
Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.

<PAGE>
                                     -57-

               It shall  not be  necessary  for any Act of  Holders  under  this
Section to approve the particular form of any proposed  supplemental  indenture,
but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall  approve the substance  thereof.  A
waiver by a Holder of such Holder's right to consent under this Section shall be
deemed to be a consent of such Holder.

SECTION 1203.  Execution of Supplemental Indentures.

               In executing,  or accepting the additional trusts created by, any
supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of
the trusts created by this Indenture,  the Trustee shall be entitled to receive,
and  (subject  to Section  901) shall be fully  protected  in relying  upon,  an
Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental  indenture is
authorized  or  permitted by this  Indenture.  The Trustee may, but shall not be
obligated  to,  enter into any such  supplemental  indenture  which  affects the
Trustee's own rights, duties,  immunities or liabilities under this Indenture or
otherwise.

SECTION 1204.  Effect of Supplemental Indentures.

               Upon the  execution  of any  supplemental  indenture  under  this
Article,  this  Indenture  shall be modified in accordance  therewith,  and such
supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and
every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered
hereunder shall be bound thereby.  Any supplemental  indenture permitted by this
Article may restate this Indenture in its entirety,  and, upon the execution and
delivery  thereof,  any such  restatement  shall  supersede  this  Indenture  as
theretofore in effect for all purposes.

SECTION 1205.  Conformity With Trust Indenture Act.

               Every  supplemental  indenture  executed pursuant to this Article
shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.

SECTION 1206.  Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.

               Securities of any series  authenticated  and delivered  after the
execution of any supplemental  indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall
if required by the Trustee,  bear a notation in form  approved by the Trustee as
to any matter provided for in such supplemental  indenture. If the Company shall
so determine,  new  Securities  of any series so modified as to conform,  in the
opinion of the Trustee and the Company,  to any such supplemental  indenture may
be prepared and executed by the Company and  authenticated  and delivered by the
Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.

                                     -58-

SECTION 1207.  Modification Without Supplemental Indenture.

               If the terms of any  particular  series of Securities  shall have
been  established  in  a  Board  Resolution  or  an  Officer's   Certificate  as
contemplated  by  Section  301,  and not in an  indenture  supplemental  hereto,
additions to, changes in or the elimination of any of such terms may be effected
by means of a supplemental  Board  Resolution or Officer's  Certificate,  as the
case may be, delivered to, and accepted by, the Trustee; provided, however, that
such  supplemental  Board  Resolution  or  Officer's  Certificate  shall  not be
accepted by the Trustee or  otherwise  be effective  unless all  conditions  set
forth  in this  Indenture  which  would  be  required  to be  satisfied  if such
additions,  changes or elimination  were  contained in a supplemental  indenture
shall have been  appropriately  satisfied.  Upon the  acceptance  thereof by the
Trustee,  any such supplemental Board Resolution or Officer's  Certificate shall
be deemed to be a  "supplemental  indenture"  for  purposes of Section  1204 and
1206.

SECTION 1304.  Quorum; Action.

amount of the  Outstanding  Securities  of the  series  with  respect to which a
meeting  shall have been  called as  hereinbefore  provided,  considered  as one
class,  shall constitute a quorum for a meeting of Holders of Securities of such
series;  provided,  however,  that if any action is to be taken at such  meeting
which  this  Indenture  expressly  provides  may be  taken by the  Holders  of a
specified percentage,  which is less than a majority, in principal amount of the
Outstanding  Securities  of such series,  considered  as one class,  the Persons
entitled  to  vote  such  specified   percentage  in  principal  amount  of  the

a quorum.  In the absence of a quorum within one hour of the time  appointed for
any such meeting,  the meeting  shall,  if convened at the request of Holders of
Securities of such series,  be  dissolved.  In any other case the meeting may be
adjourned  for such period as may be  determined  by the chairman of the meeting
prior to the adjournment of such meeting. In the absence of a quorum at any such
adjourned  meeting,  such  adjourned  meeting may be further  adjourned for such
period  as may be  determined  by the  chairman  of  the  meeting  prior  to the
adjournment of such adjourned  meeting.  Except as provided by Section  1305(e),
notice of the  reconvening of any meeting  adjourned for more than 30 days shall

<PAGE>
                                     -60-

provided  above, of the principal  amount of the Outstanding  Securities of such
series which shall constitute a quorum.

               Except as limited by Section 1202, any resolution  presented to a
meeting or  adjourned  meeting duly  reconvened  at which a quorum is present as
aforesaid  may be  adopted  only by the  affirmative  vote of the  Holders  of a
majority in aggregate  principal  amount of the  Outstanding  Securities  of the
series with respect to which such meeting shall have been called,  considered as
one class;  provided,  however,  that, except as so limited, any resolution with
respect to any action which this  Indenture  expressly  provides may be taken by
the  Holders  of a  specified  percentage,  which is less  than a  majority,  in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, considered as one
class,  may be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned  meeting duly reconvened and
at which a quorum is present as aforesaid by the affirmative vote of the Holders
of such specified  percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding  Securities
of such series, considered as one class.

               Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of Holders
of Securities  duly held in accordance with this Section shall be binding on all
the Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such meeting shall
have been held, whether or not present or represented at the meeting.

SECTION 1305.  Attendance at Meetings; Determination of Voting Rights;
               Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings.

               (a)  Attendance  at meetings of Holders of  Securities  may be in
         person or by proxy; and, to the extent permitted by law, any such proxy
         shall  remain in effect  and be binding  upon any future  Holder of the
         Securities  with  respect  to  which  it was  given  unless  and  until
         specifically  revoked by the Holder or future Holder of such Securities
         before being voted.

               (b) Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this Indenture,  the
         Trustee may make such  reasonable  regulations as it may deem advisable
         for any  meeting  of Holders  of  Securities  in regard to proof of the
         holding of such  Securities  and of the  appointment  of proxies and in
         regard to the  appointment  and  duties  of  inspectors  of votes,  the
         submission and examination of proxies,  certificates and other evidence
         of the right to vote, and such other matters  concerning the conduct of
         the meeting as it shall deem appropriate. Except as otherwise permitted
         or required by any such regulations, the holding of Securities shall be
         proved in the manner  specified in Section 104 and the  appointment  of
         any proxy shall be proved in the manner  specified in Section 104. Such
         regulations may provide that written  instruments  appointing  proxies,
         regular on their face,  may be presumed  valid and genuine  without the
         proof specified in Section 104 or other proof.

               (c) The Trustee  shall,  by an instrument  in writing,  appoint a
         temporary  chairman of the meeting,  unless the meeting shall have been
         called by the Company or by Holders as provided in Section 1302(b),  in
         which case the  Company  or the  Holders  of  Securities  of the series
         calling the meeting, as the case 

<PAGE>
                                     -61-

         may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman.  A permanent
         chairman and a permanent  secretary of the meeting  shall be elected by
         vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in aggregate  principal
         amount of the Outstanding  Securities of all series  represented at the
         meeting, considered as one class.

               (d) At any meeting  each Holder or proxy shall be entitled to one
         vote for each $1 principal  amount of Securities held or represented by
         him;  provided,  however,  that no vote shall be cast or counted at any
         meeting in respect of any Security  challenged as not  Outstanding  and
         ruled  by the  chairman  of the  meeting  to be  not  Outstanding.  The
         chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote, except as a Holder
         of a Security or proxy.

               (e) Any meeting  duly called  pursuant to Section 1302 at which a
         quorum  is  present  may be  adjourned  from  time to  time by  Persons
         entitled  to vote a  majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of the
         Outstanding  Securities  of all  series  represented  at  the  meeting,
         considered  as one class;  and the meeting may be held as so  adjourned
         without further notice.

SECTION 1306.  Counting Votes and Recording Action of Meetings.

               The vote upon any resolution  submitted to any meeting of Holders
shall be by written  ballots on which shall be subscribed  the signatures of the
Holders  or of their  representatives  by proxy and the  principal  amounts  and
serial  numbers of the  Outstanding  Securities,  of the series with  respect to
which the meeting  shall have been  called,  held or  represented  by them.  The
permanent  chairman of the meeting  shall  appoint two  inspectors  of votes who
shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any  resolution and who
shall make and file with the  secretary of the meeting  their  verified  written
reports of all votes cast at the meeting.  A record of the  proceedings  of each
meeting of Holders  shall be prepared by the  secretary of the meeting and there
shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes
on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having
knowledge  of the facts  setting  forth a copy of the notice of the  meeting and
showing  that said  notice  was  given as  provided  in  Section  1302  and,  if
applicable,  Section  1304.  Each  copy  shall be  signed  and  verified  by the
affidavits of the  permanent  chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such
copy  shall be  delivered  to the  Company,  and  another  to the  Trustee to be
preserved by the Trustee,  the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted
at the meeting.  Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive  evidence
of the matters therein stated.

SECTION 1307.  Action Without Meeting.

               In  lieu  of a vote  of  Holders  at a  meeting  as  hereinbefore
contemplated in this Article,  any request,  demand,  authorization,  direction,
notice,  consent,  waiver or other action may be made, given or taken by Holders
by written instruments as provided in Section 104.

<PAGE>

                                    GUARANTEE
                                       OF
                         MINNESOTA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY


                  For  value  received,  Minnesota  Power  &  Light  Company,  a
corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Minnesota
(herein called the "Guarantor"),  hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees to
the  Trustee  under  the  Indenture,  dated as of May 15,  1996,  between  ADESA
Corporation (the "Company") and The Bank of New York, as Trustee  (together with
any amendments thereto, the "Indenture"),  the payment of the obligations of the
Company under the  Securities of the First Series and the Indenture  relating to
such series, including,  without limitation, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of and premium,  if any, and interest on the  Securities  of the First
Series when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity or
upon redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, according to the terms thereof
and of the  Indenture.  In case of the failure of the Company  punctually to pay
any such principal, premium, if any, or interest, the Guarantor hereby agrees to
cause any such payment to be made  punctually  when and as the same shall become
due and payable,  whether at maturity or upon redemption or upon  declaration or
otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company. The Guarantor hereby
agrees  that  its  obligations   hereunder  shall  be  full  and  unconditional,
irrespective of the validity,  legality or  enforceability  of the Securities of
the First  Series or the  Indenture,  the  absence of any action to enforce  the
same,  the waiver or consent by the Holder of the Securities of the First Series
or by the Trustee with respect to any provisions  thereof or of said  Indenture,
the  recovery of any  judgment  against the Company or any action to enforce the
same or any other  circumstance  which  might  otherwise  constitute  a legal or
equitable  discharge  or defense of a guarantor.  The  Guarantor  hereby  waives
diligence,  presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the
event of merger or bankruptcy of the Company,  any right to require a proceeding
first against the Company,  protest or notice with respect to the  Securities of
the  First  Series  or the  indebtedness  evidenced  thereby,  and  all  demands
whatsoever,  and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged  except by
complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities of the First
Series and in this Guarantee.

                  The Guarantor  hereby  guarantees  that the obligations of the
Company under the Securities of the First Series and the Indenture to the extent
related  to  such  series  will  be  paid  to the  Trustee  without  set-off  or
counterclaim or other reduction  whatsoever  (whether for taxes,  withholding or
otherwise) in lawful currency of the United States of America.

                  The obligations of the Guarantor  hereunder are independent of
the  obligations of the Company under the Securities of the First Series and the
Indenture to the extent related to such series, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted  against the Guarantor whether or not an action or
proceeding  is brought  against  the  Company  and whether or not the Company is
joined  in any  such  action  or  proceeding.  The  liability  of the  Guarantor
hereunder  is full and  unconditional  and (to the extent  permitted by law) the
liability  and  obligations  of the Guarantor  hereunder  shall not be released,
discharged,  mitigated,  waived, impaired or affected in whole or in part by any
circumstance  (including any statute of  limitations)  (other than payment) that
might  constitute  a defense  available  to, or  discharge of the Company or the
Guarantor,   including,   without   limitation,   any  termination,   amendment,
modification, addition, deletion, supplement or other change to any of the terms
of the Securities of the First Series or the Indenture,  any failure on the part
of the Trustee or any Holder to enforce,  assert or exercise any right, power or
remedy,  any  waiver,  consent,  extension,  renewal,  indulgence,   compromise,
release,  settlement,  refunding or other action or inaction under or in respect
of any obligation or liability of the Company or the Guarantor or the Trustee or
any  Holder,  or any  modification,  compromise,


<PAGE>

settlement or release by the Trustee,  or by operation of law or  otherwise,  of
the  obligations  or the  liability of the Company  under the  Securities of the
First Series, in whole or in part.

                  The  Guarantor  agrees  that if at any time all or any part of
any payment at any time received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities
of the First  Series is or must be  rescinded or returned by the Trustee or such
Holders  for  any  reason  whatsoever   (including,   without  limitation,   the
insolvency,  reorganization or bankruptcy of the Company),  then the Guarantor's
obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned,
be deemed to have continued in existence  notwithstanding  such previous receipt
by the Trustee or such Holders, and the Guarantor's  obligations hereunder shall
continue to be effective or  reinstated,  as the case may be, as if such payment
had never been made.

                  The  failure of the  Trustee  to  enforce  any right or remedy
hereunder,  or promptly to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to
enforce any such right or remedy,  shall not  constitute a waiver  thereof,  nor
give rise to any estoppel against the Trustee, nor excuse the Guarantor from its
obligations hereunder.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Guarantee  or of the  Indenture  shall  alter or  impair  the  guarantee  of the
Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional,  of the due and punctual payment
of the  principal  of and  premium,  if any, and interest on the Security of the
series upon which this Guarantee is endorsed.

                  The Guarantor  shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder
of the  Securities  of the First  Series  against  the Company in respect of any

conveyance,  transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for,
and may exercise  every right and power of, the Guarantor  under this  Guarantee
and under the terms of the Securities of the First Series (including  assumption
of the  obligations  under  the  Securities  of the First  Series  and under the
Indenture to the extent  related to such series) with the same effect as if such
successor Person had been named as the Guarantor herein, and thereafter,  except
in the  case of a  lease,  the  predecessor  Person  shall  be  relieved  of all
obligations and covenants under this Guarantee.

               redemption   to  be  rescinded   upon  the   rescission  of  such
               acceleration);  it being  expressly  understood that such Secured
               Obligations  (x) may, but need not, bear  interest,  (y) may, but
               need not,  contain  provisions for the redemption  thereof at the

               redemption  price or prices  not less than the  principal  amount
               thereof  and (z) shall be held by the  Trustee for the benefit of
               the Holders of all  Securities  of the First  Series from time to

               secured by such Lien,  to the effect that all  Securities  of the
               First Series then Outstanding are entitled to the benefit of such
               Lien equally and ratably with all other indebtedness  outstanding
               under such Lien or (b) if Secured Obligations are to be delivered
               to the Trustee,  to the effect that such Secured Obligations have
               been  duly   issued   under  such  Lien  and   constitute   valid
               obligations,  entitled  to the  benefit of such Lien  equally and
               ratably with all other  indebtedness  then outstanding under such

                  event that any Interest  Payment  Date is not a Business  Day,
                  then payment of interest  payable on such date will be made on
                  the next  succeeding  day which is a Business Day (and without
                  any interest or other payment in respect of such delay),  with
                  the same force and effect as if made on such Interest  Payment
                  Date;

         5.       Each installment of interest on a Security of the First Series
                  registered  in the  name  of  Cede  & Co.  (or  any  successor
                  thereof)  at the close of business  on the  Business  Day next
                  preceding  the relevant  Interest  Payment Date (the  "Regular
                  Record Date") for the  Securities of the First Series shall be
                  payable to such  Holder;  each  installment  of  interest on a
                  Security  of the  First  Series  not so  registered  shall  be
                  payable  to  the  Person  in  whose  name  such   Security  is
                  registered  at the close of business on the date 

<PAGE>
                  fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant  Interest Payment Date
                  (the "Alternate Record Date") or if such date is not a
                  Business Day, the next  succeeding  Business Day. The Company
                  shall not be required to execute or to provide for the 
                  registration  of transfer  of or the exchange of any Security
                  of the First Series during a period of 15 days next preceding
                  any Interest Payment Date for such Series. Any installment of
                  interest on the Securities of the First Series not punctually
                  paid or duly provided  for  shall  forthwith  cease  to be
                  payable to the Holders of such Securities of the First Series
                  on such Regular Record Date or Alternate  Record Date, as the
                  case may be, and may be paid to the Persons in whose name the
                  Securities of the First  Series are  registered  at the close
                  of  business  on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the
                  Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest. Notice of
                  such Defaulted Interest and  Special  Record Date shall be
                  given to the Holders of the Securities  of the First Series
                  not less than 10 days prior to such Special  Record  Date, or
                  may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not
                  inconsistent  with the requirements of any  securities 
                  exchange on which the Securities of the First Series may be
                  listed,  and upon such notice as may be required by such
                  exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture;

         6.       The  principal,  premium,  if any,  and  each  installment  of
                  interest  on the  Securities  of the  First  Series  shall  be
                  payable in immediately available funds at the office or agency
                  of the Company in The City of New York;  provided that payment
                  of interest  may be made at the option of the Company by check
                  mailed to the address of the persons  entitled thereto or wire
                  transfer.  Registration  and  registration  of  transfers  and
                  exchanges in respect of the Securities of the First Series may
                  be effected at the office or agency of the Company in The City
                  of New  York.  Notices,  demands  to or upon  the  Company  in
                  respect of the Securities of the First Series may be served at
                  the  office or agency of the  Company in The City of New York.
                  The Trustee  will  initially  be the agency of the Company for
                  such service of notices and demands;  provided,  however, that
                  the  Company  reserves  the  right to  change,  by one or more
                  Officer's  Certificates any such office or agency. The Trustee
                  will initially be the Security  Registrar and the Paying Agent
                  for the Securities of the First Series;

         7.       The  Securities  of the First  Series  will be  redeemable  as
                  provided  in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto,  upon not
                  less  than 30 nor  more  than 60  days'  notice  given  to the
                  Holders thereof.  In case of any redemption at the election of
                  the Company of all of the Securities of the First Series,  the
                  Company shall,  at least 45 days prior to the Redemption  Date
                  fixed  by the  Company  (unless  a  shorter  notice  shall  be
                  satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of
                  such  Redemption  Date.  In  case  of  any  redemption  at the
                  election  of the  Company of less than all the  Securities  of
                  such series,  the Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the
                  Redemption  Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice
                  shall be satisfactory  to the Trustee),  notify the Trustee in
                  writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of
                  Securities  of such series to be  redeemed  and deliver to the
                  Trustee an  Officer's  Certificate  stating that no default in
                  payment of  interest or Event of Default  with  respect to the
                  Securities  of such series has occurred  (or, if such an Event
                  of Default shall have  occurred,  that the same has been cured
                  or waived);

         8.       The  Securities  of the First Series will be initially  issued
                  pursuant  to Rule 144A under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as
                  amended,  to Cede & Co. (as nominee for The

                  successor  thereof) for such purpose shall bear the depository
                  legend  in  substantially  the form set  forth  in  Exhibit  A
                  hereto, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, such agreement
                  to be confirmed in writing to the  Trustee.  Each  Security of
                  the First  Series  shall bear the  non-registration  legend in
                  substantially  the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto,  unless
                  otherwise  agreed  by  the  Company,   such  agreement  to  be
                  confirmed in writing to the Trustee. Nothing in the Indenture,
                  the Securities of the First Series or this  certificate  shall
                  be construed to require the Company to register any Securities
                  of the First  Series  under  the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as
                  amended,  unless  otherwise  expressly  agreed by the Company,
                  confirmed in writing to the  Trustee,  or to make any transfer
                  of  such   Securities  in  violation  of  applicable  law.  In
                  connection  with  any  transfer  of  Securities  of the  First
                  Series,  the Trustee,  the Security  Registrar and the Company
                  shall be  under  no duty to  inquire  into,  may  conclusively
                  presume the  correctness  of, and shall be fully  protected in
                  relying upon the  certificates  and other  information (in the
                  attached forms or otherwise) received from the Holders and any
                  transferees  of any  Securities of the First Series  regarding
                  the  validity,  legality  and due  authorization  of any  such
                  transfer,  the  eligibility  of the transferee to receive such
                  Security and any other facts and circumstances related to such
                  transfer;

         9.       No  service  charge  shall  be made  for the  registration  of
                  transfer or exchange of the  Securities  of the First  Series;
                  provided,  however,  that the Company may require payment of a
                  sum sufficient to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge
                  that  may be  imposed  in  connection  with  the  exchange  or
                  transfer;

         10.      The  Company  additionally  covenants  that,  so  long  as any
                  Securities of the First Series remain Outstanding, it will:

                  A.       keep proper books of record and account in accordance
                           with generally accepted accounting principles;

                  B.       pay   all   applicable    taxes,    assessments   and
                           governmental  charges  imposed  upon it or any of its
                           properties  or  assets  or in  respect  of any of its
                           franchises,  business  income or  profits  and comply
                           with all applicable statutes,  regulations and orders
                           of  governmental  bodies relating to taxes except for
                           any  tax  the   payment   of  which,   or   statutes,

                           each case,  is being  contested  in good faith and by
                           appropriate  means  and for which  adequate  reserves
                           have been  provided  or with  respect to which  there
                           would not  reasonably  be  expected  to be a material
                           adverse  effect  on the  financial  condition  of the
                           Company;

                  C.       carry and  maintain  in full  force and effect at all
                           times  with  fiscally  sound and  reputable  insurers

                           reasonable and prudent in the circumstances; provided
                           that such insurance  shall be comparable to insurance
                           carried by, or otherwise  maintained  by,

                           Company carrying on the same types of businesses;

                  D.       comply with the  requirements of all applicable laws,
                           rules,  regulations  and  orders of any  governmental
                           authority,   the   noncompliance   with  which  would
                           materially  adversely affect the business,  condition
                           (financial   or   other),   assets,   properties   or
                           operations of the Company taken as a whole;

         11.      So  long  as  any   Securities  of  the  First  Series  remain
                  Outstanding,  the following shall constitute additional Events
                  of Default with respect to such series:

                  (a)      At any  time  prior  to the  payment  in  full of all
                           amounts due under the Securities of the First Series,
                           the Company shall fail to pay aggregate  Indebtedness
                           (as hereinafter  defined) in excess of the greater of
                           (i) $15  million  and (ii) 5% of the total  assets of
                           the  Company  (whether as to  principal,  interest or
                           premium)  when due, and such failure  shall  continue
                           after  applicable  grace  periods  specified  in  the
                           agreement    or    instrument    relating   to   such
                           Indebtedness,  if the  effect of such  failure  is to
                           accelerate the maturity of such Indebtedness, and, in
                           such case,  the Company shall have failed to cure (or
                           obtain a waiver of) such  failure  or default  within
                           ten days after the  expiration  of such grace  period
                           has occurred;

                  (b)      At any  time  prior  to the  payment  in  full of all
                           amounts due under the Securities of the First Series,
                           the   Guarantor   shall   fail   to   pay   aggregate
                           Indebtedness in excess of $25 million  (whether as to
                           principal,  interest or premium)  when due,  and such
                           failure shall continue after applicable grace periods
                           specified in the agreement or instrument  relating to
                           such  Indebtedness,  if the effect of such failure is
                           to accelerate the maturity of such Indebtedness, and,
                           in such case, the Guarantor shall have failed to cure
                           (or obtain a waiver of) such  failure or default with
                           ten days after the  expiration  of such grace  period
                           has occurred;

                           Indebtedness,  as  used in  this  certificate,  shall
                           mean,  with  respect to a Person  (as  defined in the
                           Indenture),  all obligations (other than non-recourse
                           obligations)  of, or  guaranteed  or assumed by, such

                  (c) or (d) of this  section  (each such  event,  a  "Guarantor
                  Event"),  such  Guarantor  Event  shall not be deemed to be an

                  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  in  accordance  with
                  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as in effect from
                  time to time,  or  evidenced  by bonds,  debentures,  notes or
                  other  similar  instruments,  and in  each  case,  amendments,
                  renewals, extensions, modifications and refundings of any such
                  indebtedness or obligations,  whether  existing as of the date
                  of this Indenture or subsequently incurred by the Company;

         13.      The obligation of the Company to make due and punctual payment
                  of the  principal of and premium,  if any, and interest on the
                  Securities   of  the   First   Series   shall  be  fully   and
                  unconditionally  guaranteed by the  Guarantor,  as provided in
                  the Guarantee to be delivered by the Guarantor to the Trustee.
                  The form of such  Guarantee  is attached  hereto as Exhibit B.
                  The Trustee shall hold and enforce such  Guarantee  solely for
                  the  benefit  of the  Holders of the  Securities  of the First
                  Series. If any amounts shall become due and payable under such
                  Guarantee,  the  Trustee,  in its own name and as trustee  for
                  such  Holders,  may demand  payment,  may institute a judicial
                  proceeding  for the  collection of the sums so due and unpaid,
                  may prosecute such  proceeding to judgment or final decree and
                  may  enforce  the same and  collect  the  moneys  adjudged  or
                  decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law;

         14.      The  obligations  of the Company  under the  Securities of the
                  First Series and under the Indenture to the extent  related to
                  such  series  will be  subject to  assumption  in whole by the
                  Guarantor  at any time (and upon such  assumption  the Company
                  shall be released and discharged  from its  obligations  under
                  the  Securities of the First Series and under the Indenture to
                  the extent related to such series) as provided in the form set
                  forth  in  Exhibit  A  hereto.   Upon  such  assumption,   the
                  additional Events of Default contained in clauses (a), (c) and
                  (d) and the last  paragraph of Section 11 of this  certificate
                  shall  be  deleted  and  the  following  modifications  to the
                  Indenture shall be made by supplemental  indenture,  to remain
                  in effect so long as any Securities of the First Series remain
                  Outstanding:

                  A.       The provisions  contained in the Guarantee  under the
                           heading  "Limitation  of Liens" shall be added to the
                           Indenture.   In  making  such   addition,   the  word
                           "Company"   shall   be   substituted   for  the  word
                           "Guarantor",    the   word   "Indenture"   shall   be
                           substituted  for the word  "Guarantee" and such other
                           modifications  as the context  may  require  shall be
                           made.

                  B.       The additional Event of Default contained in clause 
                           (b) of Section 11 of this certificate shall be added
                           to the Indenture.  In making such addition, the word
                           "Company"  shall  be  substituted  for  the  word
                           "Guarantor".

         15.      The Securities of the First Series shall have such other terms
                  and  provisions as are provided in the form of the  Securities
                  of the First  Series set forth in Exhibit A hereto,  and shall
                  be issued in substantially such form;

                      7.70% SENIOR NOTE, SERIES A, DUE 2006

                  ADESA  Corporation,  a corporation duly organized and existing
under the laws of the State of Indiana  (herein  referred  to as the  "Company",
which  term  includes  any  successor  Person  under the  Indenture),  for value
received,          hereby          promises          to          pay          to
____________________________________________________________________________, or
registered assigns, the principal sum of ____________________ Dollars on June 1,
2006 (the "Stated  Maturity" of the  Securities of this  series),  and to pay
interest on said principal  sum, from and  including,  May 30, 1996 or from, and
including, the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid
or duly  provided  for,  semi-annually  on June 1 and  December  1 of each year,
commencing  December 1, 1996 at the rate of 7.70% per annum until the  principal
hereof is paid or made available for payment.  The amount of interest payable on
any  Interest  Payment  Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve  30-day  months.  Interest on the  Securities  of this series will accrue
from,  and  including,  May 30, 1996 to the first  Interest  Payment  Date,  and
thereafter will accrue,  from, and including,  the last Interest Payment Date to
which  interest  has been  paid or duly  provided  for.  In the  event  that any
Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on
such date will be made on the next  succeeding  day which is a Business Day (and
without any interest or other  payment in respect of such delay),  with the same
force and effect as if made on the Interest  Payment  Date.  If this Security is
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (or any successor  thereto) at the close of
business on the Business Day next preceding the relevant  Interest Payment Date,
the  interest so  payable,  and  punctually  paid or duly  provided  for, on any
Interest  Payment  Date will,  as  provided in such  Indenture,  be paid to such
Holder;  if this  security is not so  registered,  the interest so payable,  and
punctually  paid or duly  provided  for, on any Interest  Payment Date will,  as
provided in the  Indenture be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or
one or more  Predecessor  Securities)  is registered at the close of business on
the date fifteen (15) days next preceding such Interest  Payment Date or if such
date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding  Business Day. The Company shall
not be required to execute or to provide for the  registration of transfer of or
the exchange of any Security of the First Series during a period of fifteen (15)
days next preceding any Interest Payment Date for such Series. Any such interest
not so punctually  paid or duly provided for will forthwith  cease to be payable
to the Holder on such  Regular  Record  Date or

Security (or one or more  Predecessor  Securities) is registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted  Interest to
be fixed by the Trustee,  notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities
of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special  Record  Date,  or be
paid  at any  time  in  any  other  lawful  manner  not  inconsistent  with  the
requirements  of any securities  exchange on which the Securities of this series
may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange,  all as
more fully provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.

                  Payment of the principal of and premium,  if any, and interest
on this Security will be made in  immediately  available  funds at the office or
agency of the Company  maintained  for that purpose in The City of New York, the
State of New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at
the time of payment is legal  tender for  payment of public and  private  debts,
provided, however, that, at the option of the Company, interest on this Security
may be paid by check mailed to the address of the person  entitled  thereto,  as
such address shall appear on the Security Register or by wire transfer.

                  Reference  is hereby  made to the further  provisions  of this
Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all
purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

                  Unless  the  certificate  of  authentication  hereon  has been
executed by the Trustee  referred to on the reverse hereof by manual  signature,
this  Security  shall not be entitled to any benefit  under the  Indenture or be
valid or obligatory for any purpose.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the Company has caused this instrument to
be duly executed.

                          [FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY]


                  This Security is one of a duly authorized  issue of securities
of the Company (herein called the "Securities"),  issued and to be issued in one
or more series under an Indenture,  dated as of May 15, 1996  (herein,  together
with any amendments thereto,  called the "Indenture",  which term shall have the
meaning assigned to it in such instrument),  between the Company and The Bank of
New York,  as Trustee  (herein  called the  "Trustee",  which term  includes any
successor  trustee  under the  Indenture),  and  reference is hereby made to the
Indenture,  including the Board Resolutions and Officer's Certificate filed with
the Trustee on May 30, 1996  creating the series  designated on the face hereof,
for a statement of the  respective  rights,  limitations  of rights,  duties and
immunities  thereunder  of the  Company,  the  Trustee  and the  Holders  of the
Securities  and of the terms  upon  which  the  Securities  are,  and are to be,
authenticated  and delivered.  This Security is one of the series  designated on
the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $90,000,000.

         The  Securities of this series are subject to redemption  upon not less
than 30 days nor more  than 60  days'  notice  by  mail,  at the  option  of the
Company,  in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time (but, if in part,
only in connection with redemptions of Securities of this series in an aggregate
principal  amount  of  $1,000  or any  integral  multiple  thereof),  at a price
("Redemption  Price")  equal  to the  sum of (A)  the  principal  amount  of the
Securities  of this series to be  redeemed,  plus (B) accrued  interest  thereon
(except if the  Redemption  Date shall be an Interest  Payment Date) to the date
selected for  redemption  ("Redemption  Date"),  plus (C) a premium equal to the
Make-Whole  Amount (as  hereinafter  defined).  Each Security of this series (or
portion thereof) so redeemed shall be canceled (or such portion thereof shall be
deemed to have been canceled) and, thereafter, shall not be reissued.

         Notice of a make-whole  redemption shall be accompanied by an Officer's
Certificate  certifying:  (A) the preliminary redemption price (the "Preliminary
Redemption Price"),  including the aggregate applicable principal,  interest and
Make-Whole  Amount,  and (B) the portion of such  Preliminary  Redemption  Price
allocable to each Security of this series.  On or prior to the Redemption  Date,
the Company shall deliver to each Holder of the Securities of this series and to
the Trustee a further Officer's Certificate certifying (X) the Redemption Price,
including the aggregate  applicable  principal,  interest and Make-Whole Amount,
and (Y) the portion of such Redemption  Price allocable to each Security of this
series.

         Any Holder of the  Securities  of this  series  shall have the right to
contest  the  calculation  of any  Redemption  Price  to be paid or paid to such
Holder as the result of any make-whole  redemption by delivering  written notice
to the Company,  within five (5) Business  Days of receipt by such Holder of the
further Officer's  Certificate referred to in the preceding  paragraph,  setting
forth such Holder's  objection.  Within five (5) Business Days of receipt by the
Company  of any such  notice,  the  Company  shall  notify  each  Holder of such
Securities of this series and the Trustee of the nature of such objection and of
the Company's  response thereto.  Any increase in a Redemption Price made by the
Company  as a result  of any such  objection  shall be paid to each  Holder  and
acceptance  thereof  shall not be  deemed  to be a waiver by such  Holder of any
right to  contest  the amount of such  payment;  provided,  that  notice of such
contest has been  delivered to the Company  within five (5) Business  Days after
receipt of such further Officer's Certificate.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

         The Trustee  shall be under no duty to inquire into,  may  conclusively
presume  the  correctness  of, and shall be fully  protected  in acting upon the
Company's calculation of any Preliminary  Redemption Price, any Redemption Price
and any increase therein.

         The term "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday
or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or
required  by law or  executive  order to  remain  closed  or a day on which  the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee is closed for business.

         The term "Discount Rate" means the Treasury Rate plus .20%.

         The term  "Make-Whole  Amount" means an amount equal to the excess,  if
any, of (A) the sum of the present values, on the day after the Redemption Date,
of the amount of each  remaining  scheduled  payment of interest  (exclusive  of
interest  accrued to the Redemption  Date) on and principal of the Securities of
this series,  or portion of such payment,  which will not be required to be made
as a result of such optional redemption (each such amount discounted  separately
at the Discount  Rate,  to be  determined  (1) with  respect to the  Preliminary
Redemption  Price,  as of the third  Business  Day before the date of mailing of
notice of an optional redemption,  and (2) with respect to the Redemption Price,
as  of  the  third   Business  Day  before  the  Redemption   Date,   compounded
semi-annually,  from the date such  amount  would have been  due),  over (B) the
principal amount of such Securities of this series to be optionally redeemed.

         The  term  "Treasury  Rate"  means  the  rate  per  annum  equal to the
arithmetic  average of (A) the average yields on issues of  non-callable  United
States Treasury  securities adjusted to a constant maturity equal to the Life to
Maturity  of the  Securities  of  this  series  (determined,  if  necessary,  by
interpolating  such yields on  non-callable  United States  Treasury  securities
adjusted to the particular constant maturities greater than (but nearest to) and
less  than (but  nearest  to) the Life to  Maturity  of the  Securities  of this
series),  as  published  by the Federal  Reserve  Board for release on the first
Business Day  preceding  the Business Day on which such  determination  shall be
made in its Statistical  Release H.15(519) under the heading "Treasury  Constant
Maturities," for the two calendar weeks ending on the two Wednesdays immediately
preceding the date of such release, or (B) if such average yields shall not have
been published for such periods,  two such reasonably  comparable indices as may
be designated  for such period by the Company and not objected to by the Holders
of a majority in aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount of the  Securities of this
series then Outstanding.

         The term "Life to Maturity" of the Securities of this series means,  as
of the date of the determination thereof, the number of years (calculated to the
nearest one-twelfth) which will elapse between the date of determination and the
Stated Maturity of the Securities of this series.

                  In the event of  redemption  of this  Security in part only, a
new Security or Securities  of this series and of like tenor for the  unredeemed
portion  hereof  will be  issued  in the  name of the  Holder  hereof  upon  the
cancellation hereof.

                  The Indenture  contains  provisions for defeasance at any time
of the  entire  indebtedness  of this  Security  upon  compliance  with  certain
conditions set forth in the Indenture.

                  If an Event of  Default  with  respect to  Securities  of this
series shall occur and be  continuing,  the principal of the  Securities of this
series  may be  declared  due and  payable  in the  manner  and with the  effect
provided in the Indenture.

                  The  Indenture  permits,  with certain  exceptions  as therein
provided,  the  amendment  thereof  and  the  modification  of  the  rights  and
obligations  of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the  Securities  of
each series to be affected  under the  Indenture  at any time by the Company and
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the  Securities at the time  Outstanding of all series to be affected.
The  Indenture  also  contains  provisions  permitting  the Holders of specified
percentages  in aggregate  principal  amount of the Securities of each series at
the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series,
to waive compliance by the Company with certain  provisions of the Indenture and
certain past  defaults  under the  Indenture  and their  consequences.  Any such
consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding
upon  such  Holder  and upon all  future  Holders  of this  Security  and of any
Security issued upon the  registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor
or in lieu  hereof,  whether or not  notation of such  consent or waiver is made
upon this Security.

                  As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture,
the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder,  unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a continuing  Event of Default with respect to the
Securities of this series,  the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal  amount of the  Securities of such series at the time  Outstanding  in
respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall
have made written request to the Trustee to institute  proceedings in respect of
such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee  reasonable  indemnity,
and the  Trustee  shall not have  received  from the  Holders of a  majority  in
aggregate  principal  amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding
in respect of which an Event of Default  shall have occurred and be continuing a
direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any
such proceeding,  for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of
indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of
this  Security for the  enforcement  of any payment of  principal  hereof or any
premium  or  interest  hereon on or after  the  respective  due dates  expressed
herein.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Security  or of the  Indenture  shall  alter or  impair  the  obligation  of the
Company,  which is absolute and  unconditional,  to pay the principal of and any
premium and interest on this Security at the times,  place and rate,  and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

                  The  Securities of this series are issuable only in registered
form  without  coupons  in  denominations  of $1,000 and any  integral  multiple
thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth,  Securities  of this  series are  exchangeable  for a like  aggregate
principal  amount  of  Securities  of  this  series  and of  like  tenor  and of
authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

                  No service charge shall be made for any such  registration  of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

and  neither  the  Company,  the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

                  The Securities of this series are entitled to the benefit of a
Guarantee of Minnesota  Power & Light Company  (together with its successors and
assigns,  the "Guarantor")  dated as of May 30, 1996 delivered to the Trustee as

the  obligations  of the  Company  under the  Securities  of this series and the
Indenture  to the extent  related to such  series are  assumed by  Guarantor  as

                  Unless an Event of Default, or an event which, after notice or
lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and
be  continuing,  the  obligations  of the Company  under the  Securities of this
series and the Indenture to the extent  related to such series may be assumed in
whole, on a full recourse basis, by the Guarantor at any time (and upon any such
assumption  the Company shall be released and  discharged  from its  obligations
under the  Securities of this series and the Indenture to the extent  related to
such series);  provided,  however, that such assumption shall be subject to, and

                       INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED INVESTORS]


ADESA Corporation
The Bank of New York, as Trustee


Dear Sirs:

         In connection with our proposed purchase of $_______________  aggregate
principal amount of 7.70% Senior Notes,  Series A, Due 2006 (the "Senior Notes")
of ADESA Corporation, an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), we confirm that:

                  1.  We  understand   that  the  Senior  Notes  have  not  been
         registered   under  the   Securities  Act  of  1933,  as  amended  (the
         "Securities  Act"),  and may not be sold  except  as  permitted  in the
         following  sentence.  We agree,  on our own behalf and on behalf of any
         accounts  for which we are  acting as  hereinafter  stated,  that if we
         should  resell,  pledge or otherwise  transfer such Senior Notes within
         three  years  after the later of the  original  issuance  of the Senior
         Notes or the sale thereof by the Company or an "affiliate"  (within the
         meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company  (computed
         in accordance  with Rule 144 under the Securities  Act) or if we are at
         the  proposed  date of such  transfer or were  during the three  months
         preceding  the  proposed  date of transfer an affiliate of the Company,
         such Senior Notes may be resold, pledged or transferred only (i) to the
         Company,  (ii) so long as such  Senior  Notes are  eligible  for resale
         pursuant  to Rule 144A under the  Securities  Act ("Rule  144A"),  to a
         person whom we reasonably believe is a "qualified  institutional buyer"
         (as defined in Rule 144A) ("QIB") that purchases for its own account or
         for the  account of a QIB,  to whom  notice is given  that the  resale,
         pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A (as indicated
         by the box checked by the transferor on the  Certificate of Transfer on
         the  reverse  of the  certificate  for the Senior  Notes),  (iii) in an
         offshore  transaction in accordance with Rule 904 of Regulation S under
         the  Securities  Act (as indicated by the box checked by the transferor
         on the  Certificate of Transfer on the reverse of the  certificate  for
         the Senior  Notes),  or (iv) to an  institution  that is an "accredited
         investor"  as  defined  in Rule  501(a)(1),  (2),  (3) or (7) under the
         Securities  Act (as  indicated by the box checked by the  transferor on

         Senior  Notes)  that is  acquiring  the  Senior  Notes  for  investment
         purposes and not for  distribution and a Certificate in the form hereof
         is  delivered  to the Company and to the  Trustee  under the  Indenture
         relating to the Senior Notes by such Accredited Investor,  in each case
         in accordance  with any applicable  securities laws of any state of the
         United  States,  and we will notify any  purchaser  of the Senior Notes
         from  us of the  above  resale  restrictions,  if then  applicable.  We
         further  understand  that in connection with any transfer of the Senior
         Notes by us that the Company and the  Trustee  may  request,  and if so
         requested we will furnish,  such  certificates and other information as
         they may reasonably  require to confirm that any such transfer complies
         with the foregoing restrictions.

                  2. We are an  institutional  investor  and are an  "accredited
         investor" (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1),  (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation
         D under the  Securities  Act) and we have such knowledge and experience

                  3. We are acquiring  the Senior Notes  purchased by us for our
         own  account  or  for  one  or  more  accounts  (each  of  which  is an
         institutional  "accredited  investor")  as to each of which we exercise
         sole  investment  discretion,  for  investment  purposes  and  not  for
         distribution.

the  Trustee  under  the  Indenture,  dated as of May 15,  1996,  between  ADESA
Corporation (the "Company") and The Bank of New York, as Trustee  (together with
any amendments thereto, the "Indenture"),  the payment of the obligations of the
Company under the  Securities of the First Series and the Indenture  relating to
such series, including,  without limitation, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of and premium,  if any, and interest on the  Securities  of the First
Series when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity or
upon redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, according to the terms thereof
and of the  Indenture.  In case of the failure of the Company  punctually to pay
any such principal, premium, if any, or interest, the Guarantor hereby agrees to
cause any such payment to be made  punctually  when and as the same shall become
due and payable,  whether at maturity or upon redemption or upon  declaration or
otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company. The Guarantor hereby
agrees  that  its  obligations   hereunder  shall  be  full  and  unconditional,
irrespective of the validity,  legality or  enforceability  of the Securities of
the First  Series or the  Indenture,  the  absence of any action to enforce  the
same,  the waiver or consent by the Holder of the Securities of the First Series
or by the Trustee with respect to any provisions  thereof or of said  Indenture,
the  recovery of any  judgment  against the Company or any action to enforce the
same or any other  circumstance  which  might  otherwise  constitute  a legal or
equitable  discharge  or defense of a guarantor.  The  Guarantor  hereby  waives
diligence,  presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the
event of merger or bankruptcy of the Company,  any right to require a proceeding
first against the Company,  protest or notice with respect to the  Securities of
the  First  Series  or the  indebtedness  evidenced  thereby,  and  all  demands
whatsoever,  and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged  except by
complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities of the First
Series and in this Guarantee.

                  The Guarantor  hereby  guarantees  that the obligations of the
Company under the Securities of the First Series and the Indenture to the extent
related  to  such  series  will  be  paid  to the  Trustee  without  set-off  or
counterclaim or other reduction  whatsoever  (whether for taxes,  withholding or
otherwise) in lawful currency of the United States of America.

                  The obligations of the Guarantor  hereunder are independent of
the  obligations of the Company under the Securities of the First Series and the
Indenture to the extent related to such series, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted  against the Guarantor whether or not an action or
proceeding  is brought  against  the  Company  and whether or not the Company is
joined  in any  such  action  or  proceeding.  The  liability  of the  Guarantor
hereunder  is full and  unconditional  and (to the extent  permitted by law) the
liability  and  obligations  of the Guarantor  hereunder  shall not be released,
discharged,  mitigated,  waived, impaired or affected in whole or in part by any
circumstance  (including any statute of  limitations)  (other than payment) that
might  constitute  a defense  available  to, or  discharge of the Company or the
Guarantor,   including,   without   limitation,   any  termination,

amendment,  modification,  addition, deletion, supplement or other change to any
of the terms of the Securities of the First Series or the Indenture, any failure
on the part of the  Trustee or any Holder to  enforce,  assert or  exercise  any
right, power or remedy, any waiver,  consent,  extension,  renewal,  indulgence,
compromise, release, settlement,  refunding or other action or inaction under or
in respect of any obligation or liability of the Company or the Guarantor or the
Trustee or any Holder, or any modification, compromise, settlement or release by
the Trustee,  or by operation of law or  otherwise,  of the  obligations  or the
liability of the Company under the  Securities of the First Series,  in whole or
in part.

                  The  Guarantor  agrees  that if at any time all or any part of
any payment at any time received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities
of the First  Series is or must be  rescinded or returned by the Trustee or such
Holders  for  any  reason  whatsoever   (including,   without  limitation,   the
insolvency,  reorganization or bankruptcy of the Company),  then the Guarantor's
obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned,
be deemed to have continued in existence  notwithstanding  such previous receipt
by the Trustee or such Holders, and the Guarantor's  obligations hereunder shall
continue to be effective or  reinstated,  as the case may be, as if such payment
had never been made.

                  The  failure of the  Trustee  to  enforce  any right or remedy
hereunder,  or promptly to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to
enforce any such right or remedy,  shall not  constitute a waiver  thereof,  nor
give rise to any estoppel against the Trustee, nor excuse the Guarantor from its
obligations hereunder.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Guarantee  or of the  Indenture  shall  alter or  impair  the  guarantee  of the
Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional,  of the due and punctual payment
of the  principal  of and  premium,  if any, and interest on the Security of the
series upon which this Guarantee is endorsed.

                  The Guarantor  shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder
of the  Securities  of the First  Series  against  the Company in respect of any
amounts paid by the Guarantor  pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee upon
payment by the Guarantor of all amounts due and payable under such Guarantee.

                  This  Guarantee  shall be  irrevocable  unless  terminated  as
provided  herein.  This Guarantee shall be terminated upon the assumption by the
Guarantor of the  obligations  of the Company under the  Securities of the First
Series and the Indenture to the extent related to such series as provided in the
terms of such Securities.

                  All  capitalized  terms used in this  Guarantee  which are not
defined  herein but are defined in the  Indenture  shall have the  meanings  set
forth in the Indenture.

                  This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made under the
laws of the State of New York and  shall for all  purposes  be  governed  by and
construed in accordance with the laws of such State.

      existing  under the laws of the United  States,  any State  thereof or the
      District of Columbia,  and shall expressly assume,  the obligations of the
      Guarantor under this Guarantee;

               (b) immediately  after giving effect to such transaction no Event
      of Default,  and no event  which,  after  notice or lapse of time or both,
      would become an Event of Default,  shall have occurred and be  continuing;
      and

               (c) the  Guarantor  shall  have  delivered  to  the  Trustee  an

      conveyance,  or other  transfer or lease and such  supplemental  indenture
      comply  with  this  Guarantee  and that all  conditions  precedent  herein
      provided for relating to such transactions have been complied with.

               Upon any  consolidation  by the  Guarantor  with or merger by the
Guarantor  into any other  corporation or any  conveyance,  or other transfer or
lease of the properties and assets of the Company  substantially  as an entirety
in  accordance  with this  Section,  the  successor  corporation  formed by such
consolidation  or into which the Guarantor is merged or the Person to which such
conveyance,  transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for,
and may exercise  every right and power of, the Guarantor  under this  Guarantee
and under the terms of the Securities of the First Series (including  assumption
of the  obligations  under  the  Securities  of the First  Series  and under the
Indenture to the extent  related to such series) with the same effect as if such
successor Person had been named as the Guarantor herein, and thereafter,  except
in the  case of a  lease,  the  predecessor  Person  shall  be  relieved  of all
obligations and covenants under this Guarantee.

Section 2. Limitation on Liens.

               A.      The Guarantor shall not suffer any Lien (other than 
Permitted Liens)  to be  created  or to  exist  upon any  property  (other  than
Excepted Property) of the Guarantor,  real, personal or mixed, of whatever kind 
or nature and  located  in the  State  of  Minnesota,  whether  owned  at the  
date of the execution and delivery of this  Guarantee or hereafter  acquired,  
all except as expressly contemplated in subsection B of this Section.

               B.      The provisions of subsection A shall not prohibit the 
creation or existence of any Lien on property of the Guarantor which secures 
indebtedness for borrowed money if either:

               this  Guarantee  shall be secured  equally and  ratably  with the

               First  Series then to mature and (c)  containing,  in addition to
               any  mandatory  redemption  provisions  applicable to all Secured

               provisions,  if any, for the mandatory  redemption (pursuant to a
               sinking fund or otherwise) of the  Securities of the First Series
               or for the  redemption  thereof at the option of the  Holder,  as
               well as a provision for mandatory redemption upon an acceleration
               of the maturity of all Outstanding Securities of the First Series
               following an Event of Default  (such  mandatory  redemption to be
               rescinded  upon the  rescission of such  acceleration);  it being
               expressly  understood that such Secured  Obligations (x) may, but
               need  not,  bear  interest,   (y)  may,  but  need  not,  contain
               provisions  for  the  redemption  thereof  at the  option  of the
               issuer,  any such redemption to be made at a redemption  price or
               prices not less than the principal  amount  thereof and (z) shall
               be held by the  Trustee  for the  benefit  of the  Holders of all
               Securities  of the First  Series  from  time to time  Outstanding
               subject to such terms and conditions relating to surrender to the
               Guarantor, transfer restrictions, voting, application of payments
               of principal and interest and other matters as shall be set forth
               in an indenture  supplemental hereto  specifically  providing for
               the delivery to the Trustee of such Secured Obligations.

               C.      If the Guarantor shall elect either of the alternatives 
described in subsection B, the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee:

                       1. an  amendment  to this  Guarantee  (a)  together  with

               stating the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness  issuable,
               and then proposed to be issued, under and secured by such Lien;

                       3. an Opinion of Counsel (a) if this  Guarantee  is to be
               secured by such Lien,  to the effect that all  Securities  of the
               First Series then Outstanding are entitled to the benefit of such
               Lien equally and ratably with all other indebtedness  outstanding
               under such Lien or (b) if Secured Obligations are to be delivered
               to the Trustee,  to the effect that such Secured Obligations have
               been  duly   issued   under  such  Lien  and   constitute   valid
               obligations,  entitled  to the  benefit of such Lien  equally and
               ratably with all other  indebtedness  then outstanding under such
               Lien.

such.

                       "Purchase Money Lien" means, with respect to any property

               in or the use of such property;

                       (c) is held by a trustee or agent for the  benefit of one

                       (d) otherwise constitutes a purchase money mortgage or a 
               purchase money security interest under applicable law;

and,  without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  for purposes of this
Guarantee,  the term  Purchase  Money Lien  shall be deemed to include  any Lien
described  above whether or not such Lien (x) shall permit the issuance or other
incurrence of additional indebtedness secured by such Lien on such property, (y)

         paragraphs  A.(h) or A.(o) of Exhibit  III is not true with  respect to
         any Pool  Receivable,  the Seller  shall be deemed to have  received on
         such day a Collection of such Pool Receivable in full;

                  (iii)  except as  provided  in  paragraph  (i) or (ii) of this
         Section  1.4(e),  or as  otherwise  required by  applicable  law or the
         relevant  Contract,  all  Collections  received  from an Obligor of any
         Receivable  shall be applied in accordance  with the Contract with such
         Obligor and the Credit and Collection Policy; and

                  (iv) if and to the extent the Agent or the Purchaser  shall be
         required  for any  reason to pay over to an  Obligor  (or any  trustee,
         receiver,  custodian or similar official in any Insolvency  Proceeding)
         any amount received by it hereunder, such amount shall be deemed not to
         have been so  received  but rather to have been  retained by the Seller
         and, accordingly, the Agent or the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall
         have a claim  against the Seller for such  amount,  payable when and to
         the extent that any  distribution  from or on behalf of such Obligor is
         made in respect thereof.

         (f) If at any time the Seller  shall wish to cause the  reduction  of a
Portion of  Investment  (but not to commence  the  liquidation,  or reduction to
zero, of the entire  Investment of the  Participation),  the Seller may do so as
follows:

                  (i) the  Seller  shall  give the Agent at least  two  Business
         Days'  prior  written  notice  thereof  (including  the  amount of such
         proposed  reduction and the proposed date on which such  reduction will
         commence),

                  (ii) on the proposed date of  commencement  of such  reduction
         and on each day thereafter,  the Servicer shall cause  Collections with
         respect to such Portion of Investment  not to be  reinvested  until the
         amount  thereof not so  reinvested  shall  equal the desired  amount of
         reduction, and

                  (iii)  the  Servicer  shall  hold  such   Collections  in  the
         Liquidation  Account for the benefit of the  Purchaser,  for payment to
         the Agent on the last day of the current  Settlement Period relating to
         such Portion of Investment,  and the  applicable  Portion of Investment
         shall be deemed reduced in the amount to be paid to the Agent only when
         in fact finally so paid;

                                      -7-

provided that,

                  A. unless otherwise agreed by the Agent the amount of any such
         reduction  shall be not less than  $1,000,000  and shall be an integral
         multiple  of  $100,000,  and  the  entire  Investment  (if  any) of the
         Participation  after giving effect to such reduction  shall be not less
         than $2,000,000,

                  B.  the  Seller  shall  use  reasonable  efforts  to  choose a
         reduction amount, and the date of commencement  thereof, so that to the
         extent  practicable  such reduction  shall commence and conclude in the
         same Yield Period, and

                  C. if two or more Portions of Investment  shall be outstanding
         at the time of any proposed reduction, such proposed reduction shall be
         applied,  unless the Seller shall otherwise specify in the notice given
         pursuant to Section  1.4(f)(i),  to the Portion of Investment  with the
         shortest remaining Yield Period.

         Section 1.5.  Fees.  The Seller shall pay to the Agent  certain fees in
the  amounts  and on the dates set forth in a letter  dated  December  31,  1996
between  the  Seller  and the Agent  (as the same may be  amended,  amended  and
restated,  supplemented  or modified,  the "Fee Letter")  delivered  pursuant to
Section 1 of Exhibit II, as such letter  agreement may be amended,  supplemented
or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof.

         Section 1.6. Payments and Computations, Etc. (a) All amounts to be paid
or deposited by the Seller or the Servicer  hereunder shall be paid or deposited
no later than noon  (Chicago  time) on the day when due in same day funds to the
Purchaser's  Account.  All amounts  received  after noon (Chicago  time) will be
deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day.

         (b) The Seller shall,  to the extent  permitted by law, pay interest on
any amount not paid or  deposited  by the Seller or Servicer to the  Purchaser's
Account when due  hereunder,  at an interest  rate equal to 2.0% per annum above
the Base Rate, payable on demand.

         (c) All  computations  of interest  under  subsection (b) above and all
computations of Discount, fees, and other amounts hereunder shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed.  Whenever any
payment  or  deposit  to be made  hereunder  shall be due on a day other  than a
Business  Day,  such  payment  or  deposit  shall be made no later than the next
succeeding  Business  Day and such  extension  of time shall be  included in the
computation of such payment or deposit.

         Section 1.7.  Dividing or Combining  Portions of the  Investment of the
Participation.  The Seller may, on the last day of any Yield Period,  either (i)
divide the Investment of the  Participation  into two or more portions  (each, a
"Portion  of  Investment")  equal,  in  aggregate,  to  the  Investment  of  the
Participation,  provided that after giving effect to such division the amount of
each such  Portion  of  Investment  shall be not less than  $1,000,000,  or (ii)
combine any two or more Portions of Investment  outstanding on such last day and
having Yield Periods ending on such last day into a single Portion of Investment
equal  to the  aggregate  of the  Investment  of such  Portions  of  Investment;
provided, further there shall at no time be more than five Yield Periods.

         Section 1.8.  Increased  Costs.  (a) If the Agent,  the Purchaser,  any
Liquidity  Bank, any other Program Support  Provider or any of their  respective
Affiliates  (each an  "Affected  Person")  determines  that the  existence of or
compliance  with  (i) any law or  regulation  or any  change  therein  or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case adopted, issued or occurring
after the date  hereof or (ii) any  request,  guideline  or  directive  from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of
law)  issued or  occurring  after the date of this  Agreement  affects  or would
affect the amount of capital  required  or  expected  to be  maintained  by such
Affected  Person and such  Affected  Person  determines  that the amount of such
capital is increased by or based upon the  existence of any  commitment  to make
purchases of or otherwise to maintain the investment in Pool Receivables related
to this  Agreement  or any  related  liquidity  facility  or credit  enhancement
facility  and other  commitments  of the same type,  then,  upon  demand by such
Affected Person (with a copy to the Agent),  the Seller shall immediately pay to
the  Agent,  for the  account  of such  Affected  Person,  from  time to time as
specified by such Affected Person,  additional  amounts sufficient to compensate
such Affected Person in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such
Affected Person  reasonably  determines such increase in capital to be allocable
to the existence of any of such commitments;  provided that within 30 days of an
Affected Party's  knowledge of any such  circumstance  such Affected Party shall
notify the Seller of the same and whether such Affected  Party will request that
the Seller indemnify it for such circumstance.  A certificate as to such amounts
submitted  to the  Seller  and  the  Agent  by such  Affected  Person  shall  be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than
any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements  referred to
in Section 1.9) in or in the  interpretation  of any law or  regulation  or (ii)
compliance  with  any  guideline  or  request  from  any  central  bank or other

                                      -9-

Governmental  Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any  increase  in the cost to any  Affected  Person of  agreeing  to purchase or
purchasing,  or  maintaining  the ownership of the  Participation  in respect of
which  Discount is computed by  reference to the  Eurodollar  Rate,  then,  upon
demand  by such  Affected  Person,  the  Seller  shall  immediately  pay to such
Affected Person,  from time to time as specified,  additional amounts sufficient
to  compensate  such Affected  Person for such  increased  costs;  provided that
within 30 days of an Affected Party's  knowledge of any such  circumstance  such
Affected  Party shall  notify the Seller of the same and whether  such  Affected
Party  will  request  that the  Seller  indemnify  it for such  circumstance.  A
certificate as to such amounts  submitted to the Seller by such Affected  Person
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         Section 1.9. Additional Discount on Portions of Participation Bearing a
Eurodollar  Rate. The Seller shall pay to any Affected  Person,  so long as such
Affected Person shall be required under regulations of the Board of Governors of
the Federal  Reserve System to maintain  reserves with respect to liabilities or
assets  consisting  of  or  including  "Eurocurrency  Liabilities",   additional
Discount on the unpaid Investment of the applicable Portion of Investment during
each Yield  Period in respect of which  Discount is computed by reference to the
Eurodollar  Rate, for such Yield Period,  at a rate per annum equal at all times
during  such Yield  Period to the  remainder  obtained  by  subtracting  (i) the
Eurodollar  Rate for such Yield  Period from (ii) the rate  obtained by dividing
such Eurodollar Rate referred to in clause (i) above by that percentage equal to
100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage for such Yield Period, payable
on  each  date on  which  Discount  is  payable  on the  applicable  Portion  of
Investment; provided that within 30 days of an Affected Party's knowledge of any
such  circumstance  such Affected  Party shall notify the Seller of the same and
whether such Affected  Party will request that the Seller  indemnify it for such
circumstance.  Such  additional  Discount  shall be  determined  by the Affected
Person and notified to the Seller  through the Agent.  A certificate  as to such
additional  Discount  submitted  to the Seller by the  Affected  Person shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         Section  1.10.  Requirements  of Law.  In the event  that any  Affected
Person  determines  that  the  existence  of or  compliance  with (i) any law or
regulation  or any  change  therein  or in  the  interpretation  or  application
thereof, in each case adopted, issued or occurring after the date hereof or (ii)
any request,  

                                      -10-

guideline or directive  from any central  bank or other  Governmental  Authority
(whether or not having the force of law) issued or  occurring  after the date of
this Agreement:

                  (i) does or shall subject such  Affected  Person to any tax of
         any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any increase in the
         Participation or in the amount of Investment  relating thereto, or does
         or shall  change the basis of taxation  of  payments  to such  Affected
         Person on account of Collections, Discount or any other amounts payable
         hereunder  (excluding  taxes  imposed on the overall net income of such
         Affected  Person,  and franchise taxes imposed on such Affected Person,
         by the  jurisdiction  under the laws of which such  Affected  Person is
         organized or a political subdivision thereof);

                  (ii)  does or shall  impose,  modify  or hold  applicable  any
         reserve,  special  deposit,  compulsory  loan  or  similar  requirement
         against assets held by, or deposits or other  liabilities in or for the
         account of,  purchases,  advances or loans by, or other credit extended
         by, or any other  acquisition  of funds by, any office of such Affected
         Person which are not  otherwise  included in the  determination  of the
         Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate hereunder; or

                  (iii) does or shall impose on such  Affected  Person any other
         condition;

and the  result  of any of the  foregoing  is (x) to  increase  the cost to such
Affected  Person of acting as Agent, or of agreeing to purchase or purchasing or
maintaining  the ownership of undivided  ownership  interests with regard to the
Participation (or interests  therein) or any Portion of Investment in respect of
which Discount is computed by reference to the Eurodollar  Rate or the Base Rate
or  (y)  to  reduce  any  amount  receivable   hereunder  (whether  directly  or
indirectly) funded or maintained by reference to the Eurodollar Rate or the Base
Rate,  then, in any such case,  upon demand by such  Affected  Person the Seller
shall pay such Affected  Person any additional  amounts  necessary to compensate
such Affected Person for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable.  All
such amounts  shall be payable as incurred.  A  certificate  from such  Affected
Person to the Seller certifying,  in reasonably  specific detail, the basis for,
calculation of, and amount of such additional costs or reduced amount receivable
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error; provided, however, that no
Affected  Person shall be required to disclose any  confidential or tax planning
information in any such certificate.

         Section 1.11. Inability to Determine Eurodollar Rate. In the event that
the Agent  shall  have  determined  prior to the  first 

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

day of any Yield Period (which  determination  shall be  conclusive  and binding
upon the parties  hereto) by reason of  circumstances  affecting  the  interbank
Eurodollar  market,  either (a) dollar deposits in the relevant  amounts and for
the relevant Yield Period are not available,  (b) adequate and reasonable  means
do not exist for  ascertaining  the Eurodollar Rate for such Yield Period or (c)
the Eurodollar Rate determined  pursuant hereto does not accurately  reflect the
cost to the Purchaser (as  conclusively  determined by the Agent) of maintaining
any Portion of  Investment  during such Yield Period,  the Agent shall  promptly
give  telephonic  notice of such  determination,  confirmed  in writing,  to the
Seller prior to the first day of such Yield Period. Upon delivery of such notice
(a) no  Portion  of  Investment  shall be  funded  thereafter  at the Bank  Rate
determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, unless and until the Agent shall
have  given  notice to the Seller  that the  circumstances  giving  rise to such
determination no longer exist, and (b) with respect to any outstanding  Portions
of  Investment  then  funded at the Bank Rate  determined  by  reference  to the
Eurodollar  Rate,  such Bank Rate shall  automatically  be converted to the Bank
Rate determined by reference to the Base Rate at the respective last days of the
then-current Yield Periods relating to such Portions of Investment.

Termination Date shall occur. Upon any such  declaration,  the occurrence or the
deemed  occurrence of the  Termination  Date,  the Purchaser and the Agent shall

Agreement,  all other rights and remedies  provided  after default under the UCC

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         Section  3.1.  Indemnities  by the Seller.  Without  limiting any other
rights that the Agent or the  Purchaser or any of their  respective  Affiliates,
employees,  agents,  successors,  transferees or assigns (each,  an "Indemnified
Party") may have hereunder or under  applicable law, the Seller hereby agrees to
indemnify each Indemnified  Party from and against any and all claims,  damages,
expenses,  losses  and  liabilities  (including  Attorney  Costs)  (all  of  the
foregoing being collectively  referred to as "Indemnified  Amounts") arising out
of or resulting  from this  Agreement or other  Transaction  Documents  (whether
directly or indirectly) or the use of proceeds of purchases or  reinvestments or
the ownership of the  Participation,  or any interest therein,  or in respect of
any  Receivable  or any  Contract  regardless  of whether  any such  Indemnified
Amounts result from an  Indemnified  Party's  negligence or strict  liability or
other  acts or  omissions  of an  Indemnified  Party,  excluding,  however,  (a)
Indemnified  Amounts to the extent  resulting  from gross  negligence or willful
misconduct  on the part of such  Indemnified  Party,  (b)  recourse  (except  as
otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) for uncollectible Receivables
to be written off consistent with the Credit and Collection  Policy,  or (c) any
overall net income taxes or franchise taxes imposed on such Indemnified Party by
the jurisdiction  under the laws of which such Indemnified Party is organized or
any  political  subdivision  thereof.  Without  limiting or being limited by the
foregoing,  and subject to the exclusions  set forth in the preceding  sentence,

         Pool and the  Related  Security  and  Collections  in respect  thereof,
         whether  at  the  time  of  any  purchase  or  reinvestment  or at  any

         litigation  or proceeding  arising out of or in connection  with goods,
         insurance or services that are the subject of or secure any Contract;

                  (ix) the commingling of Collections of Pool Receivables at any

         purchases or  reinvestments or the ownership of the Participation or in
         respect of any  Receivable, Related Security or Contract;

                  (xi)  any   reduction  in   Investment  as  a  result  of  the
         distribution of Collections  pursuant to Section  1.4(d),  in the event

         interests  in the  Receivables  Pool  or in  any  Related  Security  or
         Contract.

         If for any reason the  indemnification  provided  above in this Section
3.1 is  unavailable  to an  Indemnified  Party or is  insufficient  to hold such
Indemnified Party harmless, then the Seller shall contribute to such Indemnified
Party the amount otherwise payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
loss,  claim,  damage  or  liability  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  under
applicable law.

         Section  3.2.  Indemnities  by AFC.  Without  limiting any other rights
which any such person may have hereunder under applicable law, AFC hereby agrees
to indemnify each Indemnified Party,  forthwith on demand,  from and against any

result from an Indemnified  Party's negligence or strict liability or other acts
or omissions of an Indemnified Party, awarded against or incurred by any of them
arising out of or relating to:

                  (i) the failure of any Receivable  included in the calculation

         hereto,  which shall have been false, incorrect or  misleading  in any
         material  respect when made or deemed made;

                  (iii) the failure by AFC,  in its  capacity  as  Servicer,  to
         comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation  (including truth in
         lending,  fair credit  billing,  usury,  fair credit  reporting,  equal
         credit  opportunity,  fair debt collection  practices and privacy) with
         respect to any Pool Receivable or other related contract; or

                  (iv) any failure of AFC to perform its duties,  covenants  and
         obligations  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  provisions  of this
         Agreement.

         If for any reason the  indemnification  provided  above in this Section
3.2 is  unavailable  to an  Indemnified  Party or is  insufficient  to hold such
Indemnified Party harmless,  then AFC shall contribute to such Indemnified Party
the amount otherwise payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss,
claim, damage or liability to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.


                                   ARTICLE IV.

                         ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTIONS

         Section 4.1. Appointment of Servicer. (a) The servicing,  administering
and  collection  of the Pool  Receivables  shall be  conducted  by the Person so
designated  from time to time as Servicer in  accordance  with this Section 4.1.
Until the Agent gives notice to the Seller and the Servicer (in accordance  with
this Section 4.1) of the designation of a new Servicer, AFC is hereby designated
as, and hereby  agrees to perform the duties and  obligations  of, the  Servicer
pursuant to the terms hereof.  Upon the occurrence of a Termination  Event,  the
Agent may  designate  as Servicer any Person  (including  itself) to succeed the
Servicer or any successor Servicer,  on the condition in each case that any such
Person so designated  shall agree to perform the duties and  obligations  of the
Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof.

         (b)  Upon the  designation  of a  successor  Servicer  as set  forth in
Section 4.1(a) hereof, the Servicer agrees that it will terminate its activities
as Servicer hereunder in a manner which the Agent determines will facilitate the
transition of the  performance of such  activities to the new Servicer,  and the
Servicer  shall  cooperate with and assist such new Servicer.  Such  cooperation
shall include (without  limitation) access to and transfer of records and use by
the new Servicer of all licenses, hardware or software necessary or desirable to
collect the Pool Receivables and the Related Security.

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

         (c) The Servicer acknowledges that, in making their decision to execute
and  deliver  this  Agreement,  the Agent and the  Purchaser  have relied on the
Servicer's  agreement to act as Servicer  hereunder.  Accordingly,  the Servicer
agrees that it will not voluntarily resign as Servicer.

         (d) The Servicer may delegate its duties and  obligations  hereunder to
any  subservicer  (each,  a   "Sub-Servicer");   provided  that,  in  each  such
delegation,  (i) such Sub-Servicer  shall agree in writing to perform the duties
and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof,  (ii) the Servicer
shall remain primarily liable to the Purchaser and the Agent for the performance
of the duties and obligations so delegated,  (iii) the Seller, the Agent and the
Purchaser  shall  have  the  right  to look  solely  to the  Servicer  for  such
performance  and (iv) the terms of any  agreement  with any  Sub-Servicer  shall
provide that the Agent may terminate such agreement upon the  termination of the
Servicer in accordance  with Section 4.1(a) above  hereunder by giving notice of
its desire to terminate  such  agreement to the Servicer (and the Servicer shall
provide appropriate notice to such Sub-Servicer).

         Section 4.2.  Duties of Servicer.  (a) The Servicer shall take or cause
to be taken all such action as may be  necessary  or  advisable  to collect each
Pool Receivable from time to time, all in accordance with this Agreement and all
applicable laws, rules and regulations,  with reasonable care and diligence, and
in accordance  with the Credit and  Collection  Policy.  The Servicer  shall set
aside  for the  accounts  of the  Seller  and the  Purchaser  the  amount of the
Collections to which each is entitled in accordance with Article II hereto.  The
Seller shall deliver to the Servicer and the Servicer shall hold for the benefit
of the Seller and the Agent (for the benefit of the Purchaser and  individually)
in  accordance  with their  respective  interests,  all  records  and  documents
(including without limitation computer tapes or disks) with respect to each Pool
Receivable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Agent
may direct  the  Servicer  to  commence  or settle  any legal  action to enforce
collection of any Pool  Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related
Security;  provided,  however,  that no such  direction  may be  given  unless a
Termination Event has occurred.

         (b) The Servicer's  obligations  hereunder shall terminate on the Final
Payout Date.

         After such  termination,  the Servicer  shall  promptly  deliver to the
Seller all books,  records  and  related  materials  that the Seller  previously
provided to the Servicer in connection with this Agreement.

         Section  4.3.  Deposit  Accounts;  Establishment  and  Use  of  Certain
Accounts.

         (a) Deposit Accounts. Servicer agrees to transfer ownership and control
of the Deposit  Accounts to the Seller no later than  January 31,  1997.  Seller
agrees that if the Agent so requests it shall grant a valid  perfected  security
interest in each  Deposit  Account to the  Purchaser  pursuant to  documentation
satisfactory to the Agent.

         (b) Collection Account. The Servicer agrees to establish the Collection
Account on or before the date of the first  purchase  hereunder.  The Collection
Account  shall be used to accept the  transfer of  Collections  from the Deposit
Accounts pursuant to Section 1.4(b) and for such other purposes described in the
Transaction Documents.

         (c)  Liquidation   Account.   The  Servicer  agrees  to  establish  the
Liquidation Account on or before the date of the first purchase  hereunder.  The
Liquidation Account shall be used to receive transfers of certain amounts of the
Purchaser's  share of  Collections of Pool  Receivables  prior to the Settlement
Dates and for such other purposes  described in the  Transaction  Documents.  No
funds  other than those  transferred  in  accordance  with  Section 1.4 shall be
intentionally transferred into the Liquidation Account.

         (d) Permitted  Investments.  Any amounts in the Liquidation  Account or
the Collection  Account,  as the case may be, may be invested by the Liquidation
Account  Bank  or the  Collection  Account  Bank,  respectively,  at  Servicer's
direction,  in Permitted  Investments,  so long as Purchaser's  interest in such
Permitted  Investments  is perfected in a manner  satisfactory  to Purchaser and
such Permitted  Investments are subject to no Adverse Claims other than those of
the Purchaser provided hereunder.

         (e) Control of Accounts.  The Agent may following any Termination Event
(or an Unmatured  Termination  Event of the type  described in paragraph  (g) of
Exhibit  V) at any time  give  notice  to the  Collection  Account  Bank and the
Liquidation  Account  Bank that the Agent is  exercising  its  rights  under the
Collection Account Agreement and the Liquidation  Account Agreement to do any or
all of the  following:  (i) to have the  exclusive  ownership and control of the
Collection Account and the Liquidation  Account  transferred to the Agent and to
exercise  exclusive  dominion and control over the funds  deposited  therein and
(ii) to take any or all other actions  permitted  under the  Collection  Account
Agreement and the Liquidation  Account Agreement.  The Seller hereby agrees that
if the Agent at any time takes any action set forth in the  preceding  sentence,
the Agent shall have exclusive control of the proceeds  (including  Collections)
of all Pool  

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Receivables  and the Seller hereby  further agrees to take any other action that
the Agent may reasonably request to transfer such control.  Any proceeds of Pool
Receivables  received by the Seller, as Servicer or otherwise,  thereafter shall
be sent immediately to the Agent. The parties hereto hereby  acknowledge that if
at any time the Agent takes control of the Collection  Account,  the Liquidation
Account or any Deposit Account, the Agent shall not have any rights to the funds
therein in excess of the unpaid  amounts due to the Agent,  the Purchaser or any
other Person hereunder.

         Section  4.4.  Enforcement  Rights.  (a)  At  any  time  following  the
occurrence of a Termination Event:

                  (i) the Agent may  direct  the  Obligors  that  payment of all
         amounts payable under any Pool Receivable be made directly to the Agent
         or its designee;

                  (ii) the Agent may instruct the Seller or the Servicer to give
         notice of the Purchaser's interest in Pool Receivables to each Obligor,
         which notice shall direct that  payments be made  directly to the Agent
         or its designee, and upon such instruction from the Agent the Seller or
         the Servicer,  as applicable,  shall give such notice at the expense of
         the Seller;  provided,  that if the Seller or the Servicer  fails to so
         notify each Obligor, the Agent may so notify the Obligors; and

                  (iii) the Agent may request the Seller or the Servicer to, and
         upon such request the Seller or the Servicer, as applicable, shall, (A)
         assemble all of the records  necessary or desirable to collect the Pool
         Receivables  and the Related  Security,  and transfer or license to any
         new Servicer the use of all software  necessary or desirable to collect
         the  Pool  Receivables  and the  Related  Security,  and  make the same
         available  to the  Agent or its  designee  at a place  selected  by the
         Agent,  and (B)  segregate  all  cash,  checks  and  other  instruments
         received by it from time to time constituting  Collections with respect
         to the  Pool  Receivables  in a manner  acceptable  to the  Agent  and,
         promptly upon  receipt,  remit all such cash,  checks and  instruments,
         duly endorsed or with duly  executed  instruments  of transfer,  to the
         Agent or its designee.

         (b) The Seller hereby  authorizes the Agent,  and irrevocably  appoints
the Agent as its attorney-in-fact  with full power of substitution and with full
authority  in the place and stead of the Seller,  which  appointment  is coupled
with an  interest,  to take any and all steps in the name of the  Seller  and on
behalf of the Seller necessary or desirable,  in the determination of the Agent,
to collect any and all  amounts or  portions  thereof due

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

under any and all Pool  Receivables  or  Related  Security,  including,  without
limitation,  endorsing  the name of the Seller on checks  and other  instruments
representing  Collections and enforcing such Pool Receivables,  Related Security
and the related Contracts. The Agent shall only exercise the powers construed by
this subsection (b) after the occurrence of a Termination Event. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary  contained in this  subsection  (b), none of the powers
conferred  upon such  attorney-in-fact  pursuant  to the  immediately  preceding
sentence  shall  subject such  attorney-in-fact  to any  liability if any action
taken by it shall prove to be inadequate  or invalid,  nor shall they confer any
obligations upon such attorney-in-fact in any manner whatsoever.

         Section 4.5.  Responsibilities  of the Seller.  Anything  herein to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  the Seller shall (i) perform all of its obligations,
if any, under the Contracts  related to the Pool  Receivables to the same extent
as if interests in such Pool Receivables had not been transferred hereunder, and
the  exercise by the Agent or the  Purchaser of its rights  hereunder  shall not
relieve  the  Seller  from  such  obligations  and (ii) pay when due any  taxes,
including,  without  limitation,  any sales taxes payable in connection with the
Pool  Receivables  and  their  creation  and  satisfaction.  The  Agent  and the
Purchaser  shall not have any  obligation or liability  with respect to any Pool
Receivable,  any Related Security or any related Contract, nor shall any of them
be obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Seller or AFC under any of
the foregoing.

         Section 4.6.  Servicing Fee. The Servicer shall be paid a fee,  through
distributions contemplated by Section 1.4(d), equal to (a) at any time AFC or an
Affiliate  of  AFC is  the  Servicer,  2% per  annum  of the  average  aggregate
Outstanding Balance of all Receivables,  and (b) at any time a Person other than
AFC or an  Affiliate  of AFC is the  Servicer,  110% of the  Servicer's  cost of
acting as Servicer.


                                   ARTICLE V.

the  case of any  amendment,  by the  Seller  and the  Servicer  and  then  such
amendment,  waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance
and for the  specific  purpose  for which  given.  No failure on the part of the
Purchaser or Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, 

                                      -20-

hereunder  shall,  unless  otherwise  stated herein,  be in writing (which shall

participating  interest to a Liquidity Bank or other Program  Support  Provider,
the Purchaser  shall remain  responsible  for the performance of its obligations
hereunder.  The Seller agrees that

         (c)  This  Agreement  and  the  rights  and  obligations  of the  Agent
hereunder  shall  be  assignable,  in whole or in  part,  by the  Agent  and its
successors and assigns;  provided,  however,  that if such  assignment is to any
Person who is not an  Affiliate  of the Agent,  the Agent must receive the prior

waiver) in any year  shall not exceed  $15,000),  and all  reasonable  costs and

         extends  the due date to a date  more  than 90 days  past the date such
         Receivable  arose  (provided  that the  determination  of such due date
         shall include any extension that extends the due date to a date between

All purchases and contributions  hereunder shall be made without  recourse,  but
shall be made pursuant to and in reliance upon the  representations,  warranties
and covenants of the Originator, in its capacity as seller and contributor,  set
forth in each  Transaction  Document.  The  Company's  foregoing  commitment  to
purchase such  Receivables and the proceeds and rights  described in subsections
(c) through (f) of this Section 1.1 (collectively,  including such item relating
to Contributed Receivables, the "Related Rights") is herein called the "Purchase
Facility."

     1.2 Timing of Purchases.

     (a) Closing  Date  Purchases.  The  Originator's  entire  right,  title and
interest in (i) each  Receivable that existed and was owing to the Originator as
of the opening of the  Originator's  business on the Closing  Date,  (other than
Contributed  Receivables) and (ii) all Related Rights with respect thereto shall
be sold to the Company on the Closing Date.

     (b) Regular  Purchases.  After the Closing Date, each Receivable created or
originated by the Originator and all Related Rights shall be purchased and owned
by the Company  (without any further action) upon the creation or origination of
such Receivable.

     1.3.  Consideration  for  Purchases.  On  the  terms  and  subject  to  the
conditions set forth in this Agreement,  the Company agrees to make all Purchase
Price payments to the Originator.

     1.4. Purchase and Sale Termination Date. The "Purchase and Sale Termination
Date" shall be the earlier to occur of (a) the date of the  termination  of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 and (b) the Payment Date immediately following
the day on which the Originator  shall have given notice to the Company that the
Originator desires to terminate this Agreement.

     As used  herein,  "Payment  Date" means (i) the Closing  Date and (ii) each
Business Day thereafter that the Originator is open for business.

     1.5.  Intention  of the  Parties.  It is the express  intent of the parties
hereto  that  the  transfers  of  the   Receivables   (other  than   Contributed
Receivables)  and Related Rights (other than those  relating to the  Contributed
Receivables) by the Originator to the Company, as contemplated by this Agreement
be, and be treated as, sales and not as secured loans secured by the Receivables
and Related Rights. If, however, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, such
transactions are deemed to be loans, the Originator hereby grants to the Company
a first priority security interest in all of the Originator's  right,  title and
interest in and to the  Receivables  and the  Related  Rights now  existing  and
hereafter

                                      -3-

created,  all monies due or to become due and all amounts  received with respect
thereto, and all proceeds thereof, to secure all of the Originator's obligations
hereunder.

     Agreement or any other  Transaction  Document to which it is a party or the
     performance of any such obligations;

          (v) the collectibility of the Receivables.

          "Solvent"  means,  with respect to any Person at any time, a condition
under which:

          (i) the fair value and present fair  saleable  value of such  Person's

     total liabilities  (including  contingent and unliquidated  liabilities) at
     such time;

     realized within a reasonable time either through collection or sale of such
     asset at its regular market value;

          (C) the "regular market value" of an asset shall be the amount which a
     capable and  diligent  business  person could obtain for such asset from an
     interested  buyer who is willing to  purchase  such  asset  under  ordinary
     selling conditions; and

          (D) the  "present  fair  saleable  value" of an asset means the amount

                                   ARTICLE II

                          CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE

     2.1.  Calculation  of Purchase  Price.  On each Servicer  Report Date,  the
Servicer  shall  deliver to the Company,  the Agent and the  Originator  (if the
Servicer is other than the  Originator)  a report in  substantially  the form of
Exhibit A (each such  report  being  herein  called a  "Purchase  Report")  with
respect  to the  matters  set  forth  therein  and the  Company's  purchases  of
Receivables from the Originator

     (a) that are to be made on the  Closing  Date (in the case of the  Purchase
Report to be delivered on the Closing Date), or

     (b) that were made during the period commencing on the Servicer Report Date
immediately  preceding  such Servicer  Report Date to (but not  including)  such
Servicer Report Date (in the case of each subsequent Purchase Report).

The "Purchase  Price" (to be paid to the Originator in accordance with the terms
of Article III) for the  Receivables  and the Related  Rights that are purchased
hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:

     PP       =        OB X PDRR

     where:

     PP       =        Purchase  Price for each  Receivable as calculated on
                       the relevant Payment Date.

     OB       =        the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable at the time
                       of origination.

     PDRR     =        the Purchase Discount Rate Reserve Ratio.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

     "Purchase Discount Rate Reserve Ratio" means a percentage calculated in the
most recent Purchase Report in accordance with the following formula:

     PDRR     =         TD       x  (DR + PD)
                       ---
                       360

     where:

     PDRR     =        the Purchase Discount Rate Reserve Ratio;

     TD       =        the  Turnover  Days  for  Receivables  generated  by the
                       Originator  during  the  prior calendar month;

     DR       =        the Discount Rate; and

     PD       =        a profit discount equal to 0.15%.

     "Turnover  Days" means, as calculated in any Purchase  Report,  that period
(expressed  in days)  calculated  as the product of (a) the  quotient of (i) the
aggregate Outstanding Balance of Receivables  originated by the Originator as of
the last day of the calendar month which occurs two months prior to the month to
which the Purchase Report relates,  divided by (ii) the aggregate  amount of the
Collections  received  during the prior  calendar  month,  multiplied by (b) the
number of days in the prior calendar month.

     "Accrued  Carrying Costs" means, as of any date, the sum of (i) accrued and
unpaid Carrying Costs as of such date, plus (ii) without duplication, the amount
of Carrying  Costs that will,  or are estimated by the Servicer to, have accrued
by the next  Servicer  Report Date as set forth in the  then-effective  Purchase
Report.

     "Carrying  Costs"  means  any of the  following  items:  (i) yield and fees
payable by the Company to the  Purchaser  and the Agent;  (ii)  Ordinary  Course
Expenses of the Company; and (iii) the Servicing Fee.

     "Ordinary  Course  Expenses"  means the  expenses  of the  Company  for the
allocation  of  employee  salaries,  benefits,  directors'  fees,  office  lease
payments,  office equipment (including  computers and related software),  office
supplies,  Federal,  state and local taxes and similar expenses  incurred in the
ordinary  course of its  business  other  than (a)  interest  expense  under the
Company  Note  and  (b)  other  Carrying  Costs  specifically  mentioned  in the
definition of Carrying Costs.

     "Discount  Rate"  means,   commencing  on  any  Servicer  Report  Date  and
continuing  until (but not including) the next Servicer Report Date, the blended
per annum rate at which Discount accrued on the Participation as of the last day
of the immediately  preceding

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

calendar month, plus a fraction,  the numerator of
which  equals  the  Accrued   Carrying   Costs  (other  than   Discount  on  the
Participation  or interest on the Company  Note) for the  immediately  preceding
calendar month,  and the  denominator of which equals the aggregate  Outstanding
Balance  of all  Receivables  as of the  last day of the  immediately  preceding
calendar month. The Discount Rate from the Closing Date until the first Servicer
Report Date shall be 5.45%.

                                  ARTICLE III

                          CONTRIBUTION OF RECEIVABLES;
                            PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE

     3.1.  Contribution  of  Receivables.  On the Closing Date,  the  Originator
shall,  and hereby does,  contribute to the capital of the Company,  Receivables
and Related  Rights with respect  thereto  consisting of each  Receivable of the
Originator that existed and was owing to the Originator on the Closing Date that
as of such date was not an Eligible  Receivable and Receivables that existed and
were  owing to the  Originator  on the  Closing  Date  that as of such date were
Eligible Receivables, beginning with the oldest of such Eligible Receivables and
continuing  chronologically  thereafter, and all or an undivided interest in the
most recent of such  contributed  Eligible  Receivables  such that the aggregate
Outstanding  Balance  of all  such  contributed  Receivables  shall  be equal to
$1,000,000.

     3.2.  Initial  Purchase  Price  Payment.  On the terms and  subject  to the
conditions  set  forth  in this  Agreement,  the  Company  agrees  to pay to the
Originator  the Purchase Price for the purchase of Receivables to be made on the
Closing  Date,  partially  in cash in the amount of the proceeds of the Purchase
made by the  Purchaser  on the  Closing  Date  under  the  Receivables  Purchase
Agreement,  and partially by issuing a promissory  note in the form of Exhibit B
to the  Originator  with an initial  principal  balance  equal to the  remaining
Purchase Price (as such promissory note may be amended,  supplemented,  indorsed
or otherwise  modified  from time to time,  together with all  promissory  notes
issued  from  time  to time in  substitution  therefor  or  renewal  thereof  in
accordance  with the  Transaction  Documents,  being herein  called the "Company
Note").

     3.3. Subsequent Purchase Price Payments. On each Business Day falling after
the Closing Date and on or prior to the Purchase and Sale  Termination  Date, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company
shall pay to the Originator the Purchase Price for the  Receivables  sold by the
Originator to the Company on such Business Day, in cash, to the extent funds are
available to make such payment and such payment is permitted by paragraph (o) of
Exhibit IV to the Receivables Purchase Agreement,  and to the extent any of such
Purchase Price

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

remains unpaid,  such remaining  portion of such Purchase Price shall be paid by
means of an  automatic  increase  to the  outstanding  principal  amount  of the
Company Note.

     Servicer shall make all appropriate  record keeping entries with respect to
the Company Note or otherwise to reflect the foregoing  payments and adjustments
pursuant to Section  3.4,  and  Servicer's  books and records  shall  constitute
rebuttable  presumptive evidence of the principal amount of and accrued interest
on the Company Note at any time.  Furthermore,  Servicer  shall hold the Company
Note for the benefit of the Originator,  and all payments under the Company Note
shall be made to the Servicer for the account of the  applicable  payee thereof.
The Originator hereby irrevocably  authorizes  Servicer to mark the Company Note
"CANCELLED" and to return the Company Note to the Company upon the final payment
thereof after the occurrence of the Purchase and Sale Termination Date.

     3.4. Settlement as to Specific Receivables and Dilution.

     (a) If on the day of purchase or  contribution  of any Receivable  from the
Originator  hereunder,  any of the  representations  or warranties  set forth in
Section 5.4,  5.11 or 5.20 is not true with respect to such  Receivable  or as a
result  of any  action  or  inaction  of the  Originator,  on any day any of the
representations  or  warranties  set forth in  Section  5.4,  5.11 or 5.20 is no
longer true with  respect to such a  Receivable,  then the  Purchase  Price with
respect to the  Receivables  purchased  hereunder  shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the  Outstanding  Balance of such  Receivable and shall be accounted to
the  Originator  as  provided in  subsection  (c) below;  provided,  that if the
Company  thereafter  receives payment on account of Collections due with respect
to such  Receivable,  the  Company  promptly  shall  deliver  such  funds to the
Originator.

     (b) If, on any day, the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable  purchased or
contributed hereunder is reduced or adjusted as a result of any discount, rebate
or other adjustment made by the Originator, Company or Servicer or any setoff or
dispute between the Seller, the Originator or the Servicer and an Obligor,  then
the Purchase Price with respect to the Receivables  purchased hereunder shall be
reduced by the amount of such reduction and shall be accounted to the Originator
as provided in subsection (c) below.

     (c) Any  reduction in the  Purchase  Price of the  Receivables  pursuant to
subsection  (a) or (b) above shall be applied as a credit for the account of the
Company against the Purchase Price of Receivables  subsequently purchased by the
Company from the Originator hereunder;  provided,  however if there have been no
purchases of Receivables (or  insufficiently  large purchases of Receivables) to
create a Purchase Price  sufficient to so apply such

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

credit against,  the amount of such credit

          (i)  shall be paid in cash to the  Company  by the  Originator  in the
     manner and for application as described in the following proviso, or

          (ii) shall be deemed to be a payment under, and shall be deducted from
     the principal  amount  outstanding  under,  the Company Note, to the extent
     that such payment is  permitted  under  paragraph  (o) of Exhibit IV of the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement;

provided,  further,  that at any time (y) when a Termination  Event or Unmatured
Termination  Event exists or (z) on or after the Termination Date, the amount of
any such  credit  shall be paid by the  Originator  to the Company by deposit in
immediately  available  funds into the  Collection  Account for  application  by
Servicer to the same extent as if Collections  of the  applicable  Receivable in
such amount had actually been received on such date.

     (d) Each Purchase Report (other than the Purchase  Report  delivered on the
Closing Date) shall include, in respect of the Receivables  previously generated
by the Originator (including the Contributed Receivables),  a calculation of the
aggregate  reductions  described  in  subsection  (a) or (b)  relating  to  such
Receivables since the last Purchase Report delivered hereunder.

     3.5. Reconveyance of Receivables. In the event that the Originator has paid
to the  Company  the full  Outstanding  Balance of any  Receivable  pursuant  to
Section 3.4, the Company  shall  reconvey  such  Receivable  to the  Originator,
without  representation or warranty,  but free and clear of all liens created by
the Company.

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ORIGINATOR

     In order to induce the  Company to enter  into this  Agreement  and to make
purchases and accept contributions hereunder, the Originator, in its capacity as
seller under this Agreement, hereby makes the representations and warranties set
forth in this Article V.

     5.1.  Organization  and  Good  Standing.   The  Originator  has  been  duly
incorporated  and in existence as a  corporation  under the laws of the state of
its incorporation, with power and authority to own its properties and to conduct
its  business  as such  properties  are  presently  owned and such  business  is
presently conducted.

     5.2. Due Qualification.  The Originator is duly licensed or qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation in good standing in the jurisdiction where its
chief  executive  office and principal  place of business are located and in all
other  jurisdictions  in which the  ownership  or lease of its  property  or the
conduct of its business  requires such licensing or  qualification  except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified has not had and could not  reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

     5.3. Power and  Authority;  Due  Authorization.  The Originator has (a) all

contribution,  as the case may be, of Receivables and Related Rights made by the
Originator  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  constitute  a  valid  sale  or

bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization  or other  similar laws  affecting  the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general  principles of equity,
regardless  of whether such  enforceability  is  considered  in a proceeding  in
equity or at law.

     5.5 No Violation. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Originator is a party
as seller,  and the  fulfillment  of the terms  hereof or  thereof  will not (a)
conflict  with,  result in any breach of any of the terms and  provisions of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under (i)
the Originator's  articles of  incorporation or by-laws,  or (ii) any indenture,

notwithstanding:

     (a) The  Originator  agrees to transfer  any  Collections  that it receives
directly to a Deposit  Account within one Business Day of receipt  thereof,  and
agrees that all such  Collections  shall be segregated and held in trust for the
Company  and the  Purchaser;  provided  that if the  Company or the  Servicer is
required  by  Section  4.4  of  the  Receivables  Purchase  Agreement  to  remit
Collections  directly to the Agent (or its designee) the Originator  shall remit
such  Collections  directly to the Agent (or its designee) in the same manner as
the  Company  and  Servicer  may be  required  to do so by Section  4.4.  of the
Receivables Purchase Agreement. The Originator further agrees not to deposit any
funds other than Collections in a Deposit Account.

     (b)  The  Originator  shall  perform  its  obligations  hereunder,  and the
exercise  by the  Company  or its  designee  of its rights

Originator),  Purchaser  or  the  Agent  be  obligated  to  perform  any  of the
obligations of the Originator thereunder.

     (d) The Originator hereby grants to Servicer (if other than the Originator)
an irrevocable power of attorney, with full power of substitution,  coupled with
an  interest,  to take in the name of the  Originator  all  steps  necessary  or
advisable to indorse,  negotiate  or  otherwise  realize on any writing or other
right of any kind  held or  transmitted  by the  Originator  or  transmitted  or
received by the Company  (whether or not from the Originator) in connection with
any Receivable or Related Right.

     7.3. Further Action Evidencing  Purchases.  The Originator agrees that from
time to time, at its expense,  it will promptly  execute and deliver all further
instruments  and  documents,  and take all  further  action  that the Company or
Servicer  may  reasonably  request  in order to  perfect,  protect or more fully
evidence the Receivables  (and the Related Rights)  purchased by, or contributed
to, the Company  hereunder,  or to enable the Company to exercise or enforce any
of its  rights  hereunder  or under  any  other  Transaction  Document.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Originator will:

perform any of its agreements or obligations  under this Agreement,  the Company
or its  designee  may (but shall not be required  to) itself  perform,  or cause
performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the Company or
its designee incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Originator
as provided in Section 10.6.

     Facility  to which the  Company may be  otherwise  appropriately  entitled,
     whether at law or equity.


                                   ARTICLE IX
    
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     9.1. Indemnities by the Originator. Without limiting any other rights which
the Company may have hereunder or under  applicable  law, the Originator  hereby
agrees to indemnify  the  Company,  the  Purchaser,  the Agent and each of their
respective  assigns,  officers,  directors,  employees  and agents  (each of the
foregoing  Persons being  individually  called a "Purchase and Sale  Indemnified
Party"),  forthwith  on demand,  from and against any and all  damages,  losses,
claims,  judgments,  liabilities  and  related  costs  and  expenses,  including
reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements  (all  of the  foregoing  being
collectively  called  "Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Amounts"),  regardless of
whether  any such  Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Amount  is the  result  of a
Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party's negligence, strict liability or other acts
or  omissions  of a Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party,  awarded  against or
incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of the following:

     (a) the  transfer by the  Originator  of an interest in any  Receivable  or
Related Right to any Person other than the Company;

     (b) the breach of any  representation  or warranty  made by the  Originator
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or
any information or report delivered by the Originator pursuant hereto or thereto
(including any information contained in a Purchase Report) which shall have been
false or incorrect in any material respect when made, deemed made or delivered;

     (c) the failure by the Originator to comply with any  applicable  law, rule
or regulation  with respect to any  Receivable or the related  Contract,  or the
nonconformity of any Receivable or the related Contract with any such applicable
law, rule or regulation;

     (d) the  failure to vest and  maintain  vested in the  Company a  perfected
ownership  interest in the  Receivables  generated by the Originator and Related
Rights free and clear of any Adverse Claim,  other than an Adverse Claim arising
solely as a result of an act of the Company, whether existing at the time of the
purchase or

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

 contribution of such Receivables or at any time thereafter;

     (e) the failure of the  Originator  to file with respect to itself,  or any
delay by the  Originator  in  filing,  financing  statements  or  other  similar
instruments or documents  under the UCC of any applicable  jurisdiction or other
applicable  laws  with  respect  to any  Receivables  or  purported  Receivables
generated  by the  Originator  or  Related  Rights,  whether  at the time of any
purchase or contribution or at any subsequent time;

     (f) any  dispute,  claim,  offset  or  defense  (other  than  discharge  in
bankruptcy)  of the  Obligor  to the  payment  of any  Receivable  or  purported
Receivable generated by the Originator (including, without limitation, a defense
based on such Receivables or the related Contracts not being a legal,  valid and
binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms), or any other claim resulting from or relating to the transaction  giving
rise to any Receivable or relating to collection  activities with respect to any
Receivable (if such  collection  activities  were performed by the Originator or
any of  its  Affiliates  acting  as  Servicer  or by any  agent  or  independent
contractor retained by the Originator or any of its Affiliates);

     (g) any products  liability or other claim,  investigation,  litigation  or
proceeding  arising out of or in  connection  with goods,  insurance or services
that secure or relate to any Receivable;

     (h) any litigation,  proceeding or investigation  against the Originator or
in respect of any Receivable or Related Right;

     (i) any tax or  governmental  fee or charge  (other  than any tax  excluded
pursuant to the proviso  below),  all  interest  and  penalties  thereon or with
respect  thereto,  and all  out-of-pocket  costs  and  expenses,  including  the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in defending against the same, which may
arise by reason of the purchase, contribution or ownership of the Receivables or
any Related Right connected with any such Receivables;

     (j) any failure of the Originator,  individually or as Servicer, to perform
its duties or obligations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document; and

     (k) the commingling of any Collections at any time with other funds;

excluding,  however,  (i)  Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Amounts to the extent
resulting from gross negligence or willful  misconduct on the part of a Purchase
and Sale Indemnified  Party,  (ii) any

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

indemnification  which  has  the  effect  of  recourse  for  non-payment  of the
Receivables  due to  credit  reasons  to the  Originator  (except  as  otherwise
specifically  provided  under this  Section 9.1) and (iii) any tax based upon or
measured by net income or gross receipts.

     If for any reason the indemnification provided above in this Section 9.1 is
unavailable to a Purchase and Sale Indemnified  Party or is insufficient to hold
such Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party harmless,  then the Originator  shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such  Purchase and Sale  Indemnified
Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability to the maximum extent
permitted under  applicable  law.  Promptly after receipt by a Purchase and Sale
Indemnified  Party  under  this  Article  IX of  notice  of  any  claim  or  the
commencement  of any action  arising out of or as a result of any of  paragraphs
(a) through (j) above, the Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party shall, if a claim
in respect  thereof is to be made against the Originator  under this Article IX,
notify  the  Originator  in  writing  of the claim or the  commencement  of that
action;  provided,  however, that the failure to notify the Originator shall not
relieve it from any liability  which it may have under this Article IX except to
the extent it has been  materially  prejudiced  by such failure  and,  provided,
further, that the failure to notify the Originator shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to a Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party otherwise
than under this Article IX. If any such claim or action shall be brought against
a Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party,  the  Originator  shall be entitled to
participate  therein  and, to the extent  that it wishes,  to assume the defense
thereof with counsel  satisfactory to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party.
After notice from the Originator to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party of
its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Originator shall
not be liable to the Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party under this Article IX
for any legal or other  expenses  subsequently  incurred  by  Purchase  and Sale
Indemnified  Party in connection  with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of  investigation.  The Originator shall not (i) without the prior written
consent of the relevant  Purchase and Sale  Indemnified  Party or Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  settle or compromise or consent to
the entry of any  judgment  with  respect to any  pending or  threatened  claim,
action,  suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution
may be sought hereunder  (whether or not the Purchase and Sale Indemnified Party
or Parties are actual or potential  parties to such claim or action) unless such
settlement,  compromise  or consent  includes an  unconditional  release of each
Purchase  and Sale  Indemnified  Party from all  liability  arising  out of such
claim,  action,  suit or proceeding or (ii) be liable for any  settlement of any
such action  affected  without its written  consent  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a
final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the Originator agrees

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

to  indemnify  and hold  harmless  any  indemnified  party from and  against any
Purchase and Sale Indemnified Amounts relating thereto.

     (b)  No  failure  or  delay  on the  part  of the  Company,  Servicer,  the

exercise  of any such  power or right  preclude  any other or  further  exercise
thereof or the  exercise of any other power or right.  No notice to or demand on

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

   Minnesota  Power has  operations  in four  business  segments:  (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
services,  which include water and wastewater services; (3) automotive services,
which include auctions, a finance company and an auto transport company; and (4)
investments,  which include a securities portfolio, a 21% equity investment in a
financial guaranty reinsurance company and real estate operations.
   Earnings  Per Share.  Earnings  per share of common  stock were $2.28 in 1996
compared to $2.16 in 1995 and $2.06 in 1994. An increase in the number of shares
of common stock  outstanding in 1996 diluted 1996 earnings by 7 cents per share.
The dilution  reduced  electric  operations  earnings  per share 4 cents,  water
services 1 cent and investments 4 cents,  and increased by 2 cents per share the
negative impact on earnings attributable to corporate charges.  Return on common
equity was 11.3%, 10.7% and 10.5% for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

   Electric operations earnings per share in 1996 were down slightly due to a 3%
decrease in sales to the Company's large power customers and the dilutive effect
of the increase in common stock  outstanding.  The decrease was partially offset
by sales to other customers.  The performance of water services in 1996 improved
over 1995  primarily  as a result of rate  relief and ongoing  cost  controls at
Florida Water.  1996 earnings from automotive  services reflect twelve months of
results while only six months are included in 1995 earnings.  1996 earnings also
reflect  growth in AFC's  floorplan  financing  business  and an increase in the
number of automobiles auctioned by ADESA. 1996 earnings from automotive services
were  tempered in part by start-up  losses at two new  auction  facilities.  The
contribution  of the  Company's  investments  was lower in 1996  because (i) the
average securities  portfolio balance was smaller in 1996 since a portion of the
portfolio  was  sold in 1995 to fund the  purchase  of  ADESA  and  (ii)  Lehigh
recognized  22 cents per share  compared to 52 cents of tax benefits in 1996 and
1995,  respectively.  Corporate  charges  in 1995  included a 14 cents per share
write-off of the Company's investment in Reach All.
   Electric operations contributed the same amount to earnings per share in 1995
compared to 1994. This reflected lower demand charges from large power customers
which were offset by increased  sales. The performance of water services in 1995
compared  to 1994  reflected  lower  water  sales in Florida in 1995 due to high
rainfall  during the year. The 1994  performance of water services was favorably
impacted  by a 42 cent per  share  gain  from the sale of  certain  water  plant
assets.  Real estate  operations  in 1994  reflected 13 cents per share from the
recognition  of escrow funds.  Portfolio and  reinsurance  in 1994 included a 21
cent per share write-off of a securities  investment.  Corporate charges in 1994
included an 11 cent per share loss from the Company's investment in Reach All.
   Discontinued  operations  included  results from the paper and pulp  business
which was sold in June 1995. The increase in income from discontinued operations
reflected higher paper and pulp prices in 1995.

Consolidated Financial Review

   Operating Revenue and Income.  Electric operations revenue was higher in 1996
compared to 1995 due to a 14%  increase in total kWh sales,  setting a new sales
record  for the  second  year in a row.  The  increase  in sales  is  attributed
primarily to MPEX,  the  Company's  new  wholesale  marketing  division  that is
selling  energy,  capacity  and  brokering  services to other  power  suppliers.
Extreme  winter  weather in 1996 compared to the milder winter in 1995 increased
sales to  residential  and  commercial  customers  and reduced sales to taconite
producers.
   Revenue  in 1995 was  higher  than 1994  because  of  increased  kWh sales to
industrial  customers,  higher  commercial  and  residential  rates,  and  a 37%
increase in kWh sales for resale.  One major taconite  electric  customer of the
Company operated all year in 1995 and only four months in 1994.
   Water services  revenue and income was higher in 1996 compared to 1995 due to
higher rates, a 9% increase in consumption,  gains from the sale of assets,  and
the  inclusion  of $5.3  million of revenue from ISI.  Florida  Water,  formerly
Southern States Utilities,  Inc., implemented an interim rate increase effective
Jan. 23,  1996,  and final rates  effective  Sept.  20, 1996,  in total an $11.1
million  annual  increase.  Florida Water added 17,000 new water and  wastewater
customers  as a result of the  December  1995  purchase  of the assets of Orange
Osceola in Florida.  A 2% growth in customers and normal  consumption due to the
return of more typical  weather in Florida both  contributed  to higher sales in
1996.  Heater,  which owns

and  operates  the  Company's  water  operations  in North  Carolina  and  South
Carolina,  made a strategic  decision to withdraw from South Carolina,  sold the
majority  of its assets in that  state and  recognized  $1.7  million in pre-tax
gains  during  1996.  In April 1996 the Company  purchased  ISI, a company  that
specializes in predictive maintenance of water supply equipment.
   Operating  revenue in 1995 was lower than 1994 due to 15,000 fewer  customers
following the December 1994 sale of the Venice Gardens'  assets in Florida.  The
sale resulted in a $19.1 million gain in 1994. High rainfall in parts of Florida
and customer water  conservation  efforts also lowered operating revenue in 1995
and 1994.
   Automotive  services  operating  revenue and income is included as of July 1,
1995,  the  purchase  date of ADESA.  In  addition  to  including a full year of
operations,  operating revenue and income was higher in 1996 because ADESA added
eight new auction  sites during the year and sold more than 600,000 cars in 1996
compared  to 230,000  cars during the last six months of 1995  (470,000  cars in
total were sold by ADESA in 1995).  Ancillary  services,  such as transportation
and reconditioning, and the expansion of AFC also contributed to revenue growth.
   Investments  revenue  and  income was  higher in 1996 due to  increased  real
estate sales in Florida.  Lehigh  purchased  properties at Palm Coast in Florida
and expanded its  marketing  program  nationwide.  Also  included in  investment
income is the contribution of the securities portfolio. Due to a smaller average
portfolio  balance  resulting  from the sale of  approximately  $60  million  of
securities to finance the ADESA purchase, the contribution was lower.
   Investments  revenue and income in 1996 reflected an after-tax return of 8.8%
compared to 9.2% in 1995 and 3.8% in 1994. The 1994 after-tax  return included a
$10.1 million write-off of a securities investment. Operating revenue and income
from real  estate  operations  was lower in 1995  compared  to 1994 due to fewer
commercial land sales and Lehigh's maturing accounts  receivable  portfolio.  In
1994 Lehigh recognized in revenue $4.5 million of escrow funds.
   Operating  Expenses.  Fuel and purchased  power  expenses were higher in 1996
than 1995 because of a 14%  increase in kWh sold.  Sales for resale were up over
48% due to the marketing  efforts  initiated by MPEX in 1996.  These expenses in
1995 were higher than 1994 because of a 13% increase in kWh sold.
   Operations  expenses  were higher in 1996  reflecting  $91 million for a full
year of automotive  services'  operations compared to $31 million for six months
in 1995.  ADESA  added  eight  auctions  which  contributed  to the  increase in
operations  expense in 1996.  Expenses  in 1995 were higher than 1994 due to the
inclusion of automotive  services,  scheduled  electric  maintenance  costs, and
increased  expenses  related  to  conservation  improvement  programs  (CIP) and
customer services.
   Administrative  and  general  expenses  were  higher in 1996  reflecting  $73
million  for a full  year of  automotive  services  operations  compared  to $27
million for six months in 1995.  Medical  plan  expenses for  employees  and the
amortization  of  an  early  retirement  program  offered  to  electric  utility
employees in 1995 also increased expenses in 1996.  Expenses in 1995 were higher
than 1994 due to the  addition of  automotive  services'  expenses  totaling $27
million  and salary  and  benefit  increases  company-wide.  Salary and  benefit
increases  were  tempered  by lower  payroll  costs  associated  with the  early
retirement program.
   Interest  expense was higher in 1996 due primarily to a $30 million  increase
in outstanding  long-term  indebtedness related to the addition and expansion of
automotive services.  In addition,  the average short-term  indebtedness balance
was higher by $60 million in 1996.
   Income  from  equity  investments  of  $11.8  million  in 1996  was  from the
Company's 21% ownership interest in Capital Re compared to $9.8 and $8.1 million
in 1995 and 1994. Income from equity  investments in 1995 and 1994 also included
losses from Reach All of $6.4 and $5.2  million,  respectively,  a business  the
Company exited in 1995.
   Income tax  expense in 1996 and 1995  included  the  recognition  of $8.2 and
$18.4  million,  respectively,  of tax  benefits  associated  with  real  estate
operations in Florida.  Excluding these tax benefits,  the effective tax rate in
1996 and 1995 was 31% compared to 26% in 1994.

Electric Operations

   Electric operations generate,  transmit,  distribute, and market electricity.
Minnesota  Power  provides  electricity  to 121,000  customers  in  northeastern
Minnesota,  while the Company's wholly owned subsidiary,  Superior Water,  Light
and Power  Company,  sells  electricity  to 14,000  customers and natural gas to
11,000 customers,  and provides water to 10,000  customers,  all in northwestern
Wisconsin.  Another  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  BNI Coal,  owns and  operates a
lignite  coal  mine in  North  Dakota.  Two  electric  generating  cooperatives,
Minnkota Power Cooperative,  Inc. and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI
Coal's production of lignite coal under contracts  extending to 2027.

   Electric Sales.  Kilowatthour  sales in 1996 of 13.2 billion  exceeded 1995's
record-setting  level of 11.5 billion kWh. Minnesota Power formally  established
MPEX as a new  division in early 1996.  MPEX is an  expansion  of the  Company's
inter-utility  marketing group which has been a buyer and seller of capacity and
energy for 25 years in the  wholesale  power  market.  The customers of MPEX are
other power  suppliers  in the Midwest and  Canada.  MPEX  contracts  to provide
hourly energy scheduling and power trading services.  MPEX is credited with most
of the increase in kWh sales.
   The two major industries in Minnesota  Power's service territory are taconite
production, and paper and wood products manufacturing. Taconite mining customers
accounted for 32% of electric  operating revenue in 1996, 35% in 1995 and 34% in
1994.  The paper and wood  products  industries  accounted  for 11% of  electric
operating  revenue  in  1996,  12% in 1995  and 13% in 1994.  Sales  for  resale
accounted for 13% of electric  operating  revenue in 1996 compared to 9% in 1995
and 8% in 1994.
   Taconite is an important raw material for the steel industry and is made from
low iron content ore mined in northern Minnesota. Taconite processing plants use
large  quantities of electric  power to grind the ore and  concentrate  the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 46
million tons in 1996 compared to 47 million in 1995 and 43 million tons in 1994.
Minnesota's  taconite  production  in 1997 is  expected to be  approximately  47
million  tons.  During 1996 and early 1997 the Company  successfully  negotiated
extended contracts with several customers including two of the Company's largest
customers, USX and Inland Steel.
   While  taconite  production  is expected to continue at annual levels over 40
million tons,  the long-term  future of this cyclical  industry is less certain.
Production may decline gradually some time after the year 2005.
   Large Power  Customer  Contracts.  Electric  service  contracts with 11 large
power  industrial  customers  require  payment of minimum monthly demand charges
that cover fixed costs associated with having capacity  available to serve them,
including  a  return  on  common  equity.  The  demand  charge  is paid by these
customers even if no electrical  energy is taken.  An energy charge is also paid
to cover the variable  cost of energy  actually  used. A four-year  cancellation
notice is required  to  terminate  the  contracts.  The rates and  corresponding
revenue  associated  with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are
subject to change through the regulatory  process  governing all retail electric
rates.

Summary of Minimum Revenue and Demand Under Contract as of February 1, 1997

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Company believes revenue from large power customers will be substantially
in excess of the minimum contract amounts.

   The 11 large  power  customers  each  require 10 MW or more of power and have
contract  termination  dates ranging from October 1999 to December 2007. Five of
these  customers  are  taconite  producers,  four are  paper  and wood  products
manufacturers and two are pipeline companies.  In addition to the minimum demand
provisions,  the contracts  with the taconite  producers and pipeline  companies
require these customers to purchase their entire electric  service  requirements
from the Company.  Six of the large power customers purchase a combined total of
200 MW of interruptible service pursuant to contract amendments incorporating an
interruptible  rate  schedule.   Under  this  schedule  and  pursuant  to  these
amendments,  the Company has the right to serve 100 MW of these customers' needs
through Oct.  31, 2008,  and another 100 MW of these  customers'  needs  through
April  30,  2010.  The  Company  has the  right  of  first  refusal  to serve an
additional 200 MW during these same time periods.
   Fuel. The cost of coal is the Company's  largest single operating  expense in
generating electricity. Coal consumption at the Company's generating stations in
1996 was 4.3  million  tons.  Minnesota  Power  currently  has three coal supply
agreements in place with Montana  suppliers.  Two terminate in December 1999 and
the other in December 2000.  Under these  agreements the Company has the tonnage
flexibility to procure between 55% and 100% of its total coal requirements.  The
Company uses this flexibility to purchase coal under spot-market agreements when
favorable  market  conditions  exist.  The Company  continues to explore  future
supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous
coal will continue to be available.  The Company has contracts  with  Burlington
Northern  Railroad to deliver  coal from  Montana  and Wyoming to the  Company's
generating facilities in Minnesota through December 2003.
   Purchased  Power  Contract.  Under an agreement  extending  through 2007 with
Square  Butte,  Minnesota  Power  purchases  71% (about 320 MW during the summer
months  and 333 MW during  the  winter  months)  of the  output of a  mine-mouth
generating unit located near 

15

<PAGE>
Center, North Dakota. The Square Butte unit is one of two lignite-fired units at
Minnkota Power Cooperative's Milton R. Young Generating Station.
   Square Butte has the option,  upon five years advance  notice,  to reduce the
Company's  share of the unit's  output to 49%.  Minnesota  Power has the option,
though  not the  obligation,  to  continue  to  purchase  49% of the  output  at
market-based  prices  after  2007  to  the  end of the  plant's  economic  life.
Minnesota  Power must pay any Square Butte costs and expenses that have not been
paid by Square Butte when due, regardless of whether or not the Company receives
any power from that unit.
   Early  Retirement  Plan and  Workforce  Reduction.  In late 1996 the  Company
reduced its workforce in electric  operations by 4%. In 1995 an early retirement
offer to electric utility employees  resulted in a 12% reduction of the electric
operations  workforce,  at a cost of  approximately  $15 million  which is being
amortized  over 3 years.  The  workforce  reductions  are part of the  Company's
ongoing efforts to control costs and maintain low electric rates.
   Competition.  The electric utility industry is changing at both the wholesale
and retail levels. The enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 resulted in an
increase in the  competitive  forces that affect three of the four components of
the electric utility industry: generation, transmission and power marketing. The
fourth  component,  local  distribution,  is subject to state  regulation.  This
legislation has resulted in a more competitive market for electricity  generally
and particularly in wholesale markets. Wholesale deregulation is underway, while
retail  deregulation of the industry is being considered at both the Federal and
state  level,  and is  affecting  the way the  Company  strategically  views the
future.  With  electric  rates  among the  lowest  in the US and with  long-term
wholesale and large power retail contracts in place, Minnesota Power believes it
is well positioned to address competitive pressures.
   Wholesale.  During  1996   the Company  completed  functional  unbundling  of
operations   under  the  requirements  of  FERC's  Order  No.  888  Open  Access
Transmission Rules. Order No. 888 requires public utilities to take transmission
service for their own wholesale transactions under the same terms and conditions
on which  transmission  service is  provided to third  parties.  The Company has
filed its open access  transmission tariff with the FERC, and expects to receive
final FERC rate approval  early in 1997. The Company has also filed its "Code of
Conduct" under FERC's Order No. 889 Open Access Same Time Information System and
Standards of Conduct to formalize the functional  separation of generation  from
transmission within the organization. As a result, the transmission component of
Minnesota Power's electric utility business is well organized for, and has begun
to operate under, these new federal regulatory requirements.
   Minnesota  Power's  newly formed MPEX division  currently  conducts the power
marketing  function.  FERC  approval  of  Minnesota  Power's  market-based  rate
authority  enabled  MPEX to  conduct a  successful  wholesale  power and  energy
marketing business in 1996. During 1996, MPEX also completed  compliance filings
under FERC's Open Access Transmission Rules to separately state the transmission
component of the Company's coordination sales agreements,  and is awaiting final
FERC  approvals.  MPEX continues to review new strategic  opportunities  for its
wholesale  marketing  operations  in light of the new Open  Access  Transmission
Rules  enacted  by FERC and of the new  power  and  energy  markets  within  the
Mid-Continent Area Power Pool.
   Retail.  In 1995 the MPUC  initiated an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  in the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery  of  electric   service   continues  to  be  efficient   following  any
restructuring,  the MPUC adopted 15 principles to guide a deliberate and orderly
approach to developing  reasonable  restructuring  alternatives  that ensure the
fairness of a  competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January
1996  the  MPUC  established  a  competition  working  group  in  which  company
representatives  have participated in addressing issues related to wholesale and
retail  competition.  Minnesota Power has  implemented a key account  management
process and anticipates  continuing  negotiations  with its large industrial and
commercial customers to explore contractual options to lower energy costs. These
customers  continue  to  aggressively  seek  lower  energy  costs  and  consider
alternative suppliers in anticipation of deregulated retail markets.
   Legislation.  In 1997 Congress and the Minnesota  legislature are expected to
continue  to debate  proposed  legislation  which,  if  enacted,  would  promote
customer choice and a more competitive  electric market. The Company is actively
participating  in the  dialogue  and debate on these  issues in various  forums,
principally to advocate fairness and parity for all power and energy competitors
in any  deregulated  markets  that may be  created by any new  legislation.  The
Company  cannot predict the timing or substance of any  legislation  which might
ultimately be enacted.  However,  the Company continues taking steps to maintain
its  competitive  position as a low-cost  supplier and  maintain  its  long-term
contracts  with large  industrial  customers.  The  Company  is also  advocating
property tax reform before the Minnesota  legislature  in order to eliminate the
taxation of personal  property that results in an inequitable  tax burden among
current  and  potential  competitors  in  local  markets. Finally, SWL&P is
participating in the electric restructuring 


                                                                              16
                                                                              --

investigation before the PSCW,  which is advising the  Wisconsin  legislature on
recommended restructuring in Wisconsin.
   Conservation.  Minnesota  requires  electric  utilities to spend a minimum of
1.5% of annual retail  electric  revenue on  conservation  improvement  programs
(CIP) each year. An annually  approved billing  adjustment  combined with retail
base rates allow the Company to recover both costs of energy-saving programs and
"lost margins" associated with power saved as a result of such programs.
   The  Company's  largest  conservation  programs  are targeted at taconite and
paper  customers to promote  their  efficient  use of energy.  CIP also provides
demand-side  management  grants on a competitive  basis to commercial  and small
industrial  customers,  low-cost  financing for energy-saving  investments,  and
promotes energy conservation for all residential and commercial customers. SWL&P
also offers  electric and gas  conservation  programs to qualified  customers as
approved by the PSCW.
   Clean Air Act. While many utilities and their  customers will face high costs
to comply  with  clean-air  legislation,  the  Company  expects  to meet  future
requirements  without  major  spending.  By  burning  low-sulfur  fuels in units
equipped with pollution  control  equipment,  the Company's power plants already
operate at or near the sulfur dioxide  emission  limits set for the year 2000 by
the Federal Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990.  To meet  nitrogen  oxide  emission
limits for 2000, the Company expects to install new burner  technology and other
associated equipment at a cost of $6 million.
   1996 to 1995  Comparison.  Operating  revenue from  electric  operations  was
higher in 1996  compared to 1995 due to a 14%  increase in total kWh sales.  The
increase in sales is attributed  primarily to the Company's  marketing of energy
to other power  suppliers as well as extreme  winter weather in 1996 compared to
the milder winter in 1995. Revenue from sales of electricity was up in 1996, but
provided  lower  margins due to the cooler summer  weather in 1996  resulting in
more competitive  wholesale pricing.  Square Butte, one of Minnesota Power's low
priced sources of energy, produced 23% more energy in 1996, after being down for
scheduled  maintenance  in 1995.  Costs  associated  with the  early  retirement
offering in mid-1995  are being  amortized  over three  years.  Expenses in 1996
included  twelve months of  amortization,  while 1995 included only five months.
Employee and customer related expenses were higher in 1996. The Company measures
the profitability of its operations  through careful budgeting and monitoring of
contributions by segment to corporate  earnings per share.  Electric  operations
contributed  $1.32 to earnings  per share in 1996  compared to $1.36 in 1995 and
1994.  The per share amount in 1996 was  slightly  lower due to a 3% decrease in
sales to the Company's  large power  customers and the 4 cent dilutive effect of
the increase in common stock outstanding.   The decrease was partially offset by
sales to other customers.  The contribution from electric operations is expected
to remain stable in the future as the industry continues to deregulate. Electric
operations  will  continue  to seek  additional  cost  saving  alternatives  and
efficiencies  and expand  unregulated  services to maintain its  contribution to
earnings.
   1995 to 1994  Comparison.  Like 1996, 1995 was an excellent year for electric
operations.  The Company set records for electric sales, revenue and generation.
Operating revenue from electric  operations was higher in 1995 compared to 1994,
due to a 13% increase in total kWh sales, increased retail rates  and collection
of CIP  expenditures.  Warm  summer  weather  and  increased  demand  from large
industrial  customers and other power  suppliers  significantly  increased sales
over 1994.

Water Services

   Water  services  include  Florida  Water,  Heater and ISI, three wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company.  Florida Water provides water to 120,000  customers
and  wastewater  treatment  services  to 54,000  customers  in  Florida.  Heater
provides water to 22,000  customers and wastewater  treatment  services to 1,000
customers  in  North  Carolina  and  South  Carolina.  ISI  provides  predictive
maintenance services to water utility companies and other industrial  operations
in North Carolina, South Carolina,  Florida,  Georgia,  Tennessee,  Virginia and
Texas. ISI was acquired in 1996.
   Water and Wastewater Rates. 1995 Rate Case.  Florida Water requested an $18.1
million rate increase in June 1995. On Oct. 30, 1996,  the FPSC issued its final
order in the  Florida  Water rate case.  The final order  established  water and
wastewater  rates for all customers of Florida Water  regulated by the FPSC. The
new rates,  which became effective on Sept. 20, 1996,  resulted in an annualized
increase in revenue of approximately $11.1 million. This increase included,  and
was not in addition to, the $7.9 million increase in annualized  revenue granted
as interim  rates  effective  on Jan.  23,  1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate
structure  called  "capband,"  which replaces  uniform rates.  The new structure
combines the concept of a "cap" on monthly bills at a certain usage level for 85
of  Florida  Water's  facilities  that are more  expensive  to  operate,  with a
"banding,"  or  grouping,  of  rates  paid by  customers  served  by the 56 less
expensive  facilities.  On Nov.  1, 1996,  Florida  Water filed with the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  (Court) an appeal of the FPSC's  final  order
seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in
utility

17

<PAGE>
facilities   recoverable   in  rates  from   current   customers.   Motions  for
reconsideration  of the  FPSC's  final  order were  subsequently  filed by other
parties to the rate case.  Therefore,  the Court has postponed  Florida  Water's
appeal  pending the FPSC's  disposition  of the  reconsideration  requests.  The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this  matter.  Florida law  provides
that the new rates be implemented while the order is under appeal.
   1991 Rate Case Refund Order.  Responding to a Florida  Supreme Court decision
addressing the issue of retroactive  ratemaking with respect to another company,
in March 1996 the FPSC voted to reconsider an October 1995 order (Refund  Order)
which would have  required  Florida  Water to refund  about $13  million,  which
includes  interest,  to customers who paid more since October 1993 under uniform
rates than they would have paid under stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order,
the  collection  of the $13 million from  customers  who paid less under uniform
rates would not be  permitted.  The Refund  Order was in response to the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  reversal in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order
which  imposed  uniform  rates  for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in
Florida.  With "uniform  rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the
same rates for water and wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative
to "stand-alone" rates which are based on the cost of serving each service area.
The FPSC reconsidered the Refund Order, but upheld its decision to order refunds
in August 1996.  Florida  Water filed an appeal of this  decision with the First
District  Court of  Appeals.  A decision on the appeal is  anticipated  by early
1998. The Company continues to believe that it would be improper for the FPSC to
order a refund  to one  group of  customers  without  permitting  recovery  of a
similar  amount from the remaining  customers  since the First District Court of
Appeals  affirmed the Company's  total  revenue  requirement  for  operations in
Florida.  No provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.
   Florida Jurisdictional Issues. In June 1995 the FPSC issued an order assuming
jurisdiction over Florida Water facilities  statewide following an investigation
of all of Florida Water's facilities.  Several counties in Florida appealed this
FPSC decision to the First District Court of Appeals. In December 1996 the Court
issued an opinion  reversing  the FPSC order.  In December 1996 the FPSC filed a
motion for clarification and for rehearing with the Court. The Court denied this
motion in January 1997. The FPSC voted to require  Florida Water to charge rates
to customers in Hernando County based on a modified  stand-alone  rate structure
in January 1997.  The  imposition of this rate  structure  would reduce  Florida
Water  revenue by $1.6 million on a prospective  annual basis.  No order has yet
been issued reflecting this vote. Florida Water is considering an appeal of such
an order. In the event county regulation of water and wastewater rates prevails,
the Company  anticipates that the regulatory  process will become  significantly
more complex and expensive.
   Competition. Water services provide water and wastewater utility services at 
regulated rates within exclusive service territories granted by regulators.
   1996 and 1995  Comparison.  Operating  revenue and income from water services
increased 29% in 1996  compared to 1995.  Rate relief and a 9% increase in sales
in 1996 are  primarily  responsible  for the  increase.  The  addition of 17,000
customers  following  the December 1995  purchase of Orange  Osceola  offset the
15,000  customer  decrease  from the sale of Venice  Gardens in 1994.  Workforce
reductions and ongoing cost controls  contributed to 1996 results.  The addition
of ISI operations in 1996 increased revenue and expense about 6%.  Approximately
$1.7  million in pre-tax  gains  were added to 1996  results  due to the sale of
assets in South Carolina.
   Water services  contributed 18 cents per share to earnings in 1996,  compared
to a 4 cent loss in 1995. The Company  anticipates  continued growth in earnings
from this segment as Heater  aggressively  pursues  opportunities  to expand its
business  in North  Carolina,  additional  competitive  operations  are added to
complement ISI and cost controls combined with efficiency gains are continued in
ongoing operations. The outcome of Florida's rate case and jurisdictional issues
have the potential for affecting the profitability of this segment.
   1995 and 1994  Comparison.  Operating  revenue and income from water services
fell 24% in 1995  compared to 1994.  The decrease is  attributed to 15,000 fewer
customers  following  the sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets in December  1994 and
lower water  consumption  due to high  rainfall in parts of Florida and customer
conservation  efforts.  The sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets  contributed  $19.1
million to water services' operating revenue in 1994.

Automotive Services

   Automotive  services  include  ADESA's  auction  facilities,  AFC, which is a
finance  company,  and an  auto  transport  company.  ADESA  is a  wholly  owned
subsidiary of the Company and is the third largest  automobile  auction business
in the US.  Headquartered in Indianapolis,  Indiana,  ADESA owns and operates 24
automobile  auctions  in the US and  Canada  through  which  used cars and other
vehicles  are  sold to  franchised  automobile  dealers  and  licensed  used car
dealers.   Sellers  at  ADESA's  auctions  include  domestic  and  foreign  auto
manufacturers,  car dealers, fleet/lease companies, banks and finance companies.
AFC provides inventory financing for wholesale and retail automobile dealers who
purchase vehicles from independent auctions as well as auction chains.

   The Company  acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995.  On Jan.  31,  1996,  the
Company provided  additional  capital in exchange for an additional 3% of ADESA.
On Aug. 21, 1996, the Company  acquired the remaining 17% ownership  interest of
ADESA from the ADESA management shareholders.
   During  1996  ADESA  opened  new  auto   auctions  in  Newark,   New  Jersey,
Jacksonville,  Florida and Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. During 1996 in Texas,
the third largest used car market in the US, ADESA acquired  auction  businesses
in Houston, San Antonio and Dallas, which together with its existing Austin site
are intended to firmly establish  ADESA's  presence in the Texas market.  During
1996  ADESA  also  acquired  auction   businesses  in  Portage,   Wisconsin  and
Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania.  In February 1997 ADESA  consolidated a small auction
facility in Concord, Massachusetts with its Boston facilities.
   AFC's floorplan  financing  operations have expanded in 1996. Located at most
ADESA  auction  locations,  AFC has  opened  loan  production  offices  at seven
independently owned  auto  auctions.  AFC expects to continue this  expansion in
1997.
   Competition.  Within the automobile  auction  industry,  ADESA's  competition
includes  independently  owned auctions as well as major chains and associations
with  auctions  within  its  geographic  proximity.  ADESA  competes  with other
auctions for dealers,  financial  institutions,  fleet and lease companies,  and
other sellers to provide  automobiles  for auction at consignment  sales and for
the supply of rental repurchase  vehicles from the automobile  manufacturers for
auction at factory  sales.  The  automobile  manufacturers  often choose between
auctions across  multi-state areas in distributing  rental repurchase  vehicles.
ADESA  competes  for sellers of  automobiles  by  attempting  to attract a large
number of dealers to purchase  vehicles,  which ensures  competitive  prices and
supports  the volume of  vehicles  auctioned,  and by  providing a full range of
services  including   reconditioning  services  which  prepare  automobiles  for
auction,  transporting  automobiles  to auction  and the prompt  handling of the
paperwork  necessary  to  complete  the  sales.  Another  factor  affecting  the
industry,  the impact of which is yet to be  determined,  is the entrance of the
"superstore", large used car dealerships, that have emerged in densely populated
markets.
   AFC is well positioned as a provider of floorplan  financing  services to the
used vehicle industry.  AFC's competition  includes other specialty lenders,  as
well as  banks  and  other  financial  institutions.  AFC  competes  with  other
floorplan  providers and strives to  distinguish  itself based upon ease of use,
quality  of service  and  price.  A key  component  of AFC's  program is on-site
personnel to assist automobile dealers with their financing needs.
   Auto auction  sales for the industry are predicted to rise at a rate of 6% to
8% annually.  With the increased  popularity of leasing and the high cost of new
cars,  the same cars may come to  auction  more than once.  Automotive  services
expect to participate in the industry's  growth through  selective  acquisitions
and expanded services.
   1996 and 1995 Comparison.  Automotive services contributed 13 cents per share
to  corporate  earnings in 1996  compared to a  breakeven  performance  in 1995.
Severe winter  weather on the east coast limited  auction sales in January 1996.
However, operating revenue was strong in 1996 as a result of the eight new sites
and increased ancillary services.  AFC expanded its dealer financing business in
1996 increasing  financing income and earnings.  Start-up losses associated with
the new sites in New Jersey and Florida had a negative  impact on  profitability
of this segment through 1996. For the six months ended Dec. 31, 1995,  operating
revenue was $61.6 million with no net income contribution.  Financial results in
1995 were  adversely  impacted by auction  cancellations  due to severe  weather
conditions  on the east  coast in  December  1995,  as well as  start-up  losses
associated with major construction projects.  Growth in AFC's financing business
and  growth  in the  number  of cars  being  auctioned  combined  with  improved
efficiencies and significant cost controls at existing  auctions are expected to
increase the contributions to earnings in 1997.  Financial results for ADESA for
periods  prior  to July 1,  1995,  are not  comparable  due to  several  factors
including the amortization of goodwill,  the severe weather in December 1995 and
January 1996, and the addition of eight auction facilities which caused ADESA to
incur additional financing expenses and significant start-up costs.

Investments

   Investments  include a portfolio of  securities  managed by  Minnesota  Power
which  provides  earnings  and cash  flow  contributions  and is  available  for
reinvestment in existing businesses and acquisitions. Investments also include a
21% equity investment in Capital Re, a financial guaranty  reinsurance  company,
and an 80% interest in Lehigh, a Florida real estate company.
   Portfolio and Reinsurance. As of Dec. 31, 1996, the Company had approximately
$155 million invested in a securities  portfolio.  The majority of the portfolio
consists of stocks of other utility  companies that have  investment  grade debt
securities  outstanding  and are  considered  by the Company to be  conservative
investments.  Additionally,  

19

<PAGE>

the Company sells common stock  securities  short and enters into short sales of
treasury  futures  contracts as part of an overall  investment  portfolio  hedge
strategy.  The  Company  plans to  continue  to  concentrate  in market  neutral
strategies  that are designed to provide stable and acceptable  returns  without
sacrificing  needed liquidity.  Returns will continue to be partially  dependent
upon general market yields.
   Capital  Re is  the  parent  company  of a  group  of  specialty  reinsurance
companies. The Company's equity investment in Capital Re continues to be a major
contributor to earnings. In 1996 Capital Re contributed $7.8 million to earnings
compared to $8.2 million in 1995 and $7 million in 1994. The market value of the
Company's  $102  million  investment  in Capital Re was $152 million at Dec. 31,
1996.
   1996 and 1995 Comparison.  The Company's  securities portfolio performed well
in 1996.  The  securities  portfolio and investment in Capital Re contributed 80
cents to  earnings  per  share  compared  to 88 cents  in  1995.  Portfolio  and
reinsurance earned an after-tax return of 8.8% in 1996 and 9.2% in 1995.
   1995 and 1994 Comparison. In 1995 the performance of the securities portfolio
improved  significantly  over 1994.  Earnings per share from the  portfolio  and
reinsurance  were 88 cents per share compared to 47 cents in 1994. The write-off
of a $10.1 million securities investment lowered earnings in 1994. Portfolio and
reinsurance earned an after-tax return of 9.2% in 1995 and 3.8% in 1994.
   Real Estate Operations. The Company owns 80% of Lehigh, a real estate company
which owns various real estate  properties  in Florida.  Lehigh  currently  owns
4,000 acres of land and approximately 8,000 home sites near Fort Myers, Florida,
1,250  home  sites in Citrus  County,  Florida,  and 3,000 home sites and 13,000
acres of commercial land at Palm Coast,  Florida.  The Palm Coast properties and
$18 million  receivable  portfolio were purchased in April 1996. The real estate
strategy is to acquire large residential  community  properties at low cost, add
value, and sell them at going market prices.
   Tax Benefits.  The Company,  through  Lehigh,  a 67% owned  subsidiary at the
time,  acquired the stock of Lehigh  Corporation in a bargain  purchase in 1991.
Lehigh  then  began  execution  of a  business  strategy  pursuant  to which the
majority of the  acquired  real estate  assets  would be disposed of over a five
year period. An additional interest in Lehigh was purchased in 1993 bringing the
Company's ownership interest to 80%. The structure of the transactions  involved
the acquisition of stock so the tax bases of the underlying acquired assets were
carried over for income tax purposes.  The  carried-over  tax bases exceeded the
book bases  assigned in purchase  accounting.  The  Internal  Revenue Code (IRC)
limits the use of tax losses  resulting  from the higher tax basis over the fair
market  value of the  underlying  assets  for a period of five  years.  The 1993
increase in ownership by the Company to 80%,  which resulted in the inclusion of
Lehigh and Lehigh Corporation in the Company's  consolidated tax return, started
another five year limitation period.
   SFAS 109 was adopted on a  prospective  basis  effective  Jan. 1, 1993.  Upon
adoption,  a valuation  reserve was established for the entire amount of the tax
benefits  attributable  to the bases  differences  and  alternative  minimum tax
credits because, in management's  judgment,  realization of the tax benefits was
not "more  likely  than not." This  judgment  was based on the  unlikelihood  of
realizing the tax benefits due to the IRC restrictions, in light of management's
existing five year property  disposal  plan.  This situation  continued  through
1994.
   In 1995 Lehigh  implemented  a business  strategy  which called for Lehigh to
dispose  of its  remaining  real  estate  assets  with a specific  view  towards
maximizing  realization of the tax benefits.  The new strategy was adopted after
the Board of Directors of Lehigh,  including  the  minority  shareholders,  were
convinced of the cash flow benefit to Lehigh of deferring the liquidation of the
remaining real estate  assets.  Accordingly,  in 1995 the valuation  reserve was
reduced by $18.4  million based on a detailed  analysis of the projected  future
taxable income based on the new business strategy.
   In 1996 the remaining  $8.2 million  valuation  reserve was reversed based on
the  projected  positive  impact the  acquisition  of $34 million of real estate
assets at Palm  Coast  would have on  Lehigh's  taxable  income.  The Palm Coast
assets were not considered in the 1995 revised strategy.
   1996 and 1995 Comparison.  Revenue in 1996 includes  increased sales from the
Palm Coast  properties  and $3.7 million from the sale of Lehigh's joint venture
in a resort and golf course.  Lehigh also  recognized  $8.2 and $18.4 million of
tax benefits in 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  The Company's  portion of the tax
benefits  reflected as net income was $6.6 million in 1996 and $14.7  million in
1995.  Real  estate  operations  added 50 cents to  earnings  per  share in 1996
compared to 58 cents in 1995,  of which tax benefits  were 22 cents and 52 cents
in 1996 and 1995, respectively.
   1995 and 1994  Comparison.  Income from real estate  operations was higher in
1995  than  1994  primarily  due to the  recognition  of  $18.4  million  of tax
benefits.  This tax benefit was partially  offset by fewer commercial land sales
and less interest income from Lehigh's maturing accounts receivable portfolio.

                                                                              20
                                                                              --

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   As  detailed in the  consolidated  statement  of cash flows,  cash flows from
operating  activities  were  affected by a number of factors  representative  of
normal  operations.  Automotive  services are  included  since the July 1, 1995,
acquisition of ADESA.
   Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally is provided by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and approximately 5.4 million original issue shares of common stock
are available for issuance through the DRIP.  Minnesota Power's $77 million bank
lines of credit provide  liquidity for the Company's  commercial  paper program.
The amount and timing of future sales of the  Company's  securities  will depend
upon market  conditions and the specific  needs of the Company.  The Company may
from time to time sell securities to meet capital  requirements,  to provide for
the retirement or early  redemption of issues of long-term debt and/or preferred
stock, to reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.
   A substantial amount of ADESA's working capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA utilizes borrowings from the
Company to meet short-term working capital  requirements arising from the timing
of payment  obligations to vehicle  sellers and the  availability  of funds from
vehicle  purchasers.  During the sales  process,  ADESA does not typically  take
title to vehicles.
   AFC  also  offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for  dealers  to  purchase
automobiles   at  auctions  in  exchange  for  a  security   interest  in  those
automobiles.  The  financing  is  provided  through  the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the  automobile or a general  borrowing  term of 30 - 60 days. As a
result,  AFC also  uses  borrowings  from the  Company  to meet its  operational
requirements. During 1996 AFC increased the financing program for dealers and in
December sold a $50 million  participation in its finance receivables to a third
party  purchaser.  Under  the terms of the five year  agreement,  the  purchaser
agrees  to make  reinvestments  up to  $100  million  to the  extent  that  such
reinvestments  are  supported by eligible  receivables.  On Dec.  31, 1996,  AFC
received $50 million from the sale of receivables and used the proceeds to repay
borrowings from the Company.
   In January  1996  Florida  Water  issued  $35.1  million  of 6.5%  Industrial
Development  Refunding  Revenue Bonds Series 1996 due Oct. 1, 2025. The proceeds
were used to refund existing industrial development revenue bonds totaling $33.8
million.  Also in January 1996 the Company provided  additional capital to ADESA
in exchange for an additional 3% of ADESA.  In August 1996 the Company  acquired
the  remaining  17%  ownership  interest  of  ADESA  from the  ADESA  management
shareholders.  Funds from the issuance of commercial  paper were used to acquire
the remaining 17% of ADESA.
   MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned  business trust of
the Company for the purpose of issuing common and preferred securities. In March
1996 the Trust publicly issued three million 8.05%  Cumulative  Quarterly Income
Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred beneficial interests in the
assets held by the Trust, indirectly resulting in net proceeds to the Company of
$72.3 million. The net proceeds to the Company were used to retire approximately
$56 million of  commercial  paper and  approximately  $17  million  were used to
redeem all of the outstanding  shares of the Company's  Serial  Preferred Stock,
$7.36 Series, in May 1996.
   In May 1996 ADESA  issued $90 million of 7.70%  Senior  Notes,  Series A, Due
2006 in a Rule 144A  offering.  Proceeds  were  used by ADESA to repay  existing
indebtedness,   including   borrowings  under  ADESA's   revolving  bank  credit
agreement,  floating  rate option notes and certain  borrowings  from  Minnesota
Power.
   In June 1996 Lehigh obtained a $20 million  adjustable rate revolving line of
credit due in 2003. The proceeds were used to partially  finance the acquisition
of real estate near Palm Coast, Florida. In June 1996 the Company's registration
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  became effective with respect to 5
million  additional  shares of common  stock for offer and sale  pursuant to the
DRIP. Previously available to registered holders and electric utility customers,
the DRIP has been amended, effective July 2, 1996, to, among other things, allow
any  interested  investor  to enroll in the plan with an initial  investment  of
$250.
   In September 1996 Minnesota  Power  exchanged  473,006 shares of common stock
for all the outstanding  shares of common stock of Alamo Auto Auction,  Inc. and
Alamo Auto Auction Houston,  Inc. The common stock was issued by the Company and
delivered  to the  sellers  in a  private  placement  transaction  that has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests.
   In January  1997 the Company  filed a shelf  registration  to issue up to $80
million in principal amount of Minnesota Power First Mortgage Bonds. On Feb. 20,
1997, the Company sold $60 million of First Mortgage  Bonds,  7% Series due Feb.
15,  2007,  for net proceeds to the Company of $59.4  million.  The net proceeds
along  with  internally  generated  funds  were used for the  retirement  of $60
million in principal amount of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds, 7 3/8% Series
due March 1, 1997.

   Minnesota Power's electric utility first mortgage bonds and secured pollution
control  bonds are  currently  rated the following  investment  grades:  Baa1 by
Moody's  Investor  Services and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's.  The  disclosure of
these  security  ratings  is not a  recommendation  to buy,  sell  or  hold  the
Company's securities.
   In 1996 the Company paid out 90% of its per-share earnings in dividends. Over
the longer term,  Minnesota  Power's goal is to reduce dividend payout to 75% to
80% of earnings.  This is expected to be  accomplished  by  increasing  earnings
rather than reducing dividends.
   Capital Requirements.  Consolidated capital expenditures in 1996 totaled $101
million.  These expenditures  included $38 million for electric operations,  $22
million  for  water  services  and  $41  million  for  automobile  auction  site
relocation  and  development.  Internally  generated  funds and  long-term  bank
financing were used to fund these capital expenditures.
   Capital  expenditures  are expected to be $61 million in 1997 and total about
$260 million for 1998  through  2001.  The 1997 amount  includes $33 million for
electric  system  component  replacement  and  upgrades,  $21  million  to  meet
environmental  standards,  expand water and wastewater  treatment  facilities to
accommodate  customer growth,  and for water  conservation  initiatives,  and $7
million for on-going  improvements  at existing  automobile  auction sites.  The
Company  expects to use  internally  generated  funds and original  issue equity
securities to fund these capital expenditures.
   New Accounting  Standard.  In June 1996 the FASB issued SFAS 125, "Accounting
for  Transfers  and  Servicing  of  Financial  Assets  and   Extinguishments  of
Liabilities," effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 31, 1996. SFAS 125
provides  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  transfers and servicing of
financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities.  The standards are based on
consistent  application  of a  financial  components  approach  that  focuses on
control.  The adoption of SFAS 125 is expected to be immaterial to the Company's
financial position and results of operations.
   Safe Harbor  Statement.  In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), the Company is
hereby filing  cautionary  statements  identifying  important factors that could
cause the Company's actual results to differ  materially from those projected in
forward-looking  statements  (as such term is defined in the Reform Act) made by
or on behalf of the Company in this Annual Report, in presentations, in response
to questions or otherwise.  Any statements that express,  or involve discussions
as to expectations,  beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance (often, but not always,  through the use of words or phrases such as
"anticipates",   "estimates",   "expects",   "intends",   "plans",   "predicts",
"projects",  "will likely result", "will continue", and similar expressions) are
not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.
   Forward-looking statements involve estimates,  assumptions, and uncertainties
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the
following   important   factors,   which  are  difficult  to  predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are  beyond  the  control of the  Company  and may cause  actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:
(i) prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions,  including those of
the FERC, the MPUC, the FPSC, the NCUC, the SCPSC and the PSCW,  with respect to
allowed rates of return,  industry and rate structure,  acquisition and disposal
of assets and  facilities,  operation,  and  construction  of plant  facilities,
recovery of purchased  power,  and present or  prospective  wholesale and retail
competition  (including  but not  limited to retail  wheeling  and  transmission
costs);  (ii) economic and geographic  factors including  political and economic
risks;  (iii) changes in and compliance with  environmental  and safety laws and
policies;  (iv) weather conditions;  (v) population growth rates and demographic
patterns; (vi) competition for retail and wholesale customers; (vii) pricing and
transportation of commodities; (viii) market demand, including structural market
changes;  (ix)  changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of  inflation;  (x)
changes in project costs; (xi)  unanticipated  changes in operating expenses and
capital  expenditures;  (xii) capital market conditions;  (xiii) competition for
new  energy  development  opportunities;  and  (xiv)  legal  and  administrative
proceedings  (whether  civil or criminal)  and  settlements  that  influence the
business and profitability of the Company.
   Any  forward-looking  statement  speaks  only as of the  date on  which  such
statement  is made,  and the  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to update any
forward-looking  statement to reflect events or circumstances  after the date on
which such  statement  is made or to reflect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated
events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to  time  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of such factors,  nor can it assess the impact of each
such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors,  may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  contained in any
forward-looking statement.

                                                                              22

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Minnesota Power

   In our opinion,  the accompanying  consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated  statements  of  income,  of  retained  earnings  and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Minnesota
Power and its  subsidiaries  at December  31, 1996 and 1995,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December 31, 1996,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

Management

   The consolidated  financial  statements and other financial  information were
prepared  by  management,   which  is  responsible   for  their   integrity  and
objectivity.  The financial  statements  have been  prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles and necessarily  include some amounts
that are based on informed  judgments  and best  estimates  and  assumptions  of
management.
   To  meet  its  responsibilities   with  respect  to  financial   information,
management  maintains  and  enforces a system of  internal  accounting  controls
designed to provide assurance,  on a cost effective basis, that transactions are
carried out in accordance with management's  authorizations  and that assets are
safeguarded  against  loss from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The  system
includes an organizational  structure which provides an appropriate  segregation
of  responsibilities,  careful  selection  and  training of  personnel,  written
policies and procedures,  and periodic reviews by the internal audit department.
In addition,  the Company has a personnel policy which requires all employees to
maintain a high standard of ethical conduct.  Management  believes the system is
effective and provides  reasonable  assurance that all transactions are properly
recorded and have been executed in accordance with  management's  authorization.
Management  modifies and improves its system of internal  accounting controls in
response to changes in business  conditions.  The Company's internal audit staff
is charged  with the  responsibility  for  determining  compliance  with Company
procedures.
   Three directors of the Company, not members of management, serve as the Audit
Committee.  The  Board of  Directors,  through  its  Audit  Committee,  oversees
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets
regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants
to discuss  auditing and  financial  matters and to assure that each is carrying
out its responsibilities.  The internal auditors and the independent accountants
have full and free access to the Audit Committee without management present.
   Price  Waterhouse  LLP,  independent  accountants,  are engaged to express an
opinion on the financial statements. Their audit is conducted in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards and includes a review of internal controls
and tests  transactions  to the extent  necessary to allow them to report on the
fairness of the operating results and financial condition of the Company.

2  Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

   Financial  Statement  Preparation.  Minnesota  Power  prepares its  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
principles  require management to make informed judgments and best estimates and
assumptions that (1) affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  (2)
disclose  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of  the  financial
statements,  and (3) report amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
   Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial  statements include
the accounts of the Company and all of its majority owned subsidiary  companies.
All material  intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.
   Nature of Operations and Revenue Recognition. Minnesota Power is a 
diversified utility that has operations in four principal business segments.
   Electric  Operations.  Electric  service is provided to 135,000  customers in
northern  Minnesota and northwestern  Wisconsin.  Large power  customers,  which
include Minnesota's  taconite producers,  paper and wood products  manufacturers
and two pipeline companies,  purchase under contracts, which extend from October
1999 through December 2007, about half of the electricity the Company sells. BNI
Coal,  a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  mines and sells  lignite  coal to two North
Dakota mine-mouth  generating units, one of which is Square Butte.  Square Butte
supplies Minnesota Power with 71% of its output under a long-term contract. (See
Note 17.)
   Electric  rates are under  the  jurisdiction  of  various  state and  federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued  for  service  provided  but  not yet  billed.  Electric  rates  include
adjustment  clauses which bill or credit customers for fuel and purchased energy
costs above or below the base levels in rate schedules and bill retail customers
for the recovery of CIP expenditures not collected in base rates.
   During  1996,  1995 and 1994,  revenue  derived  from one major  customer was
$57.1, $60.4 and $60.2 million, respectively. Revenue derived from another major
customer was $41.2, $44.9 and $45.3 million, respectively.
   Water Services.  Florida Water,  formerly Southern States Utilities,  Inc., a
wholly owned  subsidiary,  is the largest  investor  owned supplier of water and
wastewater utility services in Florida. Heater, another wholly owned subsidiary,
provides  water and wastewater  services in North  Carolina and South  Carolina.
ISI, a wholly owned  subsidiary,  provides  predictive  maintenance  services to
water utility companies and other industrial operations in North Carolina, South
Carolina,  Florida,  Georgia,  Tennessee,  Virginia and Texas. In total, 142,000
water and 56,000 wastewater treatment customers are served. Water and wastewater
rates  are  under the  jurisdiction  of  various  state  and  county  regulatory
authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is accrued for
water sold but not billed.
   Automotive Services.  ADESA, a wholly owned subsidiary,  owns and operates 24
automobile  auctions in the US and  Canada.  ADESA acts as an agent in the sales
process, receiving fees from both buyers and sellers of automobiles.  During the
sales  process,  ADESA does not  generally  take title to  vehicles.  ADESA also
provides a wide range of related  services  such as auto  reconditioning,  title
processing  and  vehicle  transport.  Floorplan  financing  is  provided by AFC.
Revenue is recognized when services are performed.
   Investments.   The  Company's   securities   portfolio   provides  funds  for
reinvestment  and  business  acquisitions.  The Company has a 21%  ownership  in
Capital Re, a financial guaranty  reinsurance  company,  accounted for using the
equity method,  and an 80% ownership in Lehigh,  a Florida real estate business.
Real estate revenue is recognized on the accrual basis.
   Income  Taxes.  The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under  SFAS  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS 109 is an asset and liability  approach that
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax  consequences of temporary  differences  between the carrying amounts
and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities.
   Plant Depreciation. Plant is recorded at original cost. The cost of additions
to plant and  replacement  of  retirement  units of  property  are  capitalized.
Maintenance  costs and  replacements  of minor items of property  are charged to
expense as incurred.  Costs of depreciable units of plant retired are eliminated
from the plant  accounts.  Such costs plus  removal  expenses  less  salvage are
charged to  accumulated  depreciation  for utility  plant.  Plant  stated on the
balance sheet includes  construction  work in progress and is net of accumulated
depreciation.   Various   pollution   abatement   facilities   are  leased  from
municipalities  which have issued pollution control revenue bonds to finance the
cost  of the  facilities.  The  cost of the  facilities  and  the  related  debt
obligation,  which is guaranteed  by the Company,  has been recorded as electric
plant and long-term debt, respectively.
   Depreciation  of utility  plant is computed  using  rates based on  estimated
useful lives of the various classes of property.  Provisions for depreciation of
the average  original cost of depreciable  property  approximated  3.2% in 1996,
3.3% in 1995 and 3% in 1994.  Contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) relate
to water and wastewater plant  contributed to the Company by developers and cash
from customers.  CIAC is amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the estimated
life of the asset to which it relates  when placed in service.  Amortization  of
CIAC reduces depreciation expense.
   Fuel, Material and Supplies. Fuel, material and supplies are stated at the 
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.
   Goodwill.  Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  cost  over  net  assets  of
businesses  acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years.
The Company continually  evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred
indicating  that the  remaining  estimated  useful life of  goodwill  may not be
appropriate.  When  factors  indicate  that  goodwill  should be  evaluated  for
possible  impairment,  the Company  uses an estimate of the  acquired  business'
undiscounted  future cash flows  compared to the  carrying  value of goodwill to
determine if a write-off is necessary.

                                                                              28
                                                                              --

   Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. The Company's utility operations are
subject to the  provisions  of SFAS 71,  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation."  The Company  capitalizes as deferred  regulatory  charges
incurred costs which are probable of recovery in future utility rates.  Deferred
regulatory  credits  represent  amounts  expected to be credited to customers in
rates. (See Note 4.)
   Unamortized  Expense,  Discount  and Premium on Debt.  Expense,  discount and
premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.
   Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all investments purchased 
with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
   Foreign  Currency  Translation.  Results of  operations  for ADESA's  foreign
subsidiaries  are  translated  into US dollars using the average  exchange rates
during the period.  Assets and  liabilities are translated into US dollars using
the exchange rate at the balance sheet date,  except for  intangibles  and fixed
assets,  which  are  translated  at  historical  rates.   Resulting  translation
adjustments are recorded as cumulative  translation adjustment under the heading
Capitalization on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.


3  Acquisitions and Divestitures

   Acquisition of Palm Coast. In April 1996 Palm Coast Holdings,  Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Lehigh Acquisition Corporation,  acquired real estate assets
(Palm Coast) from ITT Community  Development  Corp. and other  affiliates of ITT
Industries,   Inc.  (ITT)  for  $34  million.  These  assets  include  developed
residential lots, a real estate contract receivables portfolio and approximately
13,000 acres of  commercial  and other land.  Palm Coast is a planned  community
located between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, Florida.
   ITT's wholly owned subsidiary,  Palm Coast Utility  Corporation  (PCUC),  has
granted an option to the Company  to acquire PCUC's water and wastewater utility
assets in Palm Coast. PCUC provides  services to approximately  12,000 customers
in  Flagler  County,  Florida.  If  the  option  is  exercised,  closing  of the
transaction will be subject to various regulatory approvals.
   Acquisition  of ISI.  In  April  1996 MP  Water  Resources  acquired  all the
outstanding  common  stock  of  Instrumentation  Services,  Inc.,  a  predictive
maintenance  service business,  in exchange for 96,526 shares of Minnesota Power
common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interest.  Prior
period financial results for 1996 have not been restated due to immateriality.
   Acquisition  of Orange  Osceola.  In December 1995 Florida Water acquired the
operating assets of Orange Osceola Utilities for approximately $13 million.  The
acquisition added over 17,000 water customers.
   Sale of Water Plant Assets. In March 1996 Heater of Seabrook,  Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Heater,  sold all of its water and wastewater utility assets
to the Town of Seabrook Island,  South Carolina for $5.9 million.  This sale was
negotiated in  anticipation  of an eminent domain action by the Town of Seabrook
Island,  South  Carolina.  In  December  1996 Heater  sold its  Columbia,  South
Carolina  area water systems to South  Carolina  Water and Sewer,  L.L.C.  Water
services on the  Company's  consolidated  statement of income  includes  pre-tax
gains of $1.7 million from these sales.
   In December 1994 Florida  Water sold all of the assets of its Venice  Gardens
water and  wastewater  utilities to Sarasota  County in Florida (the County) for
$37.6  million.  The  sale  increased  1994 net  income  by  $11.8  million  and
contributed 42 cents to 1994 earnings per share. Water services on the Company's
consolidated  statement of income  includes a pre-tax gain of $19.1 million from
the sale.  This sale was negotiated in  anticipation of an eminent domain action
by the County.
   Acquisition of ADESA.  The Company acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995, for
$167 million in cash. The Company  accounted for the  acquisition as a purchase.
Acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets associated with this acquisition
are being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over  periods not  exceeding  40
years. In January 1996 the Company provided an additional $15 million of capital
in exchange for  1,982,346  original  issue  common stock shares of ADESA.  This
capital contribution increased the Company's ownership interest in ADESA to 83%.
In August 1996 the Company  acquired the  remaining  17%  ownership  interest of
ADESA from the ADESA management  shareholders.  Financial results for ADESA have
been included in the Company's  consolidated  financial statements as of July 1,
1995.
   The following summary presents unaudited pro forma consolidated results as if
the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in ADESA on Jan. 1, 1995. The pro
forma  results  are not  necessarily  indicative  of what  actually  would  have
occurred if the  acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of 1995, nor
are they necessarily  indicative of future consolidated  results.  The pro forma
results should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial
statements and related notes of Minnesota Power.

   In September  1996  Minnesota  Power  exchanged  473,006 shares of its common
stock for all the outstanding common stock of Alamo Auto Auction, Inc. and Alamo
Auto Auction Houston,  Inc. These  acquisitions were accounted for as pooling of
interests. Prior period financial results for 1996 have not been restated due to
immateriality.  Three other  auction  facilities  were also acquired in 1996 and
were accounted for using the purchase  method.  Pro forma  consolidated  results
reflecting these purchases have not been presented due to immateriality.

   Discontinued Operations.  On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its interest
in the paper and pulp  business  to  Consolidated  Papers,  Inc.  (CPI) for $118
million in cash,  plus CPI's  assumption of certain debt and lease  obligations.
The Company is still committed to a maximum  guaranty of $95 million to ensure a
portion of a $33.4  million  annual lease  obligation  for paper mill  equipment
under an  operating  lease  extending to 2012.  CPI has agreed to indemnify  the
Company  for any  payments  the  Company  may make as a result of the  Company's
obligation  relating to this operating lease. The financial results of the paper
and pulp business, including the loss on disposition, have been accounted for as
discontinued operations.

   Exit from  Equipment  Manufacturing  Business.  In June 1995 Reach All ceased
operations  and sold its operating  assets.  Pre-tax  losses from Reach All were
$6.4 million in 1995 and $5.2 million in 1994.

4  Regulatory Matters

   The Company  files for periodic  rate  revisions  with the  Minnesota  Public
Utilities  Commission (MPUC),  the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC),
the  Florida  Public  Service  Commission  (FPSC)  and other  state  and  county
regulatory authorities. The MPUC had regulatory authority over approximately 69%
in 1996, 73% in 1995 and 75% in 1994 of the Company's  total electric  operating
revenue.  Interim rates in Minnesota and Florida are placed into effect, subject
to refund with interest, pending a final decision by the appropriate commission.
   Electric Rate  Proceedings.  The Company's most recent  Minnesota retail case
was filed Jan. 3, 1994.  Interim rates were in effect from March 1, 1994,  until
final rates became  effective on June 1, 1995. The MPUC approved an 11.6% return
on common equity and an overall  increase in annual revenue of $19 million.  The
MPUC also approved revenue neutral rate adjustments which increased  residential
rates 3.5% on Jan. 1, 1996 and 3.5% on Jan. 1, 1997. The  residential  increases
were offset by lower large power demand charge rates.
   The MPUC also allows the  Company to collect  the cost of fuel  burned  (over
what is already included in the base rate) and the expenditures and lost margins
related to conservation  improvement  programs  (CIP).  These expenses are being
collected  through an adjustment on the customers'  bills known as the "resource
adjustment."
   Water and Wastewater Rates. 1995 Rate Case.  Florida Water requested an $18.1
million rate increase in June 1995. On Oct. 30, 1996,  the FPSC issued its final
order in the  Florida  Water rate case.  The final order  established  water and
wastewater  rates for all customers of Florida Water  regulated by the FPSC. The
new rates,  which became effective on Sept. 20, 1996,  resulted in an annualized
increase in revenue of approximately $11.1 million. This increase included,  and
was not in addition to, the $7.9 million increase in annualized  revenue granted
as interim  rates  effective  on Jan.  23,  1996.  The FPSC  approved a new rate
structure  called  "capband,"  which replaces  uniform rates.  The new structure
combines the concept of a "cap" on monthly bills at a certain usage level for 85
of  Florida  Water's  facilities  that are more  expensive  to  operate,  with a
"banding,"  or  grouping,  of  rates  paid by  customers  served  by the 56 less
expensive  facilities.  On Nov.  1, 1996,  Florida  Water filed with the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  (Court) an appeal of the FPSC's  final  order
seeking  judicial  review of issues  relating  to the  amount of  investment  in
utility  facilities  recoverable  in rates from current  customers.  Motions for
reconsideration  of the  FPSC's  final  order were  subsequently  filed by other
parties to the rate case.  Therefore,  the Court has postponed  Florida  Water's
appeal  pending the FPSC's  disposition  of the  reconsideration  requests.  The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this  matter.  Florida law  provides
that the new rates be implemented while the order is under appeal.
   1991 Rate Case Refund Order.  Responding to a Florida  Supreme Court decision
addressing the issue of retroactive  ratemaking with respect to another company,
in March 1996 the FPSC voted to reconsider an October 1995 order (Refund  Order)
which would have  required  Florida  Water to refund  about $13  million,  which
includes  interest,  to customers who paid more since October 1993 under uniform
rates than they would have paid under stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order,
the  collection  of the $13 million from  customers  who paid less under uniform
rates would not be  permitted.  The Refund  Order was in response to the Florida
First  District  Court of Appeals  reversal in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order
which  imposed  uniform  rates  for most of  Florida  Water's  service  areas in
Florida.  With "uniform  rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the
same rates for water and wastewater  services.  Uniform rates are an alternative
to "stand-alone" rates which are based on the cost of serving each service area.
The FPSC reconsidered the Refund Order, but upheld its decision to order refunds
in August 1996.  Florida  Water filed an appeal of this  decision with the First
District  Court of  Appeals.  A decision on the appeal is  anticipated  by early
1998. The Company continues to believe that it would be improper for the FPSC to
order a refund  to one  group of  customers  without  permitting  recovery  of a
similar  amount from the remaining  customers  since the First District Court of
Appeals  affirmed the Company's  total  revenue  requirement  for  operations in
Florida.

                                                                              30
                                                                              --
<PAGE>

No provision  for refund has been  recorded.  The Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.
   Florida Jurisdictional Issues. In June 1995 the FPSC issued an order assuming
jurisdiction over Florida Water facilities  statewide following an investigation
of all of Florida Water's facilities.  Several counties in Florida appealed this
FPSC decision to the First District Court of Appeals. In December 1996 the Court
issued an opinion  reversing the FPSC order.  In December 1996, the FPSC filed a
motion for clarification and for rehearing with the Court. The Court denied this
motion in January 1997. The FPSC voted in January 1997 to require  Florida Water
to charge rates to customers in Hernando County based on a modified  stand-alone
rate structure. The imposition of this rate structure would reduce Florida Water
revenue by $1.6 million on a  prospective  annual  basis.  No order has yet been
issued  reflecting this vote.  Florida Water is considering an appeal of such an
order.  In the event county  regulation of water and wastewater  rates prevails,
the Company  anticipates that the regulatory  process will become  significantly
more complex and expensive.
   Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. Based on current rate treatment, the
Company believes all deferred regulatory charges are probable of recovery.

5  Financial Instruments

   Securities Investments.  The majority of the Company's securities investments
are  primarily  stocks of other utility  companies  with  investment  grade debt
securities  outstanding  and are  considered  by the Company to be  conservative
investments.  The Company also has investments in four limited partnerships that
invest in equity and debt securities.
   Investments in equity and debt securities are classified in two categories on
the balance sheet:  Trading securities are those bought and held principally for
near-term sale. They are recorded at fair value as part of current assets,  with
changes in fair value during the period included in earnings. Available-for-sale
securities,  which are held for an  indefinite  period of time,  are recorded at
fair value in investments.  Changes in fair value during the period are recorded
net of tax as a separate  component of common stock equity. If the fair value of
any  available-for-sale  securities  declines  below  cost  and the  decline  is
considered  other than temporary,  the securities are written down to fair value
and the losses  charged to earnings.  Realized  gains and losses are computed on
each specific investment sold.

   Off-Balance-Sheet  Risks. In portfolio  strategies  designed to reduce market
risks,  the Company  sells common stock  securities  short and enters into short
sales of treasury futures contracts.
   Selling  common  stock  securities  short is intended to reduce  market price
risks associated with holding common stock  securities in the Company's  trading
securities portfolio.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses from short sales
of common stock securities are included in investment income.
   Treasury  futures  are used as a cross  hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks
associated  with  holding  fixed  dividend  preferred  stocks  included  in  the
Company's  available-for-sale  portfolio.  Changes in market  values of treasury
futures are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the underlying
hedged item. Gains and losses on treasury futures are deferred and recognized in
investment income concurrently with gains and losses arising from the underlying
hedged item. Generally,  treasury futures contracts entered into have a maturity
date of 90 days.
   As a consequence of refunding  industrial revenue bonds, in July 1996 Florida
Water entered into a five-year  interest rate

<PAGE>

swap agreement to exchange fixed for floating  interest  rates,  which are reset
quarterly,  over the life of the swap  agreement  without  the  exchange  of the
underlying  notional  amounts  totaling $30 million.  The interest  rate swap is
subject to market  risk due to  fluctuation  of interest  rates.
   Under the swap agreement, Florida Water is required to make quarterly
interest payments to the counterparty  at a  variable  rate  based  upon a
weighted  average  of the PSA Municipal Swap Index (4.11% at Dec. 31, 1996),
while the counterpart is required to make  quarterly  interest  payments to
Florida  Water at an annual fixed rate (4.79% at Dec. 31, 1996).
   The notional amounts summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged and
are not a measure of the Company's financial exposure. The amounts  exchanged
are  calculated on the basis of these  notional  amounts and other terms which
relate to the change in interest rates and securities  prices. The Company
continually  evaluates the credit  standing of  counterparties  and market
conditions with respect to its off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments. The
Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations or
any material  adverse impact to its financial  position from these  financial
instruments.

   Fair Value of Financial  Instruments.  The  carrying  amount of cash and cash
equivalents,  trading securities, notes and other accounts receivable, and notes
payable  approximates  fair  value  because  of  the  short  maturity  of  those
instruments.  The Company records its trading and available-for-sale  securities
at fair  value  based on quoted  market  prices.  The fair  values for all other
financial instruments were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues.

   Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial  instruments that subject the Company
to   concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  trade  and  other
receivables.  The Company  sells  electricity  to about 14 customers in northern
Minnesota's taconite,  and paper and wood products industries.  At Dec. 31, 1996
and 1995,  receivables from these customers  totaled $6.9 and $7.6 million.  The
Company does not obtain collateral to support utility receivables,  but monitors
the credit  standing of major  customers.  The Company has not incurred and does
not  expect  to incur  significant  credit  losses.  At Dec.  31,  1996 and 1995
approximately  $23 and $29 million of trade accounts  receivable at AFC were due
from automobile dealers. AFC has possession of car titles  collateralizing these
amounts.
   Sale of Finance Receivables.  Effective Dec. 31, 1996, AFC sold a $50 million
participation in its finance  receivables to a third party purchaser.  Under the
terms of the purchase  agreement,  the purchaser agrees to make reinvestments of
up to $100  million to the  extent  that such  reinvestments  are  supported  by
eligible receivables. The purchase agreement terminates Dec. 31, 2001.

   Shareholder  Rights  Plan.  On July 24,  1996,  the Board of Directors of the
Company  adopted a rights  plan  (Rights  Plan)  pursuant to which it declared a
dividend  distribution  of one preferred  share  purchase right (Right) for each
outstanding  share of  common  stock to  shareholders  of record at the close of
business on July 24, 1996,  (the Record Date) and authorized the issuance of one
Right  with  respect  to each share of common  stock  that  becomes  outstanding
between the Record Date and July 23,  2006,  or such  earlier time as the Rights
are redeemed.
   Each Right will be  exercisable to purchase one  one-hundredth  of a share of
Junior Serial Preferred Stock A, without par value, at an exercise price of $90,
subject to adjustment,  following a distribution date which shall be the earlier
to occur of (i) 10 days following a public  announcement  that a person or group
(Acquiring  Person) has acquired,  or obtained the right to acquire,  beneficial
ownership  of 15% or more of the  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock  (Stock
Acquisition  Date)  or (ii) 15  business  days  (or  such  later  date as may be
determined by the Board of Directors  prior to the time that any person  becomes
an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or a public  announcement of
an intention to make, a tender or exchange offer if, upon consummation  thereof,
such person would meet the 15% threshold.
   Subject to certain exempt  transactions,  in the event that the 15% threshold
is met, each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring Person) will thereafter
have the right to receive,  upon exercise at the then current  exercise price of
the Right, common stock (or, in certain  circumstances,  cash, property or other
securities of the Company)  having a value equal to two times the exercise price
of the Right. If, at any time following the Stock  Acquisition Date, the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more
of the Company's  assets or earning power are sold,  each Right will entitle the
holder (other than the Acquiring  Person) to receive,  upon exercise at the then
current exercise price of the Right,  common stock of the acquiring or surviving
company  having a value  equal to two times  the  exercise  price of the  Right.
Certain stock acquisitions will also trigger a provision permitting the Board of
Directors to exchange each Right for one share of common stock.
   The Rights are nonvoting and expire on July 23, 2006,  unless redeemed by the
Company  at a price  of $.01 per  Right  at any time  prior to the time a person
becomes  an  Acquiring  Person.  The  Board  of  Directors  has  authorized  the
reservation  of one  million  shares  of  Junior  Serial  Preferred  Stock A for
issuance under the Rights Plan in the event of exercise of the Rights.

available  through  short-term  bank loans and provide  support  for  commercial
paper.  At Dec.  31,  1996 and  1995  the  Company  had  bank  lines  of  credit
aggregating  $84 and $118  million,  respectively,  of  which  $84  million  was
available  for use at the end of each  year.  At Dec.  31,  1996 and  1995,  the
Company had issued  commercial  paper with face values of $155 and $63  million,
respectively,  with liquidity provided by bank lines of credit and the Company's
securities portfolio.
   Certain  lines of credit  require a commitment  fee of 1/10 of 1% and/or a 5%
compensating  balance.  Interest rates on commercial  paper and borrowings under
the lines of credit range from 6.0% to 8.0% at Dec.  31, 1996,  and 6.0% to 9.5%
at Dec. 31, 1995. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings at
Dec.  31, 1996 and 1995,  was 5.7% and 6.1%.  The total  amount of  compensating

cost  included in electric  plant at Dec.  31, 1996 and 1995,  was $304 and $303
million. The corresponding provisions for accumulated depreciation were $129 and
$123 million.
                                                                              34

12  Leasing Agreements

   ADESA leases auction facilities located in North Carolina,  Massachusetts and
Tennessee  from an unrelated  third party.  The term of these leases is for five
years  ending 2001 with no renewal  options.  However,  at the  beginning of the
fourth  year of the lease  term,  ADESA has the  option to  purchase  the leased
facilities at an aggregate  price of $26.5 million.  In the event ADESA does not
exercise its option to purchase,  ADESA is required to guarantee any  deficiency
in sales  proceeds the lessor  realizes in  disposing  of the leased  properties
should the  selling  price fall below  $25.7  million.  ADESA is entitled to any
excess sales proceeds over the option price. ADESA has guaranteed the payment of
principal  and interest on the  lessor's  indebtedness  which  consists of $25.7
million of mortgage  notes,  due Aug. 1, 2000.  Interest on the notes accrues at
9.82% per annum and is payable monthly.
   The Company leases other properties and equipment in addition to those listed
above  pursuant to operating and capital lease  agreements  with terms  expiring
through 2008. Aggregate amounts of future minimum lease payments for capital and
operating leases during each of the next five years are $10.7, $7.5, $10.0, $3.8
and $2.9  million in 1997,  1998,  1999,  2000 and 2001.  Total rent expense was
$7.4, $1.6 and $2.0 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.


13  Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of MP&L Capital I

   MP&L Capital I (Trust) was  established  as a wholly owned  business trust of
the Company for the purpose of issuing  common and preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  On March 20, 1996, the Trust  publicly  issued three million 8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial  interests in the assets held by the Trust.  The proceeds of the sale
of the QUIPS, and of common securities of the Trust to the Company, were used by
the  Trust  to  purchase   from  the  Company  $77.5  million  of  8.05%  Junior
Subordinated Debentures, Series A, Due 2015 (Subordinated Debentures), resulting
in net  proceeds  to the  Company  of $72.3  million.  Holders  of the QUIPS are
entitled to receive  quarterly  distributions  at an annual rate of 8.05% of the
liquidation  preference value of $25 per security.  The Company has the right to
defer interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures which would result in the
similar deferral of distributions on the QUIPS during extension periods of up to
20 consecutive quarters, provided that no single distribution payment period, as
extended, may exceed 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods or extend
beyond the maturity of the Junior  Subordinated  Debentures.  The Company is the
owner of all the common trust securities,  which constitute  approximately 3% of
the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust Securities.  The sole asset of
the Trust is the Subordinated Debentures, interest on which is deductible by the
Company for income tax purposes.  The Trust will use interest  payments received
on the Subordinated Debentures it holds to make the quarterly cash distributions
on the QUIPS.
   The  QUIPS  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  upon  repayment  of  the
Subordinated  Debentures  at  maturity or upon  redemption.  The Company has the
option  at any time on or after  March 20,  2001,  to  redeem  the  Subordinated
Debentures,  in whole or in part.  The  Company  also has the  option,  upon the
occurrence  of  certain  events,  (i) to  redeem  at any time  the  Subordinated
Debentures,  in whole but not in part,  which would result in the  redemption of
all the Trust Securities,  or (ii) to terminate the Trust and cause the pro rata
distribution  of the  Subordinated  Debentures  to  the  holders  of  the  Trust
Securities.
   In addition to the Company's  obligations under the Subordinated  Debentures,
the Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, payment of distributions on
the Trust  Securities,  to the extent the Trust has funds  available to pay such
distributions,  and has  agreed to pay all of the  expenses  of the Trust  (such
additional  obligations  collectively,  the  Back-up  Undertakings).  Considered
together, the Back-up Undertakings constitute a full and unconditional guarantee
by the Company of the Trust's obligations under the QUIPS.

   Tax Benefits.  The Company,  through  Lehigh,  a 67% owned  subsidiary at the
time,  acquired the stock of Lehigh  Corporation in a bargain  purchase in 1991.
Lehigh  then  began  execution  of a  business  strategy  pursuant  to which the
majority of the  acquired  real estate  assets  would be disposed of over a five
year period. An additional interest in Lehigh was purchased in 1993 bringing the
Company's ownership interest to 80%. The structure of the transactions  involved
the acquisition of stock so the tax bases of the underlying acquired assets were
carried over for income tax purposes.  The  carried-over  tax bases exceeded the
book bases  assigned in purchase  accounting.  The  Internal  Revenue Code (IRC)
limits the use of tax losses  resulting  from the higher tax basis over the fair
market  value of the  underlying  assets  for a period of five  years.  The 1993
increase in ownership by the Company to 80%,  which resulted in the inclusion of
Lehigh and Lehigh Corporation in the Company's  consolidated tax return, started
another five year limitation period.
   SFAS 109 was adopted on a  prospective  basis  effective  Jan. 1, 1993.  Upon
adoption,  a valuation  reserve was established for the entire amount of the tax
benefits  attributable  to the bases  differences  and  alternative  minimum tax
credits because, in management's  judgment,  realization of the tax benefits was
not "more  likely  than not." This  judgment  was based on the  unlikelihood  of
realizing the tax benefits due to the IRC restrictions, in light of management's
existing five year property  disposal  plan.  This situation  continued  through
1994.
   In 1995 Lehigh  implemented  a business  strategy  which called for Lehigh to
dispose  of its  remaining  real  estate  assets  with a specific  view  towards
maximizing  realization of the tax benefits.  The new strategy was adopted after
the Board of Directors of Lehigh,  including  the  minority  shareholders,  were
convinced of the cash flow benefit to Lehigh of deferring the liquidation of the
remaining real estate  assets.  Accordingly,  in 1995 the valuation  reserve was
reduced by $18.4  million based on a detailed  analysis of the projected  future
taxable income based on the new business strategy.
   In 1996 the remaining  $8.2 million  valuation  reserve was reversed based on
the  projected  positive  impact the  acquisition  of $34 million of real estate
assets at Palm  Coast  would have on  Lehigh's  taxable  income.  The Palm Coast
assets were not considered in the 1995 revised strategy.
    No  provision  has  been  made  for  taxes  on  $19.1  million  of  pre-1993
undistributed  earnings of Capital  Re, an  investment  accounted  for under the
equity  method.  Those  earnings  have been and are  expected  to continue to be
reinvested.  The Company  estimates that $7.9 million of tax would be payable on
the pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re if the Company should sell its
investment.  The Company has recognized  the income tax impact on  undistributed

15  Pension Plans and Benefits

   The Company's Minnesota and Wisconsin utility operations have noncontributory
defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees.  Pension benefits for
employees in Minnesota  and  Wisconsin are fully vested after five years and are
based on years of service and the highest  average monthly  compensation  earned
during four  consecutive  years within the last 15 years of employment.  Company
policy is to fund accrued pension costs,  including amortization of past service
costs,  over 5 to 30 years. Part of the pension cost is capitalized as a cost of
plant construction. Benefits under the Company's noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan for Florida utility operations were frozen as of Dec. 31, 1996.

   Company  policy  is to fund the net  periodic  postretirement  costs  and the
amortization  of the costs  deferred as the amounts are collected in rates.  The
Company is funding these benefits using Voluntary  Employee Benefit  Association
(VEBA)  trusts and an  irrevocable  grantor  trust.  The maximum tax  deductible
contributions  are made to the VEBAs.  The  remainder of the funds are placed in
the irrevocable grantor trust until the funds can be used to make tax deductible
contributions  to the VEBAs.  The funds in the irrevocable  grantor trust do not
qualify as plan  assets for  purposes  of SFAS 106  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

   For measurement purposes, it was assumed per capita health care benefit costs
would increase 10.25% in 1996 and that cost increases would thereafter  decrease
1% each  year  until  stabilizing  at 5.25% in  2002.  Accelerating  the rate of
assumed  health  care  cost  increases  by 1% each  year  would  raise  the 1996
transition  obligation by $3.2 million and service and interest costs by a total
of  $1.1  million.  The  weighted  average  discount  rate  used  in  estimating
accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligations was 7.75% in 1996 and 1995. The
expected  long-term  rate of return on plan  assets was 9% in 1996 and 8.75% for
1995.

16  Employee Stock and Incentive Plans

   Employee Stock  Ownership Plan. The Company has sponsored an ESOP since 1975,
amending it in 1989 and 1990 to establish  two leveraged  accounts.  The Company
accounts for the ESOP in  accordance  with the  American  Institute of Certified
Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position 93-6 (SOP 93-6).
   The 1989 leveraged  ESOP account covers all nonunion  Minnesota and Wisconsin
employees  who work more than 1,000 hours per year and have one year of service.
The  ESOP  used  the  proceeds  from a $16.5  million  15-year  loan at  9.125%,
guaranteed by the Company,  to purchase 633,489 shares of Minnesota Power common
stock on the open market in early 1990.  These  shares  fund  employee  benefits
totaling not less than 2% of the participants' salaries.
   The 1990 leveraged ESOP account covers Minnesota and Wisconsin  employees who
participated  in the  non-leveraged  ESOP plan prior to Aug.  4, 1989.  The ESOP
issued a $75  million  promissory  note at  10.25%  with a term not to exceed 25
years to the Company  (Employer Loan) as consideration for 2.8 million shares of
newly issued  Minnesota  Power common stock in November  1990.  These shares are
used to fund a  benefit  at least  equal  to the  value  of the  following:  (a)
dividends on shares held in participants' 1990 leveraged ESOP accounts which are
used to make loan payments, and (b) the tax savings generated from deducting all
dividends  paid on shares  currently  in the ESOP which were held by the plan on
Aug. 4, 1989.
   The  loans  will be  repaid  with  dividends  received  by the  ESOP and with
employer  contributions.  ESOP  shares  acquired  with the loans were  initially
pledged  as  collateral  for the  loans.  The  ESOP  shares  are  released  from
collateral  and  allocated  to  participants  based on the portion of total debt
service paid in the year.

   Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(ESPP).  At Dec. 31, 1996,  195,097  shares of common stock were held in reserve
for future issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP permits  eligible  employees to buy
up to $23,750  per year in Company  common  stock.  Purchases  are at 95% of the
stock's  closing market price on the first day of each month.  At Dec. 31, 1996,
449,195 shares had been issued under the ESPP.
   Stock Option and Award Plans.  In May 1996 Company  shareholders  approved an
Executive  Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan (the  Executive  Plan) and a
Director  Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the Director Plan),  both effective as
of Jan. 1, 1996.
   The Executive  Plan allows for the grant of up to an aggregate of 2.1 million
shares of common stock to key  employees  of the Company.  Such grants may be in
the form of stock options and other awards, including stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock,  performance units and performance shares. In January 1996 the
Company granted non-qualified stock options to purchase 118,708 shares of common
stock and granted 80,788  performance  shares.  Additionally,  24,000 restricted
shares of common  stock  were  granted,  with the  restriction  expiring  over a
four-year  period.  The  Director  Plan  provides for the grant of up to 150,000
shares of common stock to nonemployee directors of the Company.  Pursuant to the
Director Plan each  nonemployee  director  receives an annual grant of 725 stock
options and a biennial grant of performance  shares equal to $10,000 in value of
common stock on the date of grant.
   The  exercise  price for stock  options is equal to the  market  value of the
common stock on the date of a grant.  Stock  options may be exercised 50% on the
first  anniversary  date  of the  grant  and  the  remaining  50% on the  second
anniversary,  and expire on the tenth anniversary.  Grants of performance shares
are earned over  multi-year  time periods upon the  achievement  of  performance
objectives.
   The Company has elected to recognize  compensation  cost for its  stock-based
compensation  plans in accordance with Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No.
25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  Generally,  no  compensation
expense is recognized for stock options with exercise prices equal to the market
value of the underlying  shares of stock at the date of the grant.  Compensation
cost is recognized over the vesting periods for performance and restricted share
awards based on the market value of the underlying shares of stock.
   Pro  forma   amounts  of  net  income  and  earnings  per  share   reflecting
compensation  cost  determined  based on the fair  value at the grant  dates for
awards under these plans consistent with the method of SFAS 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation,"  have not been presented because the amounts are not
material.  The initial effects of applying SFAS 123 may not be representative of
the pro forma  effects on reported  net income and earnings per share for future
years if additional awards are granted.

17  Square Butte Purchased Power Contract

   Under the terms of a 30-year  contract with Square Butte that extends through
2007,   the  Company  is  purchasing  71%  of  the  output  from  a  mine-mouth,
lignite-fired  generating  plant  capable  of  generating  up to  470  MW.  This
generating unit (Project) is located near Center,  N.D.  Reductions to about 49%
of the output are  provided  for in the  contract  and,  at the option of Square
Butte,  could begin after a five-year advance notice to the Company and continue
for the remaining  economic life of the Project.  The Company has the option but
not the obligation to continue to purchase 49% of the output after 2007.
   The Project is leased to Square Butte through Dec. 31, 2007, by certain banks
and their  affiliates  which have  beneficial  ownership in the Project.  Square
Butte has  options  to renew the lease  after  2007 for  essentially  the entire
remaining economic life of the Project.
   The Company is  obligated  to pay Square  Butte all Square  Butte's  leasing,
operating  and debt service costs (less any amounts  collected  from the sale of
power or energy to others)  that  shall not have been paid by Square  Butte when
due.  These costs  include the price of lignite  coal  purchased by Square Butte
under a cost-plus contract with BNI Coal. The Company's cost of power and energy
purchased  from Square  Butte during  1996,  1995 and 1994 was $58.2,  $57.6 and
$55.4 million,  respectively.  The leasing costs of Square Butte included in the
cost of power  delivered to the Company totaled $19.1 million in 1996, and $19.3
million in 1995 and in 1994,  which included  approximately  $10.2,  $11 and $12
million,  respectively,  of interest expense. The annual fixed lease obligations
of the Company for Square Butte are $20.1  million from 1997  through  2001.  At
Dec. 31, 1996,  Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $207  million.  The
Company's  obligation is absolute and unconditional  whether or not any power is
actually delivered to the Company.
   The  Company's  payments to Square Butte for power and energy are approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.
   One principal reason the Company entered into the agreement with Square Butte
was to obtain a power supply for large  industrial  customers.  Present electric
service contracts with these customers require payment of minimum monthly demand
charges that cover a portion of the fixed costs  associated with having capacity
available  to serve  them.  These  contracts  minimize  the  negative  impact on
earnings that could result from significant  reductions in kilowatthour sales to
industrial  customers.  The initial  minimum  contract  term for the large power
customers  is 10  years,  with a  four-year  cancellation  notice  required  for
termination  of the  contract at or beyond the end of the tenth year.  Under the
terms of existing  contracts  as of Feb.  1, 1997,  the  Company  would  collect
approximately  $101.6,  $89.2, $80.3, $70.1 and $61.9 million under current rate
levels  for firm  power  during  the  years  1997,  1998,  1999,  2000 and 2001,
respectively,  even if no power or energy were supplied to these customers after
Dec. 31, 1996.  The minimum  contract  provisions  are expressed in megawatts of
demand,  and if rates  change,  the amounts the Company  would collect under the
contracts will change in proportion to the change in the demand rate.
