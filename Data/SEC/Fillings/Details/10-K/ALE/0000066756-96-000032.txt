* On June 30, 1995, the Company sold the interest in its paper and pulp business
to CPI for $118 million in cash, plus CPI's assumption of certain debt and lease
obligations.  The  Company  is still  committed  to a maximum  guarantee  of $95
million to ensure a portion of a $33.4 million annual lease obligation for paper
mill  equipment  under an operating  lease  extending to 2012. CPI has agreed to
indemnify  the Company for any  payments the Company may make as a result of the
Company's obligation relating to this operating lease.
         Since 1983 Minnesota Power has been diversifying to reduce its reliance
on electricity  sales to Minnesota's  taconite  industry and to gain  additional
earnings  growth   potential.   Acquisitions   have  been  a  primary  means  of
diversification. The Company's most recent acquisition occurred in 1995 when the
Company acquired an 80 percent ownership in ADESA, the third largest  automobile
auction business in the United States. In January 1996 the Company increased its
ownership in ADESA to 83 percent.

Operations  in the  Minnesota  Power 1995 Annual  Report.  For business  segment

                               Electric Operations

         Electric   operations   generate,   transmit,   distribute   and   sell
electricity.  In addition to Minnesota Power, five wholly owned subsidiaries are
also included in electric  operations - SWL&P, BNI Coal,  Rainy River,  Synertec
and Upper Minnesota Properties, Inc.

           -  Minnesota  Power  provides  electricity  in a 26,000  square mile
              electric service  territory located in northern  Minnesota.  As of
              December 31, 1995,  Minnesota Power was supplying  retail electric
              service to 122,000 customers in 153 cities, towns and communities,
              and outlying rural areas. The largest city served is Duluth with a
              population of 85,000 based on the 1990 census.  Wholesale electric
              service  for  resale  is  supplied  to 13  municipal  distribution
              systems,  one  private  utility  and  SWL&P.   Wholesale  non-firm
              electric  service  is  provided  to  two  customers.  Transmission
              service (wheeling) is provided to four customers.

           -  Superior  Water,  Light and Power Company sells  electricity  and
              natural gas, and provides water service in northwestern Wisconsin.
              As of December 31, 1995,  SWL&P served 14,000 electric  customers,
              11,000 natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers.

           -  BNI Coal owns and  operates a lignite mine in North  Dakota.  Two
              electric  generating  cooperatives,  Minnkota  and  Square  Butte,
              presently  consume  virtually  all of  BNI  Coal's  production  of
              lignite coal under coal supply agreements extending to 2027. Under
              an  agreement  with Square  Butte,  Minnesota  Power  purchases 71
              percent of the output from the Square  Butte unit which is capable
              of generating  up to 470 MW.  Minnkota has an option to extend its
              coal supply agreement to 2042. (See - Fuel and Note 12.)

           -  Rainy  River  and   Synertec   provide   planning,   construction
              management and operating services to new and expanding businesses,
              and  have  the  ability  to   participate   as  an  investor  when
              appropriate.
              
           -  Upper  Minnesota  Properties,  Inc. has invested in affordable  
              housing  projects  located in Minnesota  Power's  electric service
              territory.

Electric Sales

         The two major  industries in Minnesota  Power's  service  territory are
taconite  production,  and  paper  and wood  products  manufacturing.  These two
industries  contributed about half of the Company's  electric  operating revenue
from 1993 through 1995.

         Over the last five years,  79 percent of the  domestic  ore consumed by
iron and steel plants in the United States has originated from plants within the
Company's Minnesota electric service territory.  Taconite,  an iron-bearing rock
of relatively low iron content which is abundantly available in Minnesota, is an
important  domestic  source of raw  material  for the steel  industry.  Taconite
processing   plants  use  large  quantities  of  electric  power  to  grind  the
ore-bearing  rock and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite
pellets. Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 47 million tons in 1995, 43
million tons in 1994, 41 million tons in 1993,  40 million tons in 1992,  and 41
million  tons in 1991.  The  Company  estimates  that  1996  Minnesota  taconite
production will be about 48 million tons. While taconite  production is expected
to continue near record setting  levels,  the long-term  future of this cyclical
industry  is less  certain.  Even  with  the  Company's  commitment  to help the
taconite customers remain  competitive,  it is possible  production will decline
gradually some time after the year 2005.

                                      -2-

         The Company  continues to explore  opportunities to expand services and
assistance  provided  to its  customers,  as well as increase  sales  beyond the
Company's traditional service territory.

(1)  The Company's largest customers, Minntac and Hibbing Taconite,  represented
     12 percent  and 9 percent,  respectively,  of total  electric  revenue  and
     income in 1995, and 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in 1994 and in
     1993.
          
(2)  The Company sold 183 MW of firm energy to resale  customers  in 1995.  (See
     Regulatory Issues - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.)

         Large Power Customer Contracts

         The Company  has Large  Power  Customer  contracts  with five  taconite
producers,  five  paper  manufacturers  and  a  pipeline  company  (Large  Power
Customers). Large Power Customer contracts require the Company to have a certain
amount of capacity  available at all times (Firm Power).  Each contract requires
10 MW or more of power and  payment  of a minimum  monthly  demand  charge  that
covers most of the fixed costs  associated  with having  capacity  available  to
serve the customer, including a return on common equity. Such contracts minimize
the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from  significant  reductions
in kilowatt-hour sales to such customers.  These contracts, which are subject to
MPUC  approval,  have a minimum  contract  term of ten years  initially,  with a
four-year  cancellation  notice  required for  termination  of the contact at or
beyond the end of the tenth year. The rates and corresponding revenue associated
with capacity and energy  provided  under these  contracts are subject to change
through the same regulatory  process  governing all retail electric rates.  (See
Regulatory  Issues-Electric  Rates.) 

         As of March 15, 1996, the minimum annual revenue the Company would
collect under contracts with these Large Power  Customers,  assuming no electric
energy use by these  customers,  is  estimated  to be $103.8,  $92.0,  $80.1, 
$62.9 and $49.2 million during the years 1996,  1997,  1998,  1999 and 2000, 
respectively.  The Company  believes actual revenue  received from these Large
Power Customers will be substantially in excess of the minimum contract amounts.

- ------------------------------

The following terms are used in the contract descriptions footnoted below.

Firm demand is a take-or-pay obligation which is the sum of contract demand plus
incremental demand.
  
Incremental production service is billed on an energy only basis for energy used
above a customer's  specific demand  threshold.  This service does not include a
take-or-pay obligation.

Interruptible  service  is  electrical  service  for  a  customer  that  may  be
interrupted by the Company under certain conditions. In return for this service,
customers receive a reduced demand charge,  but are obligated to the Company for
future service requirements.

Replacement  firm power  service is electric  service  that is  provided  when a
customer's  generating  units are  unavailable  due to  planned  or  unscheduled
outages.

<F1> Participation  power  purchase  contracts  require  the  Company to pay the
     demand  charges  for MW under  contract  and an energy  charge for each MWh
     purchased.  The selling  entity is obligated to provide energy as scheduled
     by the Company from the generating unit specified in the contract as energy
     is available from that unit.

<F2> Under an  agreement  extending  through 2007 with Square  Butte,  Minnesota
     Power  purchases 71 percent of the output of a mine-mouth  generating  unit
     located  near  Center,  North  Dakota.  The Square Butte unit is one of two
     lignite-fired  units  at  Minnkota  Power  Cooperative's  Milton  R.  Young
     Generating  Station.  Reductions  to about 49  percent  of the  output  are
     provided  for in the  contract  and, at the option of Square  Butte,  could
     begin  after a five-year  advance  notice to the  Company.  The cost of the
     power and energy purchased is a proportionate share of Square Butte's fixed
     obligations and operating  costs which are not incurred  unless  production
     takes place.  The Company is responsible  for paying all costs and expenses
     of Square Butte (including  leasing,  operating and any debt service costs)
     if  not  paid  by  Square   Butte   when   due.   These   obligations   and
     responsibilities of the Company are absolute and unconditional,  whether or
     not any power is actually delivered to the Company. (See Note 12.)

<F3> Firm power purchase contracts require the Company to pay demand charges for
     MW under contract and an energy charge for each MWh purchased.  The selling
     entity is obligated to provide energy as scheduled by the Company.

Fuel

         The Company has experienced no difficulty in obtaining an adequate fuel
supply. The Company purchases  low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal from the Powder
River Basin coal field located in Montana and Wyoming to meet  substantially all
of its coal supply requirements. Coal consumption for electric generation at the
Company's Minnesota coal-fired generating stations in 1995 was about 3.6 million
tons. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had a coal inventory of about 431,305
tons.  During  1995,  the  Company  obtained  its coal  through  both  long- and
short-term  agreements.  A long-term  agreement  (January 1993 through May 1997)
with Big Sky Coal Company enables the Company to purchase up to 2.5 million tons
of coal on an annualized  basis from the Big Sky Mine.  Additionally,  in August
1994 the Company  entered into a separate  agreement  (November 1994 through May
1997) with Big Sky Coal Company to purchase an  additional  600,000 tons of coal
on an  annualized  basis from the Big Sky Mine.  The Company also  obtained coal
under one-year  agreements from Kennecott Energy Company's Spring Creek Mine and
Western  Energy  Company's  Rosebud  Mine.  The Company will obtain coal in 1996
under a new  long-term  agreement  with  Kennecott  Energy  Company,  a one-year
agreement  with Decker Coal Company,  and will continue to obtain coal under its
long-term agreements with Big Sky Coal Company.  This mix of coal supply options
allows the Company to reduce market risk and to take advantage of favorable spot
market prices.  The Company is exploring future coal supply options and believes
that adequate  supplies of low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal will continue to be
available.

         Burlington  Northern Santa Fe Railroad,  formerly  Burlington  Northern
Railroad,  transports  the coal by unit  train  from  Montana  or Wyoming to the
Company's  generating  stations.  The

Company and  Burlington  Northern  Santa Fe  Railroad  have two  long-term  coal
freight-rate  contracts that provide for coal deliveries  through 2002 to Laskin
and through  2003 to Boswell.  The Company  also has a contract  with the Duluth
Missabe & Iron Range  Railway  which is the final  destination  short-hauler  to
Laskin.  This contract provides for deliveries through 2002. The delivered price
of coal is subject to periodic adjustments in freight rates.

         The  generating  unit  operated  by Square  Butte,  which is capable of
generating  up to 470 MW, burns North Dakota  lignite that is being  supplied by
BNI Coal, a wholly owned  subsidiary of the Company,  pursuant to the terms of a
contract  expiring in 2027.  Square  Butte's cost of lignite  burned in 1995 was
approximately  66 cents per MBtu. The lignite acreage that has been dedicated to
Square Butte by BNI Coal is located on lands  essentially all of which are under
private  control  and  presently  leased by BNI  Coal.  This  lignite  supply is
sufficient to provide the fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating
unit.   Under  the  various   agreements  with  Square  Butte,  the  Company  is
unconditionally  obligated  to pay all costs not paid by Square  Butte when due.
These costs include the price of lignite  purchased  under a cost-plus  contract
from BNI Coal. (See Item 2. Properties and Note 12.) BNI Coal has experienced no
difficulty in supplying all of Square Butte's lignite requirements.

Regulatory Issues

         The Company and its  subsidiaries  are exempt from regulation under the
Public Utility Holding  Company Act of 1935,  except as to Section 9(a)(2) which
relates to acquisition of securities of public utility operations.
         The Company and its  subsidiaries  are subject to the  jurisdiction  of
various regulatory authorities. The MPUC has regulatory authority over Minnesota
Power's service area, retail rates, retail services,  issuance of securities and
other matters.  The FERC has  jurisdiction  over the licensing of  hydroelectric
projects, the establishment of rates and charges for the sale of electricity for
resale and for transmission of electricity in interstate  commerce,  and certain
accounting and record keeping practices.  The PSCW has regulatory authority over
the retail sales of electricity, water and gas by SWL&P. The MPUC, FERC and PSCW
had  regulatory   authority  over  56  percent,   7  percent,   and  6  percent,
respectively, of the Company's 1995 total operating revenue and income.

         Electric Rates

         The Company has historically  designed its electric service rates based
on cost of service  studies  under  which  allocations  are made to the  various
classes of customers. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses
which  adjust  electric  service  rates  for  changes  in the  cost of fuel  and
purchased energy, and recovery of current and deferred CIP expenditures.
         The  Company's  current  policy  for all  contracts  with  Large  Power
Customers is to require a minimum  initial  contract  term of ten years with the
term perpetuated  thereafter (continuous term) subject to a minimum cancellation
notice of four years.  The Company's  Firm Power rate  schedules are designed to
recover  the fixed  costs of  providing  Firm  Power to Large  Power  Customers,
including a return on common equity, regardless of the amount of power or energy
actually used. A Large Power Customer's  monthly demand charge obligation in any
particular  

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
month is determined  based upon the greater of its actual demand for electricity
or the firm demand  amount.  Contract and rate schedule  provisions  provide for
adjustment if the customer's firm demand amount is set  significantly  below the
customer's actual electric  requirements.  The rates and  corresponding  revenue
associated  with capacity and energy  provided under these contracts are subject
to change through the regulatory  process  governing all retail  electric rates.
Contracts  with ten of the eleven  Large Power  Customers  provide for  deferral
without  interest  or  diminishment  of one-half  of demand  charge  obligations
incurred  during  the first  three  months of a strike or  illegal  walkout at a
customer's  facilities,   with  repayment  required  over  the  12-month  period
following resolution of the work stoppage.
         The Company also has contracts  with large  industrial  and  commercial
customers  who  require  more than 2 MW but less than 10 MW of  capacity  (Large
Light and Power Customers). The terms of these contracts vary depending upon the
customers'  demand for power and the cost of extending the Company's  facilities
to provide electric  service.  Generally,  the contracts for less than 3 MW have
one-year terms and the contracts  ranging from 3 to 10 MW have initial five-year
terms.  The  Company's  rate  schedule  for Large Light and Power  Customers  is
designed  to  minimize  fluctuations  in revenue  and to  recover a  significant
portion of the fixed costs of providing service to such customers.
         The Company requires that all large industrial and commercial customers
under contract specify the date when power is first required, and thereafter the
customer is billed for at least the minimum power for which it contracted. These
conditions are part of all contracts  covering power to be supplied to new large
industrial and commercial  customers and to current contract  customers as their
contracts expire or are amended. All contracts provide that new rates which have
been  approved  by  appropriate   regulatory  authorities  will  be  substituted
immediately  for obsolete  rates,  without  regard to any unexpired  term of the
existing  contract.  All rate  schedules are subject to approval by  appropriate
regulatory authorities.

         Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

         The FERC has jurisdiction over the Company's wholesale electric service
resale customers and transmission service (wheeling) customers. In a filing with
the FERC on December 22, 1995, the Company requested an overall rate decrease of
$138,000 or 0.4 percent  with an effective  date of January 1, 1996.  All of the
customers  affected by the rate change have  submitted  written  consents to the
rate change and effective  date.  Minor  modifications  to the rate request were
made in an amendment  filed on January 16, 1996. The Company expects final rates
to be effective by March 31, 1996.
         The  Company  has  contracts  through at least 2007 with  twelve of the
thirteen Minnesota  municipalities  receiving full requirements  resale service.
The December  1995 FERC filing  includes a proposed  contract  amendment for the
remaining full requirements municipality to extend its current contract with the
Company from 1999 to 2009.  The  thirteen  contracts  for the full  requirements
customers  limit rate  increases  (including  fuel costs) to about 2 percent per
year on a cumulative basis. In 1995 the 13 municipal  customers  purchased 88 MW
of Firm Power from the Company.
         Two  municipalities  whose  requirements are only partially supplied by
the Company  have  contracts  with the Company  through  1999.  These  municipal
customers  signed  amendments  under which the Company  will  provide  exclusive
brokering service for the  municipalities'  purchases of economy energy and will
supply emergency,  scheduled outage and firm energy as required through 1999. In
1995 these two municipalities purchased 168,987 MWh.
         A contract  between  Minnesota  Power and SWL&P  provides  for SWL&P to
purchase its power from the Company through at least 1999 and  incorporates  the
same cap on future rate  increases as discussed  above.  The December  1995 FERC
filing includes a proposed  contract 


                                      -8-
<PAGE>
amendment to extend SWL&P's contract with the Company to at least 2010, with a 2
percent per year cap on rate increases. SWL&P purchased 87 MW of Firm Power from
the Company in 1995.
         The  Company  also  has a  contract  through  December  2004 to  supply
electricity to Dahlberg Light and Power Company  (Dahlberg),  a private utility.
Dahlberg purchased 8 MW of Firm Power from the Company in 1995.
         The Company's  hydroelectric  facilities which are located in Minnesota
are  licensed  by the FERC.  In 1995 the FERC  issued  to the  Company a 30-year
license  for the St.  Louis  River  hydroelectric  project  (87.6 MW  generating
capability).  On May 11, 1995,  a final  application  to relicense  the Pillager
hydroelectric  project (1.5 MW generating  capability)  was filed with the FERC.
(See Environmental Matters - Water.)

         Minnesota Public Utilities Commission

         In  November  1994 the MPUC  issued an order  granting  the  Company an
overall  increase in annual electric  operating  revenue of $19 million,  or 6.4
percent,  with an 11.6 percent return on equity.  Effective June 1, 1995,  rates
for large industrial customers increased less than 4 percent, while the rate for
small  businesses  increased 6.5 percent.  The rate  increases  for  residential
customers were approved to be phased in over three years:  13.5 percent began in
June 1995,  3.75 percent in January 1996, and another 3.75 percent will begin in
January 1997.
         Minnesota requires electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5 percent
of gross annual electric revenue on conservation improvement programs (CIP) each
year. In 1995,  1994  and 1993,  the Company spent $14.2,  $8 and $4.1 million,
respectively,  on CIP and expects to spend a total of $6.8 million  during 1996.
The MPUC allows such  conservation  expenditures in excess of amounts  recovered
through  current  rates to be  accumulated  in a deferred  account for  recovery
through future rates.
         Since January 1994 the Company has been recovering ongoing CIP spending
and $8.2  million  of CIP  spending  from  previous  years.  Through  a  billing
adjustment and retail base rates approved by the MPUC, the Company is allowed to
recover  current and deferred CIP  expenditures  and the lost margin  associated
with power  saved as a result of these  programs.  The Company  collected  $10.8
million and $7.8 million of CIP related revenue in 1995 and 1994.
         Minnesota  law enables the Company to offer  retail  customers  special
rates to meet competition from unregulated energy suppliers or cogenerators. The
Company  implemented a generation  deferral rate in November 1990 for Boise.  In
March 1994 the MPUC  approved an amendment to Boise's  contract  which  includes
extension of the generation  deferral rate until December 1998.  While this rate
is lower than the normal retail rate, it provides for recovery of  approximately
$20 million  over the next five years of the  Company's  fixed costs which would
not have been recovered had Boise  installed its own generating  facilities.  In
addition,  special rates were  implemented  in 1993 to attract a new  commercial
customer that has a 1 MW load.  Special rates were also  implemented  in 1995 to
retain a  commercial  customer  with a 3 MW load and in 1996 to  retain  another
commercial customer with an 8 MW load.

         Public Service Commission of Wisconsin

         On  June  16,  1995,  SWL&P  filed  an  application  with the PSCW for
authority to increase  electric,  gas and water rates. The Company  requested an
overall  annual  revenue  increase of $1.3  million,  or 3.2 percent,  with a 12
percent  return  on  equity.  It is  anticipated  that the PSCW  will  approve a
$451,000,  or 1.1 percent  increase,  with an 11.6 percent  return on equity.  A
final  order is  expected on March 29,  1996,  with final rates to be  effective
March 30, 1996.

Capital Expenditure Program

         Capital  expenditures for the electric  operations  totaled $38 million
during 1995, of which $7 million was for coal operations.  Internally  generated
funds and long-term bank financing were used to fund these capital expenditures.
         The Company's  electric  generating  stations have the capacity to meet
customer   needs  through  the  1990s  without  major   capacity   additions  or
environmental  modifications.   Electric  operations  capital  expenditures  are
expected  to be $40  million  in 1996,  of which $6  million  is related to coal
operations.   Approximately   $120  million  of  electric   operations   capital
expenditures  are  expected  during the period 1997 through  2000,  of which $10
million is related to coal operations.  The Company's  estimates of such capital
expenditures  and the sources of financing are subject to continuing  review and
adjustment.

Competition

         The competitive  landscape of the electric utility industry is changing
at both the  wholesale and retail  levels,  and is affecting the way the Company
strategically  views the future. The enactment of the Energy Policy Act resulted
in an  increase  in the  competitive  forces  that  affect  two of the three key
elements of the electric  utility  industry,  generation and  transmission.  The
third element,  distribution,  is subject to state regulation.  This legislation
has  resulted  in a  more  competitive  market  for  electricity  generally  and
particularly in wholesale markets.

         Wholesale

         In 1995 the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NOPR) on Open
Access   Non-Discriminatory   Transmission  Services  by  Public  Utilities  and
Transmitting  Utilities and a supplemental  NOPR on Recovery of Stranded  Costs.
The purpose of the proposed rules is to facilitate  wholesale power competition,
remove undue  discrimination  in electric  transmission  and set  standards  for
recovery of stranded costs through  FERC-approved  rates for wholesale  service.
Final FERC rules are expected to be published by mid-1996.
         The Energy Policy Act increased  competition in the wholesale market by
eliminating  existing  legal  barriers with respect to entry into the generation
market and the provision of transmission services.  First, the Energy Policy Act
created a new class of power  producers,  known as Exempt  Wholesale  Generators
(EWGs). EWGs are exempt from regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 and EWG sales are generally subject to less regulation than sales by
traditional  utilities.  The  fact  that  EWGs  may  include  independent  power
producers as well as affiliates of electric utilities marks a further diminution
of the role of  electric  utilities  as the  exclusive  generators  of  electric
energy.  Second,  the Energy Policy Act authorized  the FERC to order  utilities
which own or operate transmission  facilities to provide wholesale  transmission
services to or from other utilities or entities  generating  electric energy for
sale or resale,  provided that the rates charged for  transmission  services are
recovered  from the entity  seeking  the  transmission  service and not from the
transmitting utility's existing wholesale, retail or transmission customers. The
Energy  Policy  Act  expressly  prohibits  the FERC from  ordering  a utility to
provide retail wheeling services to any of its customers.

         Regional

         The Company is a member of the  Mid-Continent  Area Power Pool  (MAPP).
The MAPP enhances electric service reliability, and provides the opportunity for
members  to enter into  various  wholesale  power  transactions  and  coordinate
planning of new generation and transmission facilities.  The MAPP membership has
approved  an  agreement  that  reorganizes  the power pool to  establish:  (1) a
regional  transmission  group to provide  comparable and efficient  transmission
service on a regional  basis,  coordinate  regional  transmission  planning  and

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
resolve  transmission  service  disputes;  (2) a power  and  energy  market  for
market-based  wholesale  transactions among interested  participants;  and (3) a
generation  reserve sharing pool to maintain and share  generation  reserves for
purposes  of  further  efficiencies.  The  reorganization  is  subject  to  FERC
approval.

         Retail

         In 1995  the  MPUC  initiated  an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  in the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery  of  electric   service   continues  to  be  efficient   following  any
restructuring,  the MPUC adopted 15 principles to guide a deliberate and orderly
approach to developing  reasonable  restructuring  alternatives  that ensure the
fairness of a  competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January
1996 the MPUC established a wholesale competition working group in which company
representatives   will  participate  to  initially  address  issues  related  to
wholesale  competition and then to consider retail  competition issues including
rate flexibility, innovative regulation, unbundling, safety and reliability.
         Large industrial and commercial  customers that have the ability to own
and  operate  their own  generation  facilities  may compete  directly  with the
Company to supply their own electric needs.  If these  facilities are Qualifying
Facilities  (QFs),  the  customers  that own them may  require  that the Company
purchase the output from them at the Company's  "avoided  cost"  pursuant to the
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. Additionally,  these customers,  as well
as the balance of the Company's customers, may elect to substitute other sources
of energy,  such as natural gas,  oil or wood,  for various end uses rather than
continuing to use electric energy.  Municipalities  may elect to serve customers
of the Company lying within municipal boundaries,  but must fully compensate the
Company for its loss of property and revenue associated with this load. Finally,
the prospect that large industrial  customers might seek state  authorization of
retail wheeling in the future would have the effect of substantially  increasing
competition in the retail segment of the market for electricity.

         Customers

         Minnesota  Power  anticipates  that  its  Large  Power  Customers  will
continue to aggressively  seek lower energy costs through  negotiations with the
Company and  consideration of alternative  suppliers.  With electric rates among
the lowest in the United States and with its long-term wholesale and large power
retail  contracts in place,  Minnesota  Power believes it is well  positioned to
address  competitive  pressures.  The Company remains opposed to retail wheeling
because it would benefit only a few large customers while potentially  adversely
impacting smaller customers' rates and shareholder returns.
         In addition to providing electricity,  the Company offers its customers
a wide  variety of  value-added  services,  including  conservation  improvement
services,  to meet their  energy  needs.  The  Company  also has  obtained  MPUC
approval to offer interruptible rates to Large Power Customers. Furthermore, the
Company  may offer  competitive  rates  within its  service  territory  to serve
customers  that could  otherwise  obtain their energy needs from an  unregulated
energy supplier or by generating their own electricity with MPUC approval.

Franchises

         Minnesota Power holds  franchises to construct and maintain an electric
distribution and  transmission  system in 90 cities and towns located within its
service  territory.  SWL&P holds  franchises  in 15 cities and towns  within its
service  territory.  The  remaining  cities  and towns  served  will not grant a
franchise or do not require a franchise to operate within their boundaries.

Environmental Matters

         The Company's electric  operations are subject to regulation by various
federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality,
solid  wastes,  and other  environmental  matters.  The  Company  considers  its
electric  operations to be in substantial  compliance  with those  environmental
regulations  currently  applicable to its  operations and believes all necessary
permits to conduct  such  operations  have been  obtained.  The Company does not
currently  anticipate that its potential capital  expenditures for environmental
matters will be material.  However,  because  environmental laws and regulations
are  constantly   evolving,   the   character,   scope  and  ultimate  costs  of
environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

         Air

         The Federal  Clean Air Act  Amendments  of 1990 (Clean Air Act) require
that  specified  fossil-fueled  generating  plants  meet new sulfur  dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emission  standards  beginning January 1, 1995 (Phase I) and that
virtually all generating  plants meet more strict emission  standards  beginning
January 1, 2000 (Phase II). None of Minnesota Power's generating  facilities are
covered  by the Phase I  requirements  of the Clean Air Act.  However,  Phase II
requirements apply to the Company's Boswell,  Laskin and Hibbard plants, as well
as Square Butte.
         The Clean Air Act creates emission  allowances for sulfur dioxide based
on formulas  relating to the  permitted  1985  emissions  rate and a baseline of
average fossil fuel consumed in the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. Each allowance is
an authorization  to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide,  and each utility must have
sufficient   allowances  to  cover  its  annual  emissions.   Minnesota  Power's
generating  facilities  in  Minnesota  burn mainly  low-sulfur  western coal and
Square  Butte,  located  in  North  Dakota,  burns  lignite  coal.  All of these
facilities  are equipped with  pollution  control  equipment  such as scrubbers,
baghouses  or  electrostatic  precipitators.  Phase II sulfur  dioxide  emission
requirements are currently being met by Boswell Unit 4. Some moderate reductions
in emissions may be necessary for Boswell Units 1, 2 and 3, Laskin Units 1 and
2, and Square Butte to meet the Phase II sulfur dioxide  emission  requirements.
The Company  believes it is in a good position to comply with the sulfur dioxide
standards  without  extensive  modifications.  Any  required  reductions  at the
Minnesota  generating  facilities are expected to be achieved through the use of
lower sulfur  coal.  Square Butte  anticipates  meeting any required  reductions
through increased use of existing scrubbers.
         The  Clean  Air  Act  requires  the  EPA  to  set  the  nitrogen  oxide
limitations  by  January  1,  1997,  for  Phase  II  generating  units.  To meet
anticipated Phase II nitrogen oxide limitations,  the Company expects to install
at its plants any  necessary  low-nitrogen  oxide burner  technology by the year
2000.  The total cost of  compliance  with the nitrogen  oxide  limitations  for
Boswell and Laskin is currently estimated to be $9 to $11 million.  The costs of
complying  with the nitrogen  oxide  limitations at Hibbard and Square Butte are
not determinable  until regulations  applicable to these plants are promulgated
by the EPA.
         The Company is participating in a voluntary program (Climate Challenge)
with the U.S.  Department of Energy to identify  activities that the Company has
taken and  additional  measures  that the Company may  undertake  on a voluntary
basis  that  will  result  in  limitations,   reductions  or  sequestrations  of
greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. Section 1605 of the Energy Policy Act
mandates  timely  and  acceptable   definitions  of  greenhouse  gas  accounting
guidelines and greenhouse  gas crediting  guidelines.  The Company has agreed to
participate  in this  voluntary  program  provided  that such  participation  is
consistent with the Company's  integrated  resource planning  process,  does not
have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  competitive  position  with
respect to rates and costs,  and  continues to be  acceptable  to the  Company's
regulators.

         The  costs  to  Minnesota  Power  associated  with  Climate   Challenge
participation are minor, reflecting program facilitation and voluntary reporting
costs.  Minnesota  Power  project  activities  to  reduce,  sequester  or offset
greenhouse  gas emissions  were selected  because they were  financially  sound.
Additional  funds were not  required to achieve  greenhouse  gas offsets  beyond
those   required  to  facilitate   projects   which  were  justified  for  other
applications.

         Water

         The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA),  as amended by
the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987,  established  the
National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System (NPDES) permit program.  The
FWPCA requires that NPDES permits be obtained from the EPA (or, when  delegated,
from individual state pollution control agencies) for any wastewater  discharged
into navigable  waters.  The Company has obtained all necessary NPDES permits to
conduct its electric operations.

* On October 2, 1995, a renewal  application of this permit was submitted to the
MPCA.  A new  permit is  expected  to be issued in the  second  quarter of 1996.
Permits are extended by the timely filing of a renewal  application  which stays
the expiration of the previously issued permit.

         The Company holds from the FERC licenses  authorizing the ownership and
operation of seven  hydroelectric  generating  projects with a total  generating
capacity of 121 MW. In 1991 the Company submitted  applications for new licenses
for four of the  projects.  By  orders  issued  in 1993,  the FERC  granted  new
licenses with terms of 30 years each, expiring December 31, 2023, for the Little
Falls (4.7 MW), Sylvan (1.8 MW), and Prairie River (1.1 MW) projects.
         On July 13, 1995, the FERC issued to the Company a 30-year  license for
the St. Louis River  hydroelectric  project (87.6 MW), with an effective date of
July 1, 1995.  The Company filed a request for rehearing of the FERC's order for
the purpose of challenging certain terms and conditions of the license which, if
accepted by the Company,  would alter the Company's operation of the project. In
addition to the Company's  request for  rehearing,  certain  intervenors  in the
relicensing proceeding filed requests for rehearing for the purpose of obtaining
other changes to the terms and  conditions of the license  which,  if granted by
the FERC,  could  result in further  changes in the  Company's  operation of the
project. Currently, the FERC is reviewing the requests for rehearing.
         An  application  to relicense  the Pillager  project (1.5 MW) was filed
with  the  FERC  on  May  11,  1995.  The  FERC  will  perform  an  engineering,
environmental  and economic  analysis of that  application in order to determine
whether to issue a new license  for the  project.  The  current  license for the
project expires on May 11, 1997. Should the FERC not reach a final determination
to issue a new  license by that date,  the  Company  expects  that the FERC will
issue an annual  license  allowing  for the  continued  operation of the project
until the FERC issues an order disposing of the application.

                                      -13-

         The two remaining hydroelectric projects,  Blanchard (18 MW) and Winton
(4 MW) have FERC licenses that expire in 2003.

         Solid Waste

         The  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act of 1976  regulates  the
management and disposal of solid wastes.  As a result of this  legislation,  the
EPA has promulgated  various  hazardous waste rules.  The Company is required to
notify the EPA of hazardous  waste activity and routinely  submits the necessary
annual reports to the EPA.
         In response to EPA Region V's request for utilities to  participate  in
their Great Lakes Initiative by voluntarily  removing remaining  polychlorinated
biphenyl   (PCB)   inventories,   the  Company  is  scheduling   replacement  of
PCB-contaminated  oil  from  substation  equipment  by 1998 and  removal  of PCB
capacitors by 2004. The total cost is expected to be between $1.5 and $2 million
of which $200,000 was expended through December 31, 1995. The Company expects to
expend about $70,000 in 1996.
         In 1990 the  Company  was  notified by the EPA and the MPCA that it had
been  named  as  a  potentially   responsible   party  under  the  Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act pertaining to the cleanup
of pollution at a northern Minnesota oil refinery site (Arrowhead Site). In 1994
a settlement  was reached  regarding  cleanup at the Arrowhead  Site.  The total
costs to remediate  the Arrowhead  Site are currently  estimated at $37 million.
Funding under the proposal is shared by several governmental  entities and about
130 companies.  Under the terms of the  settlement,  Minnesota  Power's share of
remediation costs is approximately  $314,000,  which has been paid. In addition,
the  Company  has  spent  about  $600,000  to date on  legal  and  other  costs.
Remediation  efforts  began in 1995 and will  continue  in 1996 with no expected
increase in costs.

         Mining Control and Reclamation

         BNI Coal's mining operations are governed by the Federal Surface Mining
Control  and  Reclamation  Act of 1977.  This Act,  together  with the rules and
regulations  adopted  thereunder by the  Department  of the Interior,  Office of
Surface  Mining  Reclamation  and  Enforcement  (OSM),  governs the  approval or
disapproval of all mining permits on federally owned land and the actions of the
OSM in approving or disapproving  state regulatory  programs  regulating  mining
activities.  The North Dakota Reclamation of Strip Mined Lands Act and rules and
regulations  enacted  thereunder in 1969, as  subsequently  amended by the North
Dakota Mining and Reclamation Act and rules and regulations  enacted  thereunder
in 1977,  govern the  reclamation  of surface  mined lands and are  generally as
stringent or more stringent than the federal rules and  regulations.  Compliance
is monitored  by the North Dakota  Public  Service  Commission.  The federal and
state laws and  regulations  require a wide range of procedures  including water
management,  topsoil and subsoil segregation,  stockpiling and revegetation, and
the posting of performance bonds to assure  compliance.  In general,  these laws
and  regulations  require the reclaiming of mined lands to a level of usefulness
equal to or greater  than that  available  before  active  mining.  The  Company
considers  BNI Coal to be in  substantial  compliance  with those  environmental
regulations  currently  applicable to its  operations and believes all necessary
permits to conduct such operations have been obtained.

                                Water Operations

         Water operations include SSU and Heater, both wholly owned subsidiaries
of the Company.  These water operations have been upgrading existing facilities,
building new facilities and acquiring new systems.

         -    SSU owns and operates water and wastewater  treatment  facilities
              in Florida.  SSU is the largest private water supplier in Florida.
              As of December 31, 1995,  SSU served  117,000 water  customers and
              53,000 wastewater treatment customers.
               
              In 1995 SSU acquired the assets of Orange Osceola Utilities, Inc.
              located near Kissimmee, Florida, for $13 million. The 17,000 water
              and wastewater  customers  acquired in this transaction offset the
              15,000  customers lost with the sale of Venice  Gardens' assets in
              December 1994.

         -    Heater owns and operates four  companies  which provide water and
              wastewater   treatment   services  in  North  Carolina  and  South
              Carolina.  As of December 31, 1995,  these companies served 26,000
              water customers and 3,000 wastewater treatment customers.
             
              In  January  1995 the town of  Seabrook  Island,  South  Carolina
              initiated  an  eminent  domain  action to  acquire  the  assets of
              Heater's wholly owned subsidiary, Heater of Seabrook (Seabrook). A
              tentative  agreement  has been  reached  to sell the assets to the
              town for $5.9 million.  Seabrook currently serves 3,000 customers.

Regulatory Issues

         Florida Public Service Commission

         The following  summarizes  current rate  proceedings  with the FPSC and
county commissions.

         -    On August 2, 1995, the FPSC accepted SSU's June 1995 filing which
              requested  an $18.1  million,  or 39 percent,  annual  increase in
              water and  wastewater  treatment  rates.  On November 1, 1995, the
              FPSC denied SSU's  original  $12 million  interim rate request for
              two reasons:  (1) it was based on uniform  rates which were deemed
              improper  by a court order  issued  subsequent  to SSU's  original
              filing,  and (2) the  FPSC  had not yet  formulated  a  policy  on
              allowable   investments   and   expenses   to  be  included  in  a
              forward-looking   interim  test  year.  SSU  submitted  additional
              information to support  interim rate approval of $12 million based
              on a  forward-looking  test  year  and  $8.4  million  based  on a
              historical  test year. On January 4, 1996,  the FPSC permitted SSU
              to implement an interim rate increase  (based on a historical test
              year)  of $7.9  million,  on an  annualized  basis,  over  revenue
              previously collected under a uniform rate structure. Interim rates
              went into effect on January 23, 1996. Hearings with respect to the
              $18.1 million  request are  anticipated to take place beginning in
              April 1996 and final rates are anticipated to become  effective in
              the fourth quarter of 1996. 

              The primary  reasons for  seeking  higher  rates are to include in
              rate base for earning purposes (1) new facilities added since 1991
              and (2) mandated  regulatory  compliance cost increases during the
              same period, particularly for environmental protection. The filing
              also  includes  water  conservation  incentives  and a request for
              approval   of  a   consistent   policy  on  charges   for  service
              availability.  
                                      -15-
<PAGE>

         -    In connection with SSU's 1992 consolidated  rate filing,  the FPSC
              issued an order  (Uniform  Rates  Order) in March  1993  requiring
              statewide  uniform  rates for 90 water and 37  wastewater  service
              areas.  In September 1993 rates were  implemented  pursuant to the
              Uniform Rates Order which increased SSU's revenue by $6.7 million.

              In October  1993  Citrus  County,  Florida  and a  customer  group
              appealed the FPSC's Uniform Rates Order,  challenging  the uniform
              statewide rate structure. With "uniform rates," all customers in a
              uniform  rate area pay the same  rates  for  water and  wastewater
              services.  Uniform rates are an alternative to "stand-alone" rates
              which are  calculated  based on the cost of serving  each  service
              area.

              In April 1995 the Florida First District Court of Appeals reversed
              the Uniform  Rates Order and, in October 1995 the FPSC ordered SSU
              to refund about $10 million (Refund Order), including interest, to
              customers  who had paid more since  September  1993 under  uniform
              rates than they would have paid under stand-alone rates. Under the
              Refund Order, the collection of the $10 million from customers who
              paid less under uniform rates would not be permitted.
              
              Responding to a Florida  Supreme  Court  decision  addressing  the
              issue of  retroactive  ratemaking  and  principles  of equity with
              respect to another  utility  company,  on March 5, 1996,  the FPSC
              voted to  reconsider  the  Refund  Order at an  unspecified  date.
              Briefs on the reconsideration are due April 1, 1996. SSU continues
              to  believe  that it  would  be  improper  for the FPSC to order a
              refund to one group of customers without permitting  recovery of a
              similar  amount  from the  remaining  customers  since  the  First
              District Court of Appeals affirmed SSU's total revenue requirement
              for  operations  in  Florida.  No  provision  for  refund has been
              recorded.

              In  September  1993 the FPSC  initiated  a  separate  but  related
              proceeding  for the  purpose  of  determining  if,  as a matter of
              policy,  uniform  statewide  rates  are  appropriate  for SSU.  In
              September  1994 the FPSC issued an order  declaring  that  uniform
              statewide rates represent good public policy.

         -    In June  1994  the  FPSC  issued  an  order  declining  to issue a
              declaratory   statement   which  would  have   acknowledged   FPSC
              jurisdiction  over  SSU  service  areas in  Hillsborough  and Polk
              Counties. Instead the FPSC opened an investigation to determine if
              SSU is a single system pursuant to Florida statutes.  In June 1995
              the  FPSC  voted  to  assume   jurisdiction  over  SSU  facilities
              statewide and thus to regard SSU as a single system rather than as
              a  utility  made up of more  than 150  systems.  Several  counties
              appealed this decision to the Florida District Court of Appeals.

         -    In April 1994 the Hernando  County  Board of County  Commissioners
              issued an order  rescinding FPSC  jurisdiction in Hernando County.
              In June 1994 the FPSC issued an order  acknowledging that Hernando
              County has jurisdiction over privately-owned  water and wastewater
              facilities  located in the  County as of April 5,  1994.  In April
              1994 SSU filed a court action before the Florida Circuit Court for
              Hernando County to stay the change in jurisdiction.  In April 1995
              the Hernando County Board of County  Commissioners issued an order
              which, among other things, purported to require SSU to file a rate
              proceeding  with  Hernando  County in June 1995.  SSU  amended its
              complaint  in the  Hernando  County Court to include a request for
              stay of this County action. This court action is pending.

              In April  1994  SSU also  requested  the  FPSC to  retain  interim
              jurisdiction  over  SSU's  facilities  in  Hernando  County  until
              jurisdictional determinations are made by the courts. In June 1994
              the FPSC issued an order denying SSU's request.  SSU 

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
              appealed this order to Florida's  First District Court of Appeals.
              The Court of Appeals affirmed the FPSC's action. SSU believes that
              a jurisdictional change should not be made at this time because of
              the FPSC  determination  that  SSU's  facilities  in all  counties
              within  Florida  constitute  a single  system  subject to the sole
              jurisdiction  of the FPSC. As indicated  above,  several  counties
              appealed  this  determination  to  the  First  District  Court  of
              Appeals.

         -    In March 1996 the  Collier  County  Board of County  Commissioners
              passed a  resolution  and  adopted an  ordinance  rescinding  FPSC
              jurisdiction  in Collier  County.  SSU's  position is that Collier
              County cannot  regulate  SSU's  facilities in Collier  County as a
              result of the FPSC's "single system"  determination.  As indicated
              above,  several counties,  including Collier County, have appealed
              the FPSC's determination to the First District Court of Appeals.

         South Carolina Public Service Commission

         The following  summarizes  Heater's  current rate  proceedings with the
         SCPSC.

         -    In October 1994 residents of Seabrook Island, South Carolina voted
              to allow the town to purchase or acquire  through  eminent  domain
              powers  the  town's   current  water  and   wastewater   treatment
              facilities  owned by  Seabrook.  Seabrook  currently  serves 3,000
              customers.  In January 1995 the town of Seabrook Island  initiated
              an eminent  domain  action to acquire the assets of  Seabrook.  In
              February  1995,  Seabrook  filed actions in South  Carolina  state
              court and federal court, challenging the town of Seabrook Island's
              authority to acquire  these  systems by eminent  domain.  In March
              1996 a tentative  agreement  was reached to sell the assets to the
              town for $5.9 million.  This sale is subject to  negotiation  of a
              definitive purchase agreement and regulatory approval.

         -    In July 1994 Upstate Heater  Utilities  (Upstate),  a wholly owned
              subsidiary  of Heater,  filed a request for a $71,000  annual rate
              increase  with the SCPSC.  In December  1994 the SCPSC  denied the
              request  for an annual  rate  increase  primarily  due to customer
              opposition.  In January 1995 Upstate filed for reconsideration and
              the SCPSC denied the request.  In February  1995 Upstate  filed an
              appeal in the Circuit  Court of South  Carolina.  In July 1995 the
              Circuit  Court of South  Carolina  issued  an order  vacating  the
              SCPSC's December 1994 order which denied Upstate's  request for an
              annual rate  increase.  The case was remanded to the SCPSC for the
              establishment of rates which are fair and reasonable. In September
              1995,  the SCPSC  issued a second  final order  granting an annual
              increase  of $8,000.  A motion for  reconsideration  was filed and
              denied in October  1995. An appeal by Upstate to the Circuit Court
              of South  Carolina was filed in November 1995. In January 1996 the
              requested  rates were  implemented  under  surety bond pending the
              final decision of this appeal. The final decision of the appeal is
              expected in 1997.

         -    In January  1994  Seabrook  filed  with the SCPSC a request  for a
              $263,000  annual rate increase for operations at Seabrook  Island,
              South  Carolina.  In July  1994  the  SCPSC  denied  the  request.
              Seabrook  filed  a  motion  for   reconsideration   in  July  1994
              maintaining  that the resulting  3.98 percent return on equity was
              inadequate.  In August 1994 the SCPSC denied  reconsideration.  In
              September  1994  Seabrook  filed an appeal in the Circuit Court of
              South Carolina and  subsequently  provided notice to the customers
              and  implemented  the requested rates under surety bond in January
              1995,  pending the final decision on the appeal.  In July 1995 the
              Circuit  Court of South  Carolina  issued an order  affirming  the
              SCPSC's  July 1994 order which  denied

              Seabrook's  request for an annual rate increase.  An appeal to the
              South  Carolina  Supreme  Court was filed in October 1995. A final
              decision on the appeal is expected in 1997.

         -    In July 1992 Heater  filed with the SCPSC a request for a $233,000
              rate increase for operations  near Columbia,  South  Carolina.  In
              January 1993 the SCPSC denied the rate increase request.  In March
              1993  Heater  filed with the  Circuit  Court of South  Carolina an
              appeal of the SCPSC's denial of the request. In September 1993 the
              requested rates were implemented,  under surety bond,  pending the
              decision on the appeal.  As a  condition  to the SCPSC's  grant to
              Heater of a  $110,000  annual  increase  in May 1994,  Heater  was
              required to cease charging the increased  rates under surety bond.
              In  October  1995 this case was heard  before  the South  Carolina
              Supreme Court. In December 1995 the South Carolina  Supreme Court
              issued an order  reversing the SCPSC's  January 1993 order,  which
              denied Heater's request for an annual rate increase.  The case was
              remanded to the SCPSC for  proceedings  consistent  with the court
              opinion.

              In January 1996 the SCPSC  ordered  that a 9.28 percent  operating
              margin was  appropriate  for Heater during the period in which the
              requested  rates were charged under surety bond.  The 9.28 percent
              operating  margin equated to a total refund of $54,000,  including
              interest, which was refunded to customers in February 1996.

         North Carolina Utilities Commission

         The following  summarizes  Heater's  current rate  proceedings with the
NCUC.

         -    In  August  1995  Heater  filed  with the NCUC for  approval  of a
              surcharge   that  would  allow  Heater  to  recover   $297,000  in
              additional  testing  costs  required by the EPA in excess of costs
              included  in  the  current  rate  structure.   A  final  order  is
              anticipated in April 1996.

         -    In  March  1995  Brookwood  Water  Corporation,   a  wholly  owned
              subsidiary  of Heater,  filed with the NCUC for a $120,000  annual
              rate increase.  In October 1995 a final order was issued  granting
              an $85,000 annual increase.

         -    In February 1995 Heater filed for a $314,000  annual rate increase
              with the NCUC. In December 1995 a final order was issued  granting
              a $308,000 annual increase.

Capital Expenditure Program

         Capital  expenditures  for the water  operations  totaled  $34  million
during 1995.  Expenditures  were funded with the proceeds from  long-term  bonds
issued by SSU and  internally  generated  funds.  Capital  expenditures  for the
Company's water  operations are expected to be $25 million in 1996 for upgrades,
water reuse projects and new water  facilities,  and to total  approximately $90
million during the period 1997 through 2000.

Competition

         The regulated water and wastewater  services industry is experiencing a
series   of   transformations   including   privatization,   consolidation   and
regionalization.  These new trends are a direct result of expanded environmental
regulations  and  increasingly  limited  water  supply and  wastewater  disposal
options. Consequently,  growth in the industry will be realized by those service
providers who make adequate capital investment to achieve these transformations.

                                      -18-
<PAGE>
Since economic  regulation has not kept pace with the investment  demands placed
on  private  utilities,  regulatory  lag has  delayed  the  recovery  of private
utilities' service costs.
         Historically, competition and change have been minimal in the water and
wastewater industry.  During the next five years,  however, the Company believes
that the  water  and  wastewater  industry  will  become  more  competitive  and
innovation-driven.  The Company is focused on the  application  of technology to
reduce  costs and  increase  efficiency,  objectives  that are  critical  in the
competitive pursuit of regulated, as well as unregulated, markets.

Franchises

         SSU provides  water and  wastewater  treatment  services in 22 counties
regulated  by the FPSC,  holds  franchises  in two  counties  which to date have
retained   authority  to  regulate  such  operations,   and  is  contesting  the
jurisdiction  of two other  counties over SSU  facilities in light of the FPSC's
"single system"  determination.  (See Regulatory Issues - Florida Public Service
Commission.)
         All of the  water  and  wastewater  services  of  Heater  are under the
jurisdiction of the SCPSC and the NCUC. These  commissions  grant franchises for
Heater's service territory when the rates are authorized.

Environmental Matters

         The  Company's  water  operations  are subject to regulation by various
federal,  state  and local  authorities  in the  areas of water  quality,  solid
wastes,  and  other  environmental  matters.  The  Company  considers  its water
operations to generally be in compliance  with those  environmental  regulations
currently applicable to its operations and have the permits necessary to conduct
such  operations.  Except  as  noted  below,  the  Company  does  not  currently
anticipate that its potential  capital  expenditures for  environmental  matters
will be  material.  However,  because  environmental  laws and  regulations  are
constantly  evolving,  the character,  scope and ultimate costs of environmental
compliance cannot be estimated.
         In  October  1992  the EPA  issued a  Request  for  Information  to SSU
regarding  operations of SSU's facilities in the University  Shores service area
in  Orange  County,  Florida.  The  request  was  made to  obtain  more  details
concerning  exceedances of the NPDES permit for effluent quality.  The requested
information  was compiled and sent to the EPA in late 1992 and  supplemented  in
February  1993. In February 1993 the EPA issued a Notice to Show Cause letter to
request SSU  representatives  to meet and discuss the exceedances.  SSU met with
the EPA in March 1993 and received an additional  Request for  Information  from
the EPA in April 1993. The requested information was supplied to the EPA in June
1993.  At that time,  SSU was  attempting  to  determine  a  feasible  method to
eliminate  surface water discharges  allowed by the NPDES permit.  SSU signed an
agreement  with Orange  County  Utilities  (OCU) to  construct  an  interconnect
between  the two  collection  systems so that a portion  of the  sewage  flow at
University  Shores  facilities  could be sent to OCU.  The  construction  of the
interconnect  was completed in September 1994 thereby  allowing SSU to eliminate
effluent  discharges by the  University  Shores  facilities  to surface  waters.
Additional  information on the project was requested by the EPA in November 1994
and SSU supplied the requested  information to the EPA in December 1994. SSU has
received  no further  communication  from the EPA  regarding  this matter and is
unable  to  determine  what  further  action,  if  any,  may  be  required.  The
interconnect with OCU, for a portion of the sewage flow, has alleviated the need
for  discharge  of effluent to surface  water.  The  operating  permit is in the
process of being renewed.

                                      -19-
<PAGE>
         In  September  1993  the EPA  issued  an  Administrative  Order  to SSU
regarding  operations of SSU's  facilities in the Woodmere service area in Duval
County,  Florida  (Woodmere  facilities).  The Order required  monthly  toxicity
testing of the effluent for at least one year because of toxicity  test failures
during 1992 and 1993. In September  1994,  because of  additional  1993 and 1994
toxicity   test   failures  at  the  Woodmere   facilities,   the  EPA  required
implementation  of a Toxicity  Reduction  Evaluation (TRE) plan to determine the
cause of the toxicity. The TRE plan was expected to take approximately 15 months
to  complete.  In 1995 SSU  determined  that the  toxicity  test  failures  were
presumably  due to  inappropriate  salt water test species.  A request was filed
with the EPA in  February  1995 to change  testing  requirements  to fresh water
species  for  consistency  with  the FDEP  wastewater  permit  for the  Woodmere
facilities,  since the body of water  affected is a fresh  water body.  A permit
renewal  application  was  filed  with  the FDEP in  November  1995,  since  the
permitting  authority was delegated by the EPA to the FDEP in May 1995. The FDEP
has responded  with a request for some  additional  information  to complete the
application.  The  requested  information  was forwarded to the FDEP in February
1996.  SSU  representatives  met  with the  FDEP in  February  1996 and the FDEP
indicated a  willingness  to issue a permit with fresh water test species as the
requirement.  This permit  modification is expected to be included in the permit
renewal.  The EPA has retained the authority over the pending enforcement action
concerning this system.  SSU is unable to determine what further action, if any,
may be required.
         In March 1995 the Administrative  Order issued in August 1994 for SSU's
facilities  in the  Beacon  Hills  service  area in Duval  County,  Florida  was
satisfied after additional bioassay testing conducted between September 1994 and
February  1995 met EPA  requirements.  SSU will also petition the FDEP to change
test species at Beacon Hills from salt to fresh water  species as requested  for
the Woodmere facilities. The Administrative Order has officially been closed and
SSU will submit a request to the FDEP to change testing  requirements during the
permit renewal process.
         In 1995 SSU invested  approximately  $11.1  million of a $28.7  million
annual capital  expenditure  budget (or  approximately 39 percent) in facilities
necessary to comply with  environmental  requirements.  In 1996 SSU expects that
approximately  $9.6  million of the $19.5  million  annual  capital  expenditure
budget  (or   approximately  49  percent)  will  be  necessary  to  comply  with
environmental requirements.

                               Automobile Auctions

         Minnesota  Power has an 83 percent  ownership  interest  in ADESA,  the
third  largest  automobile  auction  business  in  the  United  States.   ADESA,
headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, owns and operates 19 automobile auctions
in the United States and Canada  through which used cars and other  vehicles are
sold to franchised  automobile dealers and licensed used car dealers. Two wholly
owned  subsidiaries  of  ADESA,   Automotive  Finance  Company  and  ADESA  Auto
Transport,  perform  related  services.  Sellers  at  ADESA's  auctions  include
domestic and foreign auto  manufacturers,  car dealers,  fleet/lease  companies,
banks and finance companies.
         The  Company  acquired  80 percent  of ADESA on July 1, 1995,  for $167
million in cash. Proceeds from the sale of the Company's paper and pulp business
combined with proceeds from the sale of securities investments were used to fund
this acquisition.  Acquired goodwill and other intangible assets associated with
this  acquisition  are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods not
exceeding  40 years.  In January  1996 the Company  provided an  additional  $15
million of capital in exchange for 1,982,346  original issue common stock shares
of ADESA. This capital  contribution  increased the Company's ownership interest
in ADESA to 

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
83 percent.  Put and call  agreements  with ADESA's four top executives  provide
ADESA  management the right to sell to Minnesota  Power, and Minnesota Power the
right to purchase,  ADESA management's 17 percent retained ownership interest in
ADESA,  in increments  during the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, at a price based on
ADESA's financial performance.

Capital Expenditure Program

         Capital   expenditures  for  automobile  auction  site  relocation  and
development were $43 million for the six months ended December 31, 1995. Capital
expenditures for the automobile  auction business are expected to be $28 million
in 1996. In September 1995 ADESA opened the world's  largest  indoor  automobile
auction facility in Framingham,  Massachusetts.  Expansion projects at Manville,
New Jersey and Jacksonville,  Florida and a relocation  project in Indianapolis,
Indiana began operations in the first quarter of 1996.

Competition

         Within the automobile auction industry,  ADESA's  competition  includes
independently  owned  auctions  as well as major  chains and  associations  with
auctions in geographic  proximity to those of ADESA.  ADESA  competes with other
auctions  for a supply of  automobiles  to be sold by ADESA on  consignment  for
automobile  dealers,  financial  institutions  and  other  sellers.  ADESA  also
competes  for  a  supply  of  rental   repurchase   vehicles   from   automobile
manufacturers for auctions at factory sales. ADESA competes for these sellers of
automobiles  by  attempting  to attract a large  number of  dealers to  purchase
vehicles,  which ensures  competitive prices and supports the volume of vehicles
auctioned,  and by  providing  a full  range  of  services  including  floorplan
financing,  reconditioning  services  which  prepare  automobiles  for  auction,
transporting automobiles and the prompt processing of sale transactions.
         Auto auction sales for the industry are expected to rise at a rate of 6
percent to 8 percent  annually.  ADESA expects to participate in this industry's
growth through acquisitions, greenfield start-ups and expanded services.

Environmental Matters

         The Company's  automobile  auction business is subject to regulation by
various federal,  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water
quality,  solid wastes, and other environmental  matters.  The Company considers
operations  of  this  business  to  be  in  substantial  compliance  with  those
environmental  regulations  currently  applicable to its operations and believes
all necessary permits to conduct such operations have been obtained. The Company
does not  currently  anticipate  that its  potential  capital  expenditures  for
environmental matters will be material.  However, because environmental laws and
regulations are constantly evolving, the character,  scope and ultimate costs of
environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

                                   Investments

         The  Investments  segment  is  comprised  of  real  estate  operations,
financial guaranty reinsurance and a portfolio of securities. The Company ceased
operations at Reach All, the truck-mounted lifting equipment business,  and sold
Reach All's assets in 1995.
               
         -    Real Estate Operations.  The Company owns 80 percent of Lehigh, a
              Florida real estate company.  Lehigh currently owns 4,000 acres of
              land and  approximately  8,000 homesites near Fort Myers,  Florida
              and 1,250  homesites in Citrus  County,  Florida.  The real estate
              strategy is to acquire large residential  community  properties at
              low cost, adding value, and selling them at going market prices.

         -    Reinsurance.  Minnesota Power has a 21 percent equity  investment
              in Capital Re. Capital Re is a Delaware  holding  company  engaged
              primarily in financial and mortgage guaranty  reinsurance  through
              its wholly owned  subsidiaries,  Capital  Reinsurance  Company and
              Capital Mortgage Reinsurance Company.  Capital Reinsurance Company
              is  a  reinsurer  of  financial   guarantees   of  municipal   and
              non-municipal  debt  obligations.   Capital  Mortgage  Reinsurance
              Company is a reinsurer of residential mortgage guaranty insurance.
              The  Company's  equity  investment  in Capital Re at December  31,
              1995, was $93 million.

         -    Securities  Portfolio.   Minnesota  Power  manages  a  securities
              portfolio  which is  intended to provide  funds for  reinvestment,
              business  acquisitions and other corporate  purposes.  The Company
              plans to continue to concentrate on market neutral strategies that
              provide stable and acceptable  returns without  sacrificing needed
              liquidity.  Returns  will  continue to be  partially  dependent on
              general  market  yields.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company had
              approximately $106 million invested in the securities portfolio.

Environmental Matters

         Certain businesses  included in the Company's  investments  segment are
subject to regulation by various  federal,  state and local  authorities  in the
areas of air quality,  water  quality,  solid  wastes,  and other  environmental
matters. The Company considers these businesses to be in substantial  compliance
with those environmental  regulations currently applicable to its operations and
believes all necessary  permits to conduct such  operations  have been obtained.
The  Company  does  not  currently   anticipate   that  its  potential   capital
expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be  material.  However,  because
environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, the character, scope
and ultimate costs of environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder 
        Matters.

         The Company has paid dividends without interruption on its common stock
since 1948. A quarterly  dividend of $.51 per share on the common stock was paid
on March 1, 1996,  to the holders of record on February 15, 1996.  The Company's
common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange.  Dividends paid per share
and the high and low  prices  for the  Company's  common  stock for the  periods
indicated  as reported  by The Wall Street  Journal,  Midwest  Edition,  were as
follows:

                                                              Dividends

        - Third             28 1/8       26 3/8             .51
        - Fourth            29 1/4       27 1/2             .51        $2.04

 1994   - First           $ 33         $ 28               $ .505
        - Second            30 1/8       25                 .505
        - Third             28 1/8       25                 .505
        - Fourth            26 5/8       24 3/4             .505       $2.02

         The amount  and timing of  dividends  payable on the  Company's  common
stock are within the sole  discretion  of the Company's  Board of Directors.  In
1995 the Company  paid out 94 percent of its per share  earnings  in  dividends.
Over the longer term, the Company's goal is to reduce dividend payout to between
75  percent  and 80  percent  of per  share  earnings.  This is  expected  to be
accomplished by increasing earnings rather than reducing dividends.

         The Company's Articles of Incorporation, Mortgage and Deed of Trust and
preferred  stock  purchase  agreements  contain  provisions  which under certain
circumstances  would  restrict  the  payment of common  stock  dividends.  As of
December 31, 1995,  no retained  earnings  were  restricted as a result of these
provisions.  At March 1, 1996,  there were 25,975 common stock  shareholders  of

                         Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
ADESA Corporation

We have audited the  consolidated  balance  sheet of ADESA  Corporation,  an 80%
owned  subsidiary of Minnesota  Power & Light Company (MPL),  as of December 31,
1995, and the related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity,
and cash flows for the period from July 1, 1995 (date of  acquisition by MPL) to
December 31, 1995 (not presented separately herein).  These financial statements
are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects,  the consolidated  financial position of ADESA
Corporation at December 31, 1995, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for the period from July 1, 1995 to  December  31,  1995,  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                        Report of Independent Accountants
                         on Financial Statement Schedule


To the Board of Directors
   of Minnesota Power

         Our audits of the consolidated  financial statements referred to in our
report dated January 22, 1996, appearing on page 21 of the 1995 Annual Report to
Shareholders  of  Minnesota  Power  (which  report  and  consolidated  financial
statements  are  incorporated  by reference in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K)
also included an audit of the Financial  Statement Schedule listed in Item 14(a)
of this Form 10-K. In our opinion,  the Financial  Statement  Schedule  presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. We did not audit
the Financial Statements of ADESA Corporation,  an 80% owned subsidiary acquired
July 1, 1995, which statements reflect an allowance for estimated  uncollectible
trade accounts receivable of $2,418,000 at December 31, 1995 and a provision for
bad debts of $2,353,000  charged to income for the six months then ended.  Those
statements  were  audited  by  other  auditors  whose  report  thereon  has been
furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein,  insofar as it relates to the
amounts  included  for ADESA  Corporation,  is based solely on the report of the
other auditors.

                    MINNESOTA POWER AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES
                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN
                            (As Amended and Restated
                            Effective August 1, 1994)



                      SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

         1.1  Establishment  of  Plan.  MINNESOTA  POWER  & LIGHT  COMPANY  (the
"Company" and also sometimes  "Minnesota  Power")  established,  effective as of
July 1, 1980, a  Supplemental  Retirement  Plan for eligible  executives  of the
Company,  such Plan to be known as the  SUPPLEMENTAL  EXECUTIVE  RETIREMENT PLAN
(THE "PLAN").  The Plan was established in order to provide supplemental current
or retirement  benefits  payable as provided  hereafter  solely from the general
assets of the Company. The Plan is intended to be exempt from the participation,
vesting,  funding,  and  fiduciary  requirements  of  Title  1 of  the  Employee
Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974.  Effective as of January 1, 1981,  the
Plan was amended to include compensation attributable to the Company's Incentive
Compensation  Plan in  determining  benefits  under this Plan.  Effective  as of
January 1, 1982,  the plan was  amended to change the manner in which  Incentive
Awards are accounted for when  determining  benefits payable at retirement under
Section  4.1.  Effective  December  1, 1982,  the Plan was amended to change the
deferral and cash payment  options of the Plan.  The Plan was amended  including
revisions through and including May 10, 1983, and restated in its entirety as of
January 1, 1983. The revisions included a provision to provide benefits that are
above the limitations under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Effective
January 1, 1984,  the Plan was amended to provide for a  predetermined  interest
rate of 10.5% to be used in  determining  the value of  certain  benefits  under
Subsection 4.1(b) (1). Effective January 1, 1987 the Plan was amended to provide
for two additional  investment choices for monies deferred under the Plan and to
make other minor  changes to the Plan.  Effective  August 1, 1987,  the Plan has
been  amended to provide for a fixed rate of return of 8% under  Section  4.4(a)
for  deferral  elections  made after that date  rather than a return that is the
greater of 10.5% or the Company's actual overall  percentage  return on capital,
and to make a minor change in

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

the Plan name. Effective May 1, 1988 the Plan was amended so that benefits under
Subsection 4.1(c) and (d) are available only to active participants who were age
60 or older as of said  date.  Effective  November  1,  1988,  the Plan has been
amended to make revisions in certain discretions available to the Company and to
eligible  participants.  Effective January 1, 1990, the Plan has been amended to
remove  participant choice with respect to the payment of benefits under section
4.1(b).  The Plan has also been amended to eliminate  the make-up of the 2% CORE
benefits,  which  were  eliminated  under the  Supplemental  Retirement  Plan to
account for the Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan, and to provide for a make-up of
the Employee Stock Ownership Plan Partnership  account allocation  contribution.
Effective  August 1, 1992,  the Plan was  amended to change the date  retirement
benefits  are due and payable from the last day of the month to the first day of
the month.  Effective  March 1, 1994,  the Plan was  amended  to  calculate  the
monthly  benefit  provided under Section  4.1(b) using a final average  earnings
calculation   which  combines  Results  Sharing  with  Incentive   Compensation.
Effective  August 1, 1994,  the Plan was  amended at Section 3.1  eliminate  the
eligibility  option of annual  compensation  in  excess  of  $100,000,  to allow
voluntary deferrals up to 15% of annual salary less deferrals allowable pursuant
to the Supplemental  Retirement Plan, to provide for a present value calculation
at Section 4.1(d) using the interest  assumption used for funding purposes under
the Minnesota  Power and Affiliated  Companies  Employees  Retirement Plan A, to
change options for measuring indexes for monies deferred under the Plan provided
in Section 4.5, and to make other minor administrative changes.

         1.2  Purpose  of the Plan.  It is the  purpose  of this Plan to provide
eligible  executives  with benefits that will  compensate  them for  limitations
which  apply  to the  Minnesota  Power  and  Affiliated  Companies  Supplemental
Retirement Plan (sometimes  hereinafter the "Supplemental  Retirement Plan") and
the Minnesota Power and Affiliated  Companies  Employee Stock Ownership Plan and
Trust (sometimes hereinafter the "Employee Stock Ownership Plan") and to provide
for the  inclusion  of  compensation  attributable  to the  Minnesota  Power and
Affiliated  Companies  Incentive  Compensation  Plan (sometimes  hereinafter the
"Incentive  Compensation  Plan"),  effective  January  1, 1981,  in  determining
benefits under this plan.

              Plan)  Compensation  as defined in this  subsection  shall include
              amounts received from all such companies.  Compensation  shall not
              include  amounts  which an  employee  elects to receive in cash or
              defers under this Plan, under the Supplemental  Retirement Plan or
              under  the  Flexible  Compensation  Plan  for  Nonunion  Employees

              continuation  of a  portion  of  the  retirement  benefit  to  the
              surviving spouse following the death of the retired participant in
              a manner similar to Subsection 4.1(c) or 4.2(c) of Retirement Plan
              A. The interest rate to be used in determining present worth shall

              survivor  income  benefit  is  payable  under  Subsection  4.10 of

                    Subsection 4.10(b)(2) of Retirement Plan A.

              In determining  present worth under (c) above,  the Consumer Price
              Index  used to  calculate  the  cost-of-living  adjustments  under
              Subsection  4.8 of Retirement  Plan A shall be assumed to increase
              after the  participant's  death at the same average annual rate as
              the increase in the Consumer  Price Index for the five year period
              ending  on the  later  of the  June  30th  or  the  December  31st
              immediately  preceding  death.  The  interest  rate  to be used in
              determining  present worth shall be an annual percentage rate used
              for purposes of calculating  funding necessary for Retirement Plan
              A. The probability of remarriage by the surviving  spouse shall be
              taken into account in determining present worth.

              year.

         (c)  If an  election  is not in effect  on the first day of a  calendar
              year,  that  portion of the  participant's  deferred  compensation
              amount for such calendar year shall be irrevocably  entered on the
              books of the Company as an account

              the Committee shall calculate the size of each monthly installment
              under  procedures  consistent  with those used under the Company's
              Executive  Investment Plan I and Executive  Investment Plan II. If
              payments to a participant are to be made in installments, then the
              supplemental  account  of the  participant  shall  continue  to be

              Subsection 4.3, the Company shall pay each participant the balance
              credited to the participant's supplemental account in a single sum
              during  the  calendar  year   following  the  year  in  which  the
              participant   Retires,   dies,   becomes  disabled  or  terminates
              employment.  Payment  shall  be  made  within  30 days  after  the
              calculation  of amounts  deferred under this plan is actually made
              for the  year.  Amounts  paid  shall  be  reduced  by any  amounts
              required to be withheld by state or federal law.

         4.5  Maintenance of Accounts.

         (a)  The Company  shall  establish  and  maintain,  in the name of each
              participant,   an   individual   account,   to  be  known  as  the
              supplemental  account,  which  shall be  credited  each  year with
              earnings or losses on the balance outstanding as of the end of the
              preceding year and with the amount of the annual  allocation which
              the participant does not elect to receive in cash.

              For each calendar year the Committee shall adjust the balance,  if
              any, of the participant's  supplemental account as of the last day
              of the preceding calendar year ("Accounting Date"), by multiplying
              such amount (including any deferred  compensation amounts credited
              as of such date on  account

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

              of the preceding year) by one of the  multipliers  approved by the
              Employee  Benefits   Committee,   with  participant  to  choose  a
              multiplier or multipliers  annually in advance to be effective for
              the succeeding year.

              If the participant  has made an election to transfer  supplemental
              account balances among the  aforementioned  multipliers during the
              calendar year,  such applicable  multipliers  shall be prorated to
              reflect  that  portion of the year that the  supplemental  account
              balances were invested in each  investment  fund. The  participant
              may elect to  transfer  supplemental  account  balances  among the
              aforementioned  investment  fund  multipliers  effective  for  any
              month. The  aforementioned  investment fund  multipliers  shall be
              used  only  as  a  performance  reference  for  the  participant's
              supplemental  account,  and such supplemental  account need not be
              invested in such investment funds by the Committee.

              The Committee shall then add to such supplemental account balance,
              as adjusted for earnings or losses during the year. the allocation
              of deferred compensation amounts, If any, that the participant has
              not elected to receive in cash for the calendar year.

         (b)  The supplemental  account of each participant  shall be entered on
              the books of the Company and shall represent a liability,  payable
              when  due  under  this  Plan,  out of the  general  assets  of the
              Company.  Prior to benefits  becoming due  hereunder,  the Company
              shall  expense  the  liability  for  payment of such  accounts  in
              accordance with policies  determined  appropriate by the Company's
              auditors.

         (c)  In years when deferred  compensation  elections are made available
              under the  Company's  Executive  Investment  Plans I and II,  each
              participant  shall be entitled to transfer  his or her  individual
              account as a Rollover Amount to the Minnesota Power and Affiliated
              Companies  Executive  Investment Plan I or the Minnesota Power and
              Affiliated  Companies Executive Investment Plan II, all subject to
              the specific terms and  restrictions in said Plans,  provided that
              the transfer of an individual  account as a Rollover

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

              Amount shall not result in a deferral or  acceleration of the date
              or dates on which such  Rollover  Amount would have been  received
              under the terms of this Plan had no transfer occurred.

         4.6  Payment of Amount Credited Under Section 4.1(c) Notwithstanding
the  provisions  of Section  4.3,  the amount  credited  to a  participant  upon
Retirement  under  Section  4.1(c) shall be paid in equal  monthly  installments
commencing on the last day of the month following the date of the  Participant's
Retirement and continuing for a period of 15 years.  Monthly  installments shall
be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3.

         4.7  Payment  of  Unpaid  Benefits  Upon  Participant's   Death.  If  a
participant dies while employed by the Company or if a Retired  participant dies
before  receiving  all payments  which such  participant  is entitled to receive
pursuant  to  Subsections  4.4,  4.6  or  pursuant  to an  election  made  under
Subsection  4.3  hereof,  the  amount  then  standing  to  the  credit  of  such
participant on his or her  supplemental  account shall be paid in the subsequent
calendar year following the date of the participant's death to the participant's
beneficiary.  A subsequent  payment shall be made in a single sum within 30 days
after  allocation  of amounts  payable  under this plan is actually made for the
year in which the participant's date of death occurs.

Each  participant  may designate,  by letter to the Committee,  a beneficiary to
receive any payment to be made hereunder after the death of the participant. The
designation  shall take effect upon  receipt of the letter by the  Committee.  A
participant may change his or her designated  beneficiary or beneficiaries  from
time to time and each such  letter of  designation  shall  revoke  any  previous
designation.  If no  beneficiary  has  been  designated,  or if  all  designated
beneficiaries  have  predeceased  the  participant,  the deceased  participant's
estate shall be the participant's beneficiary. If a designated beneficiary shall
survive the  participant  but all  designated  beneficiaries  shall die prior to
complete  distribution of the benefit  payable with respect to the  participant,
the deceased participant's beneficiary shall be the estate of the last surviving
designated beneficiary.

         4.8  Distribution  Upon  Termination  Other Than  Retirement,  Death or
Disability.  If a participant's  employment with the Company  terminates for any
reason other than Retirement,  death or disability, the balance to the credit of
the  participant's  supplemental  account as of the Accounting Date  immediately
preceding  or  coincident  with the  date of the  participant's  termination  of
employment,  shall be paid to the  participant  in a single sum upon the date of
the participant's  separation from service,  or within 30 days thereafter.  If a
participant  entitled to a benefit  under this  section  dies prior to receiving
payment, then such payment shall be made to the participant's beneficiary.

terminates  his or her  employment on account of  disability  (as defined in the
Supplemental Retirement Plan) prior to Retirement,  the balance to the credit of
the  participant's  supplemental  account shall be paid to the  participant in a
single sum in the year after such  termination  of employment  occurs.  Payments
shall be made within 30 days after the calculation of amounts payable under this
plan is  actually  made for the year in which  the  participant  separated  from
service on account of disability.  If a participant  entitled to a benefit under
this section dies prior to receiving payment, then such payment shall be made to
his or her beneficiary. 

                          SECTION 5. ADMINISTRATION

         5.1  Committee.  This  Plan  shall  be  administered  by the  committee
appointed by the Board of  Directors of the Company and known as the  Employees'
Benefit Plans Committee (the "Committee").

The  interpretation  and  construction by the Committee of any provisions of the
Plan  shall be final  unless  otherwise  determined  by the Board of  Directors.
Subject to the Board,  the  Committee is  authorized  to interpret  the Plan, to
prescribe,  amend and rescind rules and regulations  relating to it, and to make
all other determinations necessary for its administration.

                                  -15-
<PAGE>

Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  the Committee shall have the
authority to calculate amounts allocable to participants, to maintain and adjust
supplemental  accounts,  and to calculate the  percentage  net return on account
balances.

         5.2  Uniform Rules. In administering the Plan, the Committee will apply
uniform rules to all participants similarly situated.

         5.3  Notice of Address. Any payment to a participant or beneficiary, at
the last known post office address on file with the Company,  shall constitute a
complete  acquittance  and  discharge to the Company and any director or officer
with respect thereto unless the Company shall have received prior written notice
of any change in the address,  condition, or status of the distributee.  Neither
the Company nor any  director or officer  shall have any duty or  obligation  to
search for or ascertain the whereabouts of any participant or his beneficiary.

         5.4  Records.  The records of the  Committee  with  respect to the Plan
shall be  conclusive  on all  participants.  all  beneficiaries,  and all  other
persons whomsoever.

         5.5  Claims  Procedure.  If any  claim for  benefits  under the Plan is
wholly or  partially  denied,  the  claimant  shall be given  notice in writing,
within a reasonable  period of time after  receipt of the claim by the plan,  by
registered or certified mail, of such denial,  written in a manner calculated to
be  understood  by the  claimant,  setting  forth the specific  reasons for such
denial,  specific  reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is
based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the
claimant  to  perfect  the  claim and an  explanation  of why such  material  or
information  is  necessary,  and an  explanation  of  the  Plan's  claim  review
procedure.  The Claimant  also shall be advised  that he or his duly  authorized
representative may request a review by the Committee of the decision denying the
claim by filing  with the  Committee,  within 60 days after such notice has been
received  by the  claimant,  a written  request  for such  review,  and that the
Claimant  may review  pertinent  documents,  and submit  issues and  comments in
writing within the same 60-day period.  If such request is so filed, such review
shall be made by the Committee within 60 days after receipt of such request; and
the claimant shall be given written  notice of the decision  resulting from such
review, and shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

a manner calculated  to be understood  by the  claimant, and specific references
to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.

         5.6  Change of Law. The  Committee may make payments of any benefits or
deferred  amounts to be paid under the Plan, to any participant or participants,
or to the beneficiary of any participant or participants, in advance of the date
when  otherwise due, (i) if, based on a change in federal tax law or regulation,
published  rulings or similar  announcements  by the Internal  Revenue  Service,
decision by a court of competent  jurisdiction involving the Plan, a participant
or a beneficiary, or a closing agreement made under Section 7121 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 that involves the Plan, a participant or a beneficiary,  it
determines that a participant or beneficiary  will recognize  income for federal
income tax purposes  with respect to amounts that are otherwise not then payable
under the Plan;  or (ii) if it shall be  determined  that the Plan is subject to
the  requirements  of Parts 2 and 3 of  Subtitle  B of  Title I of the  Employee
Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974,  because  such Plan is not  maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred  compensation for a select group
of management or highly compensated employees.

         5.7  Generation-Skipping  Tax.  Notwithstanding  any provisions in this
Plan to the  contrary,  the  Committee  may withhold  any benefits  payable to a
beneficiary  as a result  of the death of the  participant  (or the death of any
beneficiary  designated by the participant) until such time as (i) the Committee
is able to determine whether a  generation-skipping  transfer tax, as defined in
Chapter 13 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  or any  substitute  provision
therefor,  is payable by the Company;  and (ii) the Committee has determined the
amount  of  generation-skipping  transfer  tax that is due,  including  interest
thereon.  If any such tax is payable,  the  Committee  shall reduce the benefits
otherwise  payable  hereunder  to such  beneficiary  by the amount  necessary to
provide  said  beneficiary  with a benefit  equal to the amounts that would have
been payable if the  original  benefits  had been  calculated  on the basis of a
value for the participant's  supplemental  account reduced by an amount equal to
the generation-skipping transfer tax and any interest thereon that is payable as
a result  of the  death in  question.  The  Committee  may  also  withhold  from
distribution by further  reduction of the then net value of benefits  calculated
in  accordance  with the terms of the  previous  sentence  such  amounts  as the
Committee feels are reasonably necessary to pay

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

additional  generation-skipping  transfer tax and interest  thereon from amounts
initially  calculated to be due. Any amounts so withheld,  and not actually paid
as a generation-skipping transfer tax or interest thereon, shall be payable as 
soon as there is a final  determination of the applicable generation-skipping 
tax and interest thereon.

         6.1  Nonassignability.  Benefits  under  the  Plan  are  not in any way

it,  that  such  person  is  incompetent  or  a  minor,  and  that  a  guardian,
conservator,  statutory committee,  or other person legally vested with the care
of his or her estate has been  appointed.  In the event that the Committee finds
that any  person  to whom a  benefit  Is  payable  under  the PIan is  unable to
properly  care for his or her  affairs,  or is a minor,  then  any  payment  due

representative)  may be paid to the spouse,  a child, a parent,  or a brother or
sister,  or to any person deemed by the  Committee to have incurred  expense for
such person otherwise entitled to payment.

In the event a guardian or conservator  or statutory  committee of the estate of
any person receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be appointed by a
court of competent  jurisdiction,  payment  shall be made to either  guardian or
conservator or statutory  committee provided that proper proof of appointment is
furnished in a form and manner suitable to the Committee. Any payment made under
the  provisions  of this  subsection  shall be complete  discharge  of liability
therefor under the Plan.

         6.3  Employment  Rights.  The  establishment  of the Plan  shall not be
construed  as  conferring  any legal  rights upon any  participant  or any other

of the Company to discharge any person and/or treat such person  without  regard
to the effect which such treatment might have upon or her as a person covered by

the terms or conditions of the Plan.

         6.5  Illegality of Particular Provision. If any particular provision of

affect the other  provisions  thereof,  but the Plan shall be  construed  in all
respects as if such invalid provision were omitted.

         6.6  Contractual Obligations. It is Intended that the Company is under 
a contractual obligation to make payments to participants from the general funds
and assets of the Company in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions  of the
Plan,  with such payments to reduce the amounts  allocated to the  participant's
account  hereunder.  A participant shall have no rights to such payments.  other

resolution  of  its  Board  of  Directors.   Provided,  however,  no  amendment,

account of a participant  on the date of such  amendment,  termination  or other
change,  which  account  balance  shall be payable to such  participant  or such
participant's beneficiary as provided herein.

         7.2  Reorganization  of  the  Company.  In the  event  of a  merger  or
consolidation of the Company, or the transfer of substantially all of the assets
of the Company to another corporation, such continuing,  resulting or transferee

Company   hereunder   without  obtaining  the  consent  of  any  participant  or
beneficiary.  If such  successor  shall  assume the  liabilities  of the Company
hereunder,  then the Company  shall be relieved  of all such  liability,  and no
participant or beneficiary  shall have the right to assert any claim against the
Company for benefits under or in connection with this Plan.

and principal Properties of the Company, the Guarantor and the Subsidiaries.

      and (ii) the  consolidated  financial  statements of the Guarantor and its
      consolidated  subsidiaries  for the six month period ending June 30, 1994.
      Such  financial  statements  have been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP
      consistently  applied,  and present fairly, in all material respects,  the
      financial  position of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as of such dates
      and the  results  of their  operations  and cash  flows  for such  periods
      (subject,  in the case of such  interim  statements,  to  normal  year end
      adjustments).  All such financial  statements  include the accounts of all
      subsidiaries  of the Guarantor for the  respective  periods during which a
      subsidiary relationship has existed.

            (b) Debt.  The  Company  has no  outstanding  Debt  except the Debt
      evidenced  by the Notes.  Part 3.2(b) of Annex 3 hereto  lists all debt of
      the Guarantor and the  Subsidiaries  as of October 31, 1994,  and provides
      the following information with respect to each item of such Debt:

                (i) the holder thereof,

                (ii) the outstanding amount,

                (iii) the portion which is classified as current under GAAP, and

                (iv) the collateral securing such Debt, if any.

            (c) Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 1993, there has been
      no change in the  business,  prospects,  profits,  Properties or condition
      (financial  or  otherwise)  of the  guarantor or any of the  Subsidiaries,
      except  changes in the ordinary  course of business that, in the aggregate
      for all such changes,  could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect.

            (d) Other  Financial  Information.  All  statements  or summaries of
      historical  or  pro  forma  financial  condition  and  performance  of the
      Company,  the  Guarantor  and the  Subsidiaries  included in the Placement
      Memorandum  or  delivered  to you  by the  Company  or the  Guarantor  are
      complete  and  correct  in all  material  respects,  and  such  pro  forma
      statements have been prepared based on assumptions and estimates which are
      set forth in the Placement Memorandum and which are reasonable in light of
      the circumstances existing at the time such assumptions and estimates were
      made,  based  on the  best  information  available  to  management  of the
      Guarantor and the  Subsidiaries  at the time of the  preparation  thereof.
      Such assumptions continue to be reasonable,  based on the best information
      available  to the  management  of  the  Company,  the  Guarantor  and  the
      Subsidiaries.

            full in the most recent  balance sheet referred to in Section 3.2(a)
            hereof; provided, however, the Guarantor has been advised by the IRS
            that its federal income tax return for the Guarantor's 1992 tax year

      of the Company or the Guarantor in connection  with this  Agreement or any
      Closing,  contain  any untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit a
      material  fact  necessary  to make the  statements  contained  therein and
      herein not misleading. There is no fact that has not been disclosed to you
      in writing that has had or, so far as the Company or the Guarantor can now
      reasonably  foresee,  could  reasonably  be  expected  to have a  Material
      Adverse Effect.

            Plan or any trust established thereunder.

      No Pension Plan, or trust created thereunder, has incurred any accumulated
      funding  deficiency  (as such term is defined  in  section  302 of ERISA),
      whether or not waived,  as of the last day of the most recently ended plan
      year of such Pension Plan.

            (c) Prohibited Transactions.

                (i) The  issuance  and sale by the  company  of the Notes to you
            will not  constitute  a  "prohibited  transaction"  (as such term is
            defined  in section  406 of ERISA or  section  4975 of the IRC) that
            could  subject  any  Person  to the  penalty  or  tax on  prohibited
            transactions  imposed by section 502 of ERISA or section 4975 of the
            IRC, and none of the company,  the Guarantor or any ERISA Affiliate,
            nor any  "employee  benefit  plan"  (as  such  term  is  hereinafter
            defined) of the Company,  the Guarantor,  or any ERISA  Affiliate or
            any  trust  created  thereunder  or  any  trustee  or  administrator
            thereof,  has  engaged in any  "prohibited  transaction"  that could
            subject  any such  Person,  or any  other  party  dealing  with such
            employee  benefit  plan or  trust,  to  such  penalty  or  tax.  The
            representation  by the Company and the  Guarantor  in the  preceding
            sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of the
            representations  in Section  1.3(b) hereof as to the source of funds
            used by you.

                (ii)  Part  3.12 of Annex 3 hereto  completely  lists  all ERISA
            Affiliates and all employee  benefit plans with respect to which the
            Guarantor or any "affiliate"  (as such term is hereinafter  defined)
            of  the  Guarantor  is  a  "party-in-interest"   (as  such  term  is
            hereinafter  defined)  or  in  respect  of  which  the  notes  could
            constitute  an  "employer  security"  (as such  term is  hereinafter
            defined).


      As used in this Section  3.12(c),  the terms  "employee  benefit plan" and
      "party-in-interest"  have the meanings specified in section 3 of ERISA and
      "affiliate" and "employer security" have the meanings specified in section
      407(d) of ERISA.

            (d) Reportable  Events. No Pension Plan or trust created  thereunder
      has been terminated,  and there have been no "reportable  events" (as such
      term is defined in section  4043 of ERISA),  with  respect to any  Pension
      Plan or trust created thereunder, which reportable event or events will or
      could  result in the  termination  of such Pension Plan and give rise to a
      liability of the Guarantor, or any ERISA Affiliate, in respect thereof.

                                        12

            (e)  Multiemployer  Plans.  Neither  the  Guarantor  nor  any  ERISA
      Affiliate  is,  nor has any of them ever been,  an  employer  required  to
      contribute to any Multiemployer Plan.

            (f) Multiple  Employer Pension Plans.  Neither the Guarantor nor any
      ERISA  Affiliate  is,  nor has  any of them  ever  been,  a  "contributing
      sponsor"  (as such  term is  defined  in  section  4001 of  ERISA)  in any
      Multiple Employer Pension Plan.

      3.13  Environmental Protection Laws.

            (a)  Compliance.   Each  of  the  Company,  the  Guarantor  and  the
      Subsidiaries  is in compliance with all  Environmental  Protection Laws in
      effect in each jurisdiction  where it is presently doing business,  except
      where any failures to comply with such  Environmental  Protection Laws, in
      the aggregate for all such  failures,  could not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) Liability. Neither the Company, the Guarantor nor any Subsidiary
      is subject  to any  liability  under any  Environmental  Protection  Laws,
      except such  liabilities,  in the aggregate for all such  liabilities,  as
      could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (iii)  communication,  written  or oral,  from any  Governmental

            leasing of any Property  resulting  in the release of any  Hazardous

            (if any) on, the Series B Notes at any time outstanding, and

                (iii) the due and punctual payment of all other amounts payable,
            and all other  indebtedness  owing, by the Company to the holders of
            the Notes under this  Agreement,  the  Indenture,  the Notes and any
            other Financing Document,

      in each case,  when and as the same shall become due and payable,  whether
      at maturity, pursuant to mandatory or optional prepayment, by acceleration
      or otherwise,  all in accordance with the terms and provisions  hereof and
      thereof;  it being the intent of the Guarantor that the guaranty set forth
      in this  Section 5 (the  "Unconditional  Guaranty")  shall be a continuing
      guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection; and

            (b) the punctual and faithful performance,  keeping, observance, and
      fulfillment  by the  Company  of all  duties,  agreements,  covenants  and
      obligations of the Company contained in this Agreement, the Indenture, the
      Notes and the other Financing Documents.

All of the  obligations  set forth in subsection  (a) and subsection (b) of this
Section 5.1 are referred to herein as the "Guarantied Obligations."
      
      5.2   Performance Under This Agreement.

      In the event the Company fails to pay, perform,  keep, observe, or fulfill
any  Guarantied  Obligation  in the  manner  provided  in  this  Agreement,  the
Indenture,  the Notes or in the other Financing  Documents,  the Guarantor shall
cause forthwith to be paid the moneys, or to be performed,  kept,  observed,  or
fulfilled  each of such  obligations,  in  respect  of which  such  failure  has
occurred in  accordance  with the terms and  provisions of this  Agreement,  the
Indenture,  the Notes and the other Financing  Documents.  In furtherance of the
foregoing, if an Event of Default shall exist, all of the Guarantied Obligations
shall,  in the manner and  subject to the  limitations  provided  herein for the
acceleration  of the Notes,  forthwith  become due and payable  without  notice,
regardless of whether the  acceleration of the Notes shall be stayed,  enjoined,
delayed or otherwise prevented.

hereunder,  each holder of Notes,  in the manner provided  herein,  by action or

      to (or otherwise not) enforce,  or (by action or inaction)  release all or

      this Agreement, the Indenture or any other Financing Document;

            (d) amend,  modify or supplement any one or more of the Notes,  this
      Agreement  or the  Indenture,  in  accordance  with  Section 9.5 hereof or
      Section 12.2 of the Indenture;

            (e) amend, modify or supplement any other Financing  Document,  in a
      way which does not  materially  increase  the  obligations  of the Company
      thereunder;
                 
            (f)  release  or  substitute  any one or more  of the  endorsers  or

      such  Guarantor or another  guarantor of the Company's  obligations  under
      this Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes or any other Financing Document.

      5.5   Waivers.

      To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor does hereby waive:

            (a) any notice of

                                       23

                (ii) any  purchase  of the Notes  under  this  Agreement  or the
            Indenture,  or the creation,  existence or acquisition of any of the
            Guarantied Obligations, or the amount of the Guarantied Obligations,
            subject to the  Guarantor's  right to make inquiry of each holder of
            Notes to ascertain the amount of the Guarantied Obligations owing to
            such holder of Notes at any reasonable time;

                (iii) adverse  change in the financial  condition of the Company

      to institute suit against the Company or any other guarantor or to exhaust
      the rights and remedies of any holder of Notes  against the Company or any
      other guarantor,  the Guarantor being bound to the payment of each and all
      Guarantied  Obligations,  whether now existing or hereafter  accruing,  as
      fully as if such Guarantied Obligations were directly owing to the holders
      of Notes by the Guarantor;

            (c)  the  benefit of any stay  (except in connection  with a pending
      appeal), valuation,  appraisal,  redemption or extension law now or at any
      time hereafter in force which, but for this waiver, might be applicable to
      any sale of Property of the Guarantor  made under any  judgment,  order or
      decree based on this Agreement,  and the Guarantor  covenants that it will
      not at any time insist upon or plead,  or in any manner  claim or take the
      benefit or advantage of such law;

            (d) any defense of objection to the  absolute,  primary,  continuing
      nature,  or the validity,  enforceability  or amount, of the Unconditional

      primary,  continuing nature, and the validity,  enforceability and amount,
      of  the  Unconditional  Guaranty  shall  be  unaffected  by),  any  of the
      following,

                (i) any change in future conditions

                (ii) any change of law,

                (iii)  any  invalidity  or  irregularity  with  respect  to  the
            issuance  or  assumption  of  any  obligations  (including,  without
            limitation,  this Agreement,  the Indenture,  the Notes or any other
            Financing Document) by the Company or any other Person,

                                       24

                (iv) the  execution  and  delivery of any  agreement at any time
            hereafter  (including,   without  limitation,  this  Agreement,  the
            Indenture, the Notes or any other Financing Document) of the Company
            or any other Person,

            sequestration  or  seizure  of any  Property  of the  Company or the
            Guarantor,   or   any   merger,    consolidation,    reorganization,

                (ix) the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of
            the  Company  or  the   Guarantor  in  respect  of  the   Guarantied
            Obligation,  and any other  defense that the Guarantor may otherwise

                (xi)  any  change  of  the  circumstances  of the  Company,  the
            Guarantor  or  any  other   Person,   whether  or  not  foreseen  or
            foreseeable,  whether  or  not  imputable  to  the  Company  or  the
            Guarantor,   including,   without   limitation,   impossibility   of
            performance through fire,  explosion,  accident,  labor disturbance,
            floods, droughts,  embargoes, wars (whether or not declared),  civil
            commotions,  acts of God or the public  enemy,  delays or failure of

            any other  force  majeure,  whether or not beyond the control of the
            Company or the Guarantor and whether or not of the kind hereinbefore

                (xii)  any  attachment,  claim,  demand,  charge,  lien,  order,
            process,  encumbrance  or any other  happening  or event or  reason,
            similar  or  dissimilar  to the  foregoing,  or any  withholding  or

            foreseen  or  unforeseen,  and  whether or not valid  incurred by or

            encumbrances of any nature, foreseen or unforeseen,  incurred by any
            Person, or against any sums

                                       25
<PAGE>


            payable under this Agreement,  the Indenture, the Notes or any other
            Financing  Document  that such sums would be rendered  inadequate or
            would be unavailable to make the payment as herein provided,

                (xiii) any change in the  ownership of the equity  securities of
            the Company or the Guarantor,

                (xiv) the lack of due  diligence  by the holders of the Notes in
            the  collection,  protection  or  realization  upon  any  collateral
            securing the Notes (including,  without limitation any rights of the
            Guarantor under North Carolina General Statute ss. 26-7), or

                (xv) any other  action,  happening,  event or reason  whatsoever
            that shall delay,  interfere with, hinder or prevent,  or in any way
            adversely affect, the performance by the Company or the Guarantor of
            any of its  obligations  under this  Agreement,  the Indenture,  the
            Notes or any other Financing Document.

      5.6   Certain Waivers of Subrogation, Reimbursement and Indemnity.

      The Guarantor  hereby  acknowledges and agrees that until such time as the
Guarantied  Obligations have been finally and  indefeasibly  paid, the Guarantor
shall not have any right of subrogation,  reimbursement, or indemnity whatsoever
in respect of the  Guarantied  Obligations,  and no right of recourse to or with
respect to any assets or Property of the  Company.  Nothing  shall  discharge or
satisfy the  obligations  of the Guarantor  hereunder  except the full and final
performance and indefeasible payment of the Guarantied Obligations.

      5.7   Invalid Payments.

      The  Guarantor  further  agrees  that,  to the extent the Company  makes a
payment or payments to any holder of a Note or Notes,  which payment or payments
or any part thereof are subsequently  invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required, for any of the foregoing reasons or for any
other reason, to be repaid or paid over to a custodian, trustee, receiver or any
other  party or  officer  under  any  bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,
insolvency,  readjustment  of  debt,  dissolution  or  liquidation  law  of  any
jurisdiction,  state or federal law, or any common law or equitable cause,  then
to the extent of such  payment or  repayment,  the  obligation  or part  thereof
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if said payment had not been made and the Guarantor shall be primarily liable
for such obligation.

      5.8   Marshaling.

      The  Guarantor  consents  and agrees that each  holder of Notes,  and each
Person  acting  for the  benefit  of each  holder  of  Notes,  shall be under no
obligation  to  marshal  any assets in favor of the  Guarantor  or against or in
payment of any or all of the Guarantied Obligations.

                                       26
<PAGE>


      5.9   Subordination.

      In the event  that,  for any  reason  whatsoever,  the  Company  is now or
hereafter becomes indebted to the Guarantor in respect of any Indebtedness,  the
Guarantor agrees that the amount of such Indebtedness, interest thereon, and all
other amounts due with respect thereto, shall, at all times during the existence
of an Event of Default,  be  subordinate  as to time of payment and in all other
respects to all the Guarantied Obligations,  and that the Guarantor shall not be
entitled to enforce or receive payment thereof until all sums then due and owing
to the holders of Notes in respect of the Guarantied Obligations shall have been
paid in full,  except that such Guarantor may enforce any obligations in respect
of any such Indebtedness  owing to the Guarantor from the Company so long as all
proceeds in respect of any recovery from such  enforcement  shall be held by the
Guarantor  in trust for the  benefit of the  holders of the Notes.  If any other
payment,  other than pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,  shall have
been made to the  Guarantor by the Company on any such  Indebtedness  during any
time  that an Event of  Default  exists  and there  are  Guarantied  Obligations
outstanding, the Guarantor shall hold in trust all such payments for the benefit
of the holders of Notes.

      5.10  Setoff, Counterclaim or Other Deductions.

      Except as otherwise  required by law, each payment by the guarantor  shall
be made without setoff, counterclaim or other deduction.

      5.11  No Election of Remedies by Noteholders.

      Each holder of Notes shall,  individually or collectively,  have the right
to seek recourse against the Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for herein
for the Guarantied Obligations.  No election to proceed in one form of action or
proceeding,  or against any party,  or on any  obligation,  shall  constitute  a
waiver  of such  holder's  right to  proceed  in any  other  form of  action  or
proceeding or against other parties unless such holder has expressly waived such
right in writing.  Specifically,  but without  limiting  the  generality  of the
foregoing, no action or proceeding by any holder of Notes against the Company or
the Guarantor  under any document or instrument  evidencing  obligations  of the
Company or the  Guarantor  to such holder of Notes  shall serve to diminish  the
liability of any Guarantor under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,
this  Section 5),  except to the extent  that such  holder of Notes  finally and
unconditionally shall have realized payment by such action or proceeding.

      5.12  Separate Action; Other Enforcement Rights.

            (a) Subject to Section 8.2 of the Indenture,  each of the rights and
      remedies  granted  under this Section 5 to each holder of Notes in respect
      of the Notes held by such holder may be exercised  by such holder  without
      notice by such  holder to, or the  consent of or any other  action by, any
      other holder of Notes.

            (b) Each  holder  of Notes  may  proceed,  as  provided  in  Section
      5.12(a),  to protect  and enforce  the  Unconditional  Guaranty by suit or
      suits or proceedings in equity,  at law or in bankruptcy,  and whether for
      the specific  performance of any covenant or agreement  contained  therein
      (including,  without limitation, in this Section 5) or in execution of aid
      of any power  herein  granted  or for the  recovery  of  judgment  for the
      obligations

                                       27
<PAGE>


      hereby  guarantied or for the  enforcement  of any other proper,  legal or
      equitable remedy available under applicable law.

      5.13  Noteholder Setoff.

      Each holder of Notes shall have,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by law
and this  Agreement,  a right of set-off against any and all credits and any and
all other Property of the Guarantor,  now or at any time whatsoever  with, or in
the possession of, such holder,  or anyone acting for such holder, to ensure the
full performance of any and all obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.

      5.14  Delay or Omission; No Waiver.

      No course of  dealing  on the part of any  holder of Notes and no delay or
failure  on the  part  of any  such  Person  to  exercise  any  right  hereunder
(including,  without  limitation,  this  Section 5) shall  impair  such right or
operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise  prejudice such Person's  rights,
powers and remedies hereunder. Every right and remedy given by the Unconditional
Guaranty or by law to any holder of Notes may be exercised  from time to time as
often as may be deemed expedient by such Person.

      5.15  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

      If any holder of Notes shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any
right or remedy under the  Unconditional  Guaranty,  under any Note held by such
holder of Notes, and such proceeding shall have been dismissed,  discontinued or
abandoned  for any  reason,  or shall  have been  determined  adversely  to such
holder,  then and in every  such case  each such  holder,  the  Company  and the
Guarantor  shall,  except as may be limited  or  affected  by any  determination
(including,  without  limitation,  any determination in connection with any such
dismissal) in such  proceeding,  be restored  severally and  respectively to its
respective former positions hereunder and thereunder, and thereafter, subject as
aforesaid,  the rights and remedies of such  holders of Notes shall  continue as
though no such proceeding had been instituted.

      5.16  Cumulative Remedies.

      No remedy  under  this  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  this
Section  5),  the  Indenture,  the Notes or any  other  Financing  Documents  is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every remedy shall be
cumulative  and in addition to any and every other remedy given pursuant to this
Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  this Section 5), the  Indenture or
pursuant to the Notes.

      5.17  Execution and Delivery of Notes by Guarantor.

      The  Guarantor  shall,  upon the  issuance of any new Notes by the Company
pursuant  to  Section  2.7 of  the  Indenture,  cause  the  confirmation  of the
Unconditional  Guaranty provided for thereon to be duly executed. The failure of
the Guarantor to execute and deliver the  confirmation  as required herein shall
not relieve the  Guarantor of its  Unconditional  Guaranty  with respect to such
Note.

                                       28
<PAGE>


      5.18  Survival.

      So long as the  Guarantied  Obligations  shall  not have  been  fully  and
finally performed and indefeasibly  paid, the obligations of the Guarantor under
this  Section 5 shall  survive  the  transfer  and  payment  of any Note and the
payment in full of all the Notes.
      
6.    COVENANTS OF THE GUARANTOR

      The Guarantor  covenants that on and after the Initial Closing Date and so
long as any of the Notes shall be outstanding:

      6.1   Payment of Taxes and Claims.

      The Guarantor will pay, and will cause each Restricted  Subsidiary to pay,
before they become delinquent:

            (a) all  taxes,  assessments  and  governmental  charges  or  levies
      imposed upon it or its Property; and

            (b) all  claims or  demands  of  materialmen,  mechanics,  carriers,
      warehousemen,  vendors,  landlords and other like Persons that, if unpaid,
      might result in the creation of a Lien upon its Property;

provided, that items of the foregoing description need not be paid

                (i)  while  being  actively  contested  in  good  faith  and  by
            appropriate  proceedings as long as adequate book reserves have been
            established and maintained and exist with respect thereto, and

                (ii) so long as the title of the  Company  to,  and its right to
            use, such Property, is not materially adversely affected thereby.

      6.2   Maintenance of Properties; Corporate Existence; etc.

      The Guarantor will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to:

            (a) Property - maintain its Property in good  condition  and working
      order,  ordinary wear and tear excepted,  and make all necessary renewals,
      replacements, additions, betterments and improvements thereto;

            (b)  Insurance  - maintain,  with  financially  sound and  reputable
      insurers, insurance with respect to its Property and business against such
      casualties  and   contingencies,   of  such  types   (including,   without
      limitation,  insurance with respect to losses arising out of Property loss
      or damage,  public liability,  business  interruption,  larceny,  workers'
      compensation, embezzlement or other criminal misappropriation) and in such
      amounts as is customary in accordance with sound business practices in the
      case of corporations of established  reputations  engaged in the same or a
      similar  business and similarly  situated;  from and after January 1, 1996
      all such insurance shall be placed

                                       29
<PAGE>


      with insurers  accorded a rating by A.M. Best Company of "A" or better and
      a size  rating of "X" or better (or  comparable  ratings  by a  comparable
      rating  agency).  For purposes of this Section 6.2 and the other Financing
      Documents,  an insurer shall be considered to have satisfied the aforesaid
      rating and size requirements with respect to any policy to the extent that
      it has ceded  liability  under such policy to a reinsurer  which satisfies
      such  rating and size  requirements  pursuant to a  reinsurance  agreement

enter into any transaction, including, without limitation, the purchase, sale or
exchange of Property or the rendering of any service, with any Affiliate, except
transactions  (a)  having  terms  no less  favorable  to the  Guarantor  or such

      Guarantor  will not at any time permit the present  value of all  employee
      benefits  vested  under  each  Pension  Plan to exceed  the assets of such

      good faith judgment of the Guarantor and will comply with all requirements
      of law.

            liability under section 4062 of ERISA;

                (v) at any time be an "employer"  (as defined in section 3(5) of
            ERISA)  required  to  contribute  to  any  Multiemployer  Plan  or a
            "substantial  employer"  (as  defined  in  section  4001  of  ERISA)
            required to contribute to any Multiple  Employer Pension Plan if, at
            such time, it could reasonably be expected that the Guarantor or any
            Subsidiary  will  incur  withdrawal  liability  in  respect  of such
            Multiemployer  Plan or  Multiple  Employer  Pension  Plan  and  such
            liability,  if incurred,  together with the aggregate  amount of all
            other  withdrawal  liability  as  to  which  there  is a  reasonable
            expectation of incurrence by the Guarantor or any  Subsidiary  under
            any one or more  Multiemployer  Plans or Multiple  Employer  Pension
            Plans,  could  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material  Adverse
            Effect.

      6.8   Pro-Rata Offers.

      The  Guarantor  will  not,  and  will not  permit  any  Subsidiary  or any

<PAGE>


                     (B) immediately  before and after the  consummation of such
                Transfer,  and after giving effect thereto,  no Default or Event

      Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  a Transfer of Property shall be deemed to
be excluded from the foregoing  provisions of this Section 6.12  (including  any
calculation made pursuant to Section  6.12(a)(v)(A)(2)) if such Transfer is to a
Person other than an Affiliate for cash consideration  which Transfer is deemed,
in the good  faith  opinion  of the Board of  Directors  (or  management  of the
Company in the case of a sale involving assets having an aggregate book value of
less than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000)), to be for the
Fair Market  Value of such  Property  and in the best  interests of the Company,

                (II) contemporaneously with such Transfer the entire proceeds of
            such  Transfer  are  applied to the payment of Senior  Funded  Debt,
            provided that any  prepayment of Senior Funded Debt under a facility
            or  arrangement  that  permits the  reborrowing  of such Debt by the
            Guarantor or the Restricted  Subsidiaries shall not be counted under
            this clause (II) unless the  availability  to reborrow  such Debt is
            permanently  reduced by an amount equal to the  principal  amount of
            such Senior Funded Debt repaid.

         (b) Transfers of Subsidiary  Stock. The Guarantor will not, nor will it
         permit any Restricted  Subsidiary to,  transfer any shares of the stock
         (or any  warrants,  rights  or  options  to  purchase  stock  or  other
         Securities  exchangeable for or convertible into stock) of a Restricted
         Subsidiary (such stock, warrants,  rights, options and other Securities
         herein called "Subsidiary Stock"),  nor will any Restricted  Subsidiary
         issue,  sell or otherwise  dispose of any shares of its own  Subsidiary
         Stock, provided that the foregoing restrictions do not apply to:

                (i) the issuance by a Subsidiary of shares of its own Subsidiary
            Stock  to  either  the  Guarantor  or  a   Wholly-Owned   Restricted

                (ii)  Transfers by the  Guarantor  or a Subsidiary  of shares of

                (iii) the  issuance by a  Subsidiary  of  directors'  qualifying
            shares; and

                (iv) the Transfer of all of the Subsidiary Stock of a Subsidiary
            owned by the Guarantor and the Subsidiaries if:

                Section 6.12(a)(v) hereof;

                     (B) in connection with such Transfer the entire  Investment
                (whether represented by stock, Debt, claims or otherwise) of the
                Guarantor  and the  other  Subsidiaries  in such  Subsidiary  is
                Transferred to a Person other than the Guarantor or a Subsidiary
                not being simultaneously disposed of;

                     (C) the  Subsidiary  being  disposed  of has no  continuing
                Investment  in any other  Subsidiary  not  being  simultaneously
                disposed of or in the Guarantor; and

                     (D) immediately  before and after the  consummation of such
                Transfer,  and after giving effect thereto,  no Default or Event
                of Default would exist.

For purposes of determining the book value of Property  constituting  Subsidiary
Stock being  Transferred as provided in clause (iv) above, such book value shall
be deemed to be the aggregate  book value of all assets of the  Subsidiary  that
shall have issued such Subsidiary Stock.

and each holder of Notes may destroy any original  document so  reproduced.  The
Company and the Guarantor agree and stipulate that any such  reproduction  shall

whether or not such reproduction was made by such holder of Notes in the regular
course of business) and that any enlargement,  facsimile or further reproduction

by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, hereunder.

      9.4   Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
            and be  binding  upon  the  successors  and  assigns  of each of the
            parties  hereto.  The  provisions  hereof are intended to be for the
            benefit of all holders,  form time to time,  of Notes,  and shall be

            Purchaser or the Purchaser's successor or assign.

      9.5   Amendment and Waiver.

            (a) General  Requirements.  This  Agreement may be amended,  and the
      observance  of any term  hereof or thereof  may be waived,  with (and only
      with) the  written  consent  of (i) in the case of  Section 1 through  and
      Section 4,  inclusive,  and  Section 9 (and the  definitions  set forth in
      Section 8 hereof of any defined terms used in such Sections), the Company,
      the Guarantor and the Required Holders, and (ii) with respect to all other
      Sections hereof, the Guarantor and the Required Holders,  provided that no
      such amendment or waiver shall, without the written consent of the holders
      of all  Notes at the time  outstanding,  amend  (i)  Section  5,  (ii) the
      definition of "Required Holders," or (iii) this Section 9.5.

            (b) Solicitation.

                (i)  Solicitation.  Neither the Company nor the Guarantor  shall
            solicit,  request or  negotiate  for or with respect to any proposed
            waiver  or  amendment  of  any of the  provisions  hereof  or of the
            Indenture or the Notes unless the Purchaser and each other holder of
            the Notes  (irrespective  of the  amount of Notes  then owned by it)
            shall be provided by the Company or the  Guarantor,  as the case may
            be,  with  sufficient  information  to enable it to make an informed
            decision with respect  thereto.  Executed or true and correct copies
            of any waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this
            Section 9.5 shall be delivered by the

                                      57

<PAGE>

            Company or the  Guarantor,  as the case may be, to the Purchaser and
            each other holder of outstanding Notes forthwith  following the date
            on which the same  shall have been  executed  and  delivered  by all
            holders of  outstanding  Notes  required to consent or agree to such
            waiver or consent.
            
                (ii)  Payment.  Neither  the Company  nor the  Guarantor  shall,
            directly or  indirectly,  pay or cause to be paid any  remuneration,
            whether  by way  of  supplemental  or  additional  interest,  fee or
            otherwise,  or grant any  security,  to the  Purchaser  or any other
            holder  of Notes as  consideration  for or as an  inducement  to the
            entering  into by any holder of Notes of any waiver or  amendment of
            any of the terms and provisions  hereof unless such  remuneration is
            concurrently paid, or security is concurrently  granted,  ratably to
            the Purchaser and the other holders of all Notes then outstanding.

                (iii)  Scope of  Consent.  Any  consent  made  pursuant  to this
            Section 9.5 by a holder of Notes that has  transferred or has agreed
            to transfer its Notes to the Company, the Guarantor,  any Subsidiary
            or any  Affiliate  and has  provided  or has agreed to provide  such
            written consent as a condition to such transfer shall be void and of
            no  force  and  effect  except  solely  as to such  holder,  and any
            amendments  effected or waivers granted or to be effected or granted
            that would not have been or would not be so  effected or granted but
            for such  consent  (and the  consents of all other  holders of Notes
            that were acquired  under the same or similar  conditions)  shall be
            void and of no  force  and  effect,  retroactive  to the  date  such
            amendment or waiver initially took or takes effect, except solely as
            to such holder.

            (c) Binding Effect. Except as provided in Section 9.5(a) and Section
      9.5(b)(iii)  hereof,  any amendment or waiver  consented to as provided in
      this  Section  9.5 shall  apply  equally  to the  Purchaser  and all other
      holders  of Notes and  shall be  binding  upon  them and upon each  future
      holder of any Note and upon the Company and the  Guarantor  whether or not
      such Note shall have been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver.  No
      such  amendment  or  waiver  shall  extend to or  affect  any  obligation,
      covenant,  agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or
      waived or impair any right consequent thereon.

      9.6   Expenses.

      The Company shall pay when billed

            (a) all expenses  incurred by the  Purchaser and any other holder of
      Notes  in  connection  with  the  enforcement  of any  rights  under  this
      Agreement  and the  Notes  (including,  without  limitation,  all fees and
      expenses of the Purchaser's or such other holder's special counsel), and

            (b)  all  expenses  relating  to  the  consideration,   negotiation,
      preparation or execution of any amendments,  waivers or consents  pursuant

      any such amendments,  waivers or consents are executed, including, without
      limitation any amendments, waivers or consents resulting

COMPANY AND THE  GUARANTOR  HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVE,  TO THE  FULLEST  EXTENT

in the nature of a deficiency  judgment or seeking  personal  liability shall be
asked for or (if obtained)  enforced against such Person,  and provided further,
that the  foregoing  provisions  shall not preclude the Security  Trustee or the
holders of any of the Notes from pursuing any rights or remedies against (i) the
Guarantor under the Unconditional  Guaranty,  (ii) the Company or any partner of

                         respect to the Land and the Improvement, respectively;

or Persons as the Lessor shall specify in writing to Lessee.

Lessor,  the  Trustee or any party to any  agreements  related  thereto  for any
reason  whatsoever.  Lessee assumes the sole  responsibility  for the condition,
use,  operation,  maintenance,  and management of the Leased Property and Lessor
shall have no  responsibility in respect thereof and shall have no liability for
damage to the  property  of  either  Lessee  or any  subtenant  of Lessee on any
account or for any reason  whatsoever  other than by reason of Lessor's  willful

any Operative Document.

                                    ARTICLE V
                       CONDITION AND USE OF LEASED PROPERTY

         During the Lease Term, Lessor's interest in the Improvement (whether or
not  completed) and the Land is demised and let by Lessor "AS IS" subject to (i)
the rights of any  parties in  possession  thereof,  (ii) the state of the title
thereto  existing  at the  time  Lessor  acquired  its  interest  in the  Leased
Property,  (iii)  any  state  of facts  which an  accurate  survey  or  physical
inspection might show (including the survey delivered on the Closing Date), (iv)
all applicable law and (v) any violations of applicable law which may exist upon
or subsequent to the commencement of the Lease Term. LESSEE  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT,
ALTHOUGH LESSOR WILL OWN AND HOLD TITLE TO THE LEASED PROPERTY, LESSEE IS SOLELY
RESPONSIBLE  FOR THE DESIGN,  DEVELOPMENT,  BUDGETING  AND  CONSTRUCTION  OF THE
IMPROVEMENT [IMPROVEMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS] AND ANY ALTERATIONS. NEITHER LESSOR
NOR THE TRUSTEE HAVE MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY  REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY,  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,  OR  SHALL  BE  DEEMED  TO HAVE  ANY  LIABILITY
WHATSOEVER  AS TO THE VALUE,  MERCHANTABILITY,  TITLE,  HABITABILITY  CONDITION,
DESIGN,  OPERATION,  OR  FITNESS  FOR USE OF THE  LEASED  PROPERTY  (OR ANY PART
THEREOF), OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
WITH RESPECT TO THE LEASED  PROPERTY (OR ANY PART THEREOF),  ALL SUCH WARRANTIES
BEING HEREBY

                                     7
<PAGE>

DISCLAIMED,  AND NEITHER  LESSOR NOR THE LENDER  SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LATENT,
HIDDEN,  OR PATENT DEFECT THEREIN OR THE FAILURE OF THE LEASED PROPERTY,  OR ANY
PART THEREOF,  TO COMPLY WITH ANY APPLICABLE  LAW. As between Lessor and Lessee,
Lessee has been afforded full opportunity to inspect the Land, is satisfied with
the  results  of its  inspections  of the Land and is  entering  into this Lease
solely on the basis of the results of its own inspections and all risks incident
to the matters  discussed in the two preceding  sentences,  as between Lessor or
the  Trustee,  on the one hand,  and  Lessee,  on the other,  are to be borne by
Lessee.  The provisions of this Article have been  negotiated and, except to the
extent otherwise expressly stated, the foregoing provisions are intended to be a
complete  exclusion and negation of any  representations or warranties by Lessor
or the Trustee, express or implied, with respect to the Leased Property that may
arise pursuant to any law now or hereafter in effect or otherwise.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                      LIENS; EASEMENTS; PARTIAL CONVEYANCES

         Commencing on the date that  Construction  in completed and thereafter,
Lessee  shall not  directly or  indirectly  create,  incur or assume,  any lien,
encumbrance or security interest on or with respect to the Leased Property,  the
Construction,  title thereto,  or any interest  therein  ("Lien")  including any
Liens which arise out of the possession, use, occupancy, construction, repair or
rebuilding of the Leased  Property or by reason of labor or materials  furnished
or claimed to have been furnished to Lessee, or any of its contractors or agents
or by reason of the financing of any personalty or equipment purchased or leased
by Lessee or Alterations  constructed by Lessee,  except in all cases  Permitted
Exceptions.

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  paragraph,  at the  request of Lessee,
Lessor  shall,  from  time to time  during  the Lease  Term and upon  reasonable
advance written notice from Lessee and receipt of the materials specified in the
next  succeeding  sentence,  consent to and join in any (i) grant of  easements,
licenses, rights of way and other rights in the nature of easements,  including,
without limitation,  utility easements to facilitate  Lessee's use,  development
and  construction  of the  Leased  Property,  (ii)  release  or  termination  of
easements,  licenses,  rights of way or other  rights in the nature of easements
which are for the benefit of the Land or the Improvement or any portion thereof,
(iii)  dedication  or  transfer of portions  of the Land,  not  improved  with a
building,  for  road,  highway  or other  public  purposes,  (iv)  execution  of
agreements   for  ingress  and  egress  and  amendments  to  any  covenants  and
restrictions  affecting the Land or the  Improvement or any portion  thereof and
(v)  request to any  governmental  authority  for  platting  or  subdivision  or
replotting  or  resubdivision  approval  with respect to the Land or any portion
thereof or any parcel of land of which the Land or any portion  thereof  forms a
part  or  a  request  for  any  variance  from  zoning  or  other   governmental
requirements.  Lessor's  obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
subject to the requirements that:

                 (i)     any such  action  shall be at the sole cost and expense
                         of  Lessee  and  Lessee  shall pay all  reasonable  and
                         documented out-of-pocket costs

                         of Lessor  in  connection therewith (including, without
                         limitation,  the  reasonable  and  documented  fees  of
                         attorneys, architects,  engineers, planners, appraisers
                         and other  professionals  reasonably retained by Lessor
                         in connection with any such action);

                (ii)     Lessee shall have  delivered to Lessor a certificate of
                         the Chief Financial  Officer of Lessee stating that (1)
                         such action will not cause the Land or the  Improvement
                         or any portion thereof to fail to comply in any respect
                         with the provisions of the Lease or any other Operative
                         Documents or in any respect with applicable law and (2)
                         such action will not materially  reduce the fair market
                         sales value,  utility or useful life of the Land or the
                         Improvement nor Lessor's interest therein;

               (iii)     any consideration  received in connection with any such
                         action shall be paid as provided for in the  Indenture;
                         and

                (iv)    in the case of any release or conveyance,  if Lessor so
                         requests,  Lessee will cause to be issued and delivered
                         to Lessor by the Title Insurance Company an endorsement
                         to  the  Title  Policy  pursuant  to  which  the  Title
                         Insurance  Company  agrees that its  liability  for the
                         payment  of any loss or  damage  under  the  terms  and
                         provisions  of the Title Policy will not be affected by
                         reason of the fact that a portion of the real  property
                         referred to in Schedule A of the Title  Policy has been
                         released or conveyed by Lessor.

                                     ARTICLE VII
                                MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR;
                      ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS

         SECTION 7.1 Maintenance and Repair; Compliance With Law. Lessee, at its
own expense,  shall at all times (i) maintain the Leased Property in good repair
and condition  (subject to ordinary wear and tear),  in accordance  with prudent
industry  standards  and,  in any  event,  in no less a manner as other  similar
automobile auction facilities owned or leased by ADESA,  Lessee or ADESA's other
subsidiaries,  (ii)  make all  alterations  in  accordance  with,  and  maintain
(whether  or  not  such  maintenance   requires   structural   modifications  or
alterations)  and operate and otherwise  keep the Leased  Property in compliance
with, all applicable laws and (iii) make all material repairs,  replacements and
renewals  of the Leased  Property or any part  thereof  which may be required to
keep the Leased Property in the condition  required by the preceding clauses (i)
and (ii). Lessee shall perform the foregoing maintenance  obligations regardless
of whether the Leased  Property is occupied  or  unoccupied.  Lessee  waives any
right  that it may now  have or  hereafter  acquire  to (i)  require  Lessor  to
maintain,  repair,  replace,  alter,  remove or  rebuild  all or any part of the
Leased  Property or (ii) make  repairs at the expense of Lessor  pursuant to any
applicable law or other  agreements or otherwise.  Lessor shall not be liable to
Lessee or to any contractors, subcontractors, laborers,

                                     9
<PAGE>
materialmen, suppliers or vendors for services performed or material provided on
or in connection with the Leased Property or any part thereof.  Lessor shall not
be required to maintain,  alter, repair,  rebuild or replace the Leased Property
in any way.

         SECTION 7.2 Alterations.  Lessee may, without the consent of Lessor, at
Lessee's own cost and expense, make alterations which, in the reasonable opinion
of the chief  executive  officer of  Lessee,  do not  diminish  the value of the
Leased Property.

                                 ARTICLE VIII
                                     USE

         Lessee  shall use the Leased  Property or any part thereof only for the
purpose of used automobile  auction  business capable of operating not less than
the  number  of  simultaneous   auction  lines  anticipated  in  the  Plans  and
Specifications, together with related or ancillary businesses including, without
limitation, automobile storage, repair and preparation,  transportation,  direct
sales or other businesses related to used automobile auctions.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   INSURANCE

             (a) During the  Construction  and at any time during which any part
of the Improvement or any Alteration is under construction and as to any part of
the Improvement or any Alteration under construction,  Lessee shall maintain, at
its sole cost and expense, as a part of its blanket policies or otherwise,  "all
risks"  nonreporting  completed  value form of builder's risk  insurance,  which
insurance and policies  shall,  in each case, be in the amounts and otherwise be
consistent  with any  applicable  requirements  set  forth in the Note  Purchase
Agreement, Indenture or Mortgage.

             (b) Following the Completion of the  Construction  and at all times
thereafter  during the Lease Term,  Lessee shall maintain,  at its sole cost and
expense, as a part of its blanket policies or otherwise,  insurance against loss
or damage to the  Improvement by fire and other risks,  including  comprehensive
boiler and machinery  coverage,  on terms and in amounts no less  favorable than
insurance  covering other similar properties owned by the Lessee and that are in
accordance with normal industry practice, but in no event less than the coverage
in place on the date hereof,  which  insurance and policies shall, in each case,
be in the amounts and otherwise be consistent  with any applicable  requirements
set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, Indenture or Mortgage.

             (c) During the Lease Term, Lessee shall maintain,  at its sole cost
and expense,  commercial general liability insurance,  as is ordinarily procured
by Persons  who own or operate  similar  properties  in the same  market,  which
insurance and policies  shall,  in each case, be in the amounts and otherwise be
consistent  with any  applicable  requirements  set  forth in the Note  Purchase
Agreement,  Indenture  or  Mortgage.  Such  insurance  shall be on terms  and in
amounts that are no less

                                     10
<PAGE>

favorable than insurance maintained by Lessee with respect to similar properties
that it owns and that are in accordance with normal industry practice, but in no
event less than the coverage  (including types and amounts) in place on the date
hereof. Such insurance policies shall also provide that Lessee's insurance shall
be considered primary  insurance.  Nothing in this Article shall prohibit Lessor
from  carrying  at its own expense  other  insurance  on or with  respect to the
Leased Property;  provided,  however, that any insurance carried by Lessor shall
not prevent Lessee from carrying the insurance required hereby.

             (d) Each  policy of  insurance  maintained  by Lessee  pursuant  to
clauses (a) and (b) of this Article shall provide that all Casualty Proceeds (as
defined and provided for in the  Indenture)  shall be payable to the Trustee for
deposit and disbursement as provided for in Section 6.3 of the Indenture.

             (e) Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof and within thirty
(30) days after the date upon which the Construction is completed,  Lessee shall
furnish Lessor and the Trustee with certificates  showing the insurance required
under  this  Article  to be in effect  and  naming  Lessor  and the  Trustee  as
additional insureds. Such certificates shall include a provision for thirty (30)
days'  advance  written  notice by the  insurer to Lessor and the Trustee in the
event of  cancellation  or  expiration  or nonpayment of premium with respect to
such insurance, and shall include a customary breach of warranty clause.

             (f) Each policy of insurance  maintained by Lessee pursuant to this
Article shall (i) contain the waiver of any right of  subrogation of the insurer
against Lessor and the Trustee and (ii) provide that in respect of the interests
of Lessor and the Trustee,  such policies  shall not be invalidated by any fraud
or misrepresentation of Lessee or any other Person acting on behalf of
Lessee.

             (g) On and after January 1, 1996, all insurance policies carried in
accordance  with this Article  shall be maintained  with  insurers  rated at the
inception of such policies at least "A" by A.M. Best & Company, and in all cases
the insurer shall be qualified to insure risks in the State of Tennessee.

                                  ARTICLE X
                          ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASING

         Lessee may not assign any of its  right,  title or  interest  in, to or
under this Lease. Lessee may sublease all or any portion of the Leased Property;
provided,  however,  that (i) all  obligations  of Lessee shall continue in full
effect as obligations of a principal and not of a guarantor or surety, as though
no sublease had been made,  (ii) such  sublease  shall be expressly  subject and
subordinate to this Lease,  the Indenture,  the Mortgage and the other Operative
Documents and (iii) each such sublease shall terminate on or before the last day
of the Lease Term. Except as provided for in the Indenture, this Lease shall not
be mortgaged or pledged by Lessee, nor shall Lessee mortgage or

                                     11
<PAGE>

pledge any  interest in the Leased  Property or any  portion  thereof.  Any such
mortgage or pledge shall be void.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                   LOSS, DESTRUCTION, CONDEMNATION OR DAMAGE

         SECTION 11.1 Available Proceeds. All Casualty Proceeds and Condemnation
Awards (both as defined in the Indenture,  and which are collectively defined in
the Indenture as "Available Proceeds") shall be remitted and paid to the Trustee
by the Lessee,  the Lessor or ADESA, as applicable,  for deposit in the Casualty
Account (as defined and established under the Indenture) for  disbursement,  all
as provided for in Section 6.3 of the Indenture.  Until such time as the Lessee,
the Lessor,  ADESA or any of their  respective  agents or  representatives  have
remitted and paid any Available Proceeds to the Trustee,  such Person shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the benefit of the Trustee.  In the event that at any
time during the Lease Term, the Indenture has been terminated, the Lessor shall,
for purposes of this Article,  be treated as the Trustee,  and shall deposit and
disburse any  Available  Proceeds in  substantially  the manner  provided for in
Section 6.3 of the Indenture as if it were the Trustee.

         SECTION 11.2 Repairs and Restoration. In the event of any Total Loss or
Partial Loss (collectively,  "Loss"), other than a Total Loss which, in the good
faith judgment of the chief  executive  officer of Lessee renders the repair and
restoration  of the  Leased  Property  impractical  or  uneconomical  including,
without  limitation,  any  condemnation of the Leased Property  resulting in the
taking of all or  substantially  all of the  Leased  Property  (collectively,  a
"Complete Taking"), then:

                 (i)     the  Lessee and ADESA  shall  repair  and  restore  the
                         Leased  Property  such that the Leased  Property  as so
                         repaired and restored is, in the good faith judgment of
                         the chief  executive  officer  of Lessee  adequate  and
                         appropriate  for the conduct of an  automobile  auction
                         and  ancillary  business  of at least  the  same  type,
                         quality  and scale as that  conducted  by the Lessee on
                         the Leased Property immediately prior to such Loss;

                (ii)     the  Available  Proceeds,  if any, with respect to such
                         Loss,  if any,  shall be  disbursed  by the  Trustee as
                         provided for in Section 6.3 of the Indenture;

               (iii)     the  inadequacy of the  Available  Proceeds to fund the
                         cost of any  such  repairs  or  restoration  shall  not
                         diminish the obligation of the Lessee and ADESA to make
                         such  repairs  or  restoration,   which  obligation  is
                         unconditional and absolute; and

                (iv)     upon  completion of such repairs and restoration and at
                         all  times  during  the  conduct  of such  repairs  and
                         restoration,  the Lessor and its  representatives  may,
                         upon three (3) business days' notice to Lessee,

                                     12
<PAGE>
                         inspect the Leased Property and the progress of the 
                         restoration  and rebuilding of the  Improvement and the
                         Land. All reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
                         of such  inspections  incurred by Lessor and the Lender
                         will be paid by Lessee promptly after written  request.
                         No such inspection  shall  unreasonably  interfere with
                         Lessee's  operations  or the  operations  of any  other
                         occupant of the Leased Property. None of the inspecting
                         parties shall have any duty to make any such inspection
                         or inquiry  and none of the  inspecting  parties  shall
                         incur  any  liability  or  obligation  by reason of not
                         making  any such  inspection  or  inquiry.  None of the
                         inspecting   parties   shall  incur  any  liability  or
                         obligation  by reason of making any such  inspection or
                         inquiry unless and to the extent such inspecting  party
                         causes damage to the Leased Property or any property of
                         Lessee or any other  Person  during  the course of such
                         inspection.

         SECTION 11.3 Complete Taking. In the event of any Complete Taking with 
respect to the Leased Property.

                 (i)     the Lessee shall provide to the Lessor a  certification
                         stating that the chief executive  officer of Lessee has
                         determined  in good faith that such Loss  constitutes a
                         Complete  Taking with respect to the Leased Property as
                         defined in this Lease;

                (ii)     the Lessee and ADESA shall not be obligated or required
                         to make any  repairs  to or  restoration  of the Leased
                         Property, other than those repairs, if any, required by
                         applicable  law or necessary to  adequately  secure the
                         Leased Property or comply with the  requirements of any
                         applicable  insurance policy or any applicable  safety,
                         health or environmental regulations;

               (iii)     any Available  Proceeds with respect to such Loss shall
                         be disbursed as provided for in Section  6.3(b)(iii) of
                         the Indenture; and

                (iv)     except  as  otherwise  provided  for  in  Section  11.9
                         hereof,  this  Lease  shall  remain  in full  force and
                         effect.

         SECTION 11.4  Application  of Available  Proceeds.  In the event of any
Partial  Loss or Total Loss  (whether  or not such Loss  constitutes  a Complete
Taking),  Available  Proceeds,  if any,  with  respect  to such  Loss  shall  be
disbursed only as provided for in Section 6.3(b) of the Indenture; and:

                 (i)     Any  Available  Proceeds  disbursed  as provided for in

                         respect  to  the  prepayment  of the  principal  amount
                         thereof or  disbursed  to the Lessor as provided for in
                         Section  6.3(b) of the Indenture  shall be deemed to be
                         and  shall be  treated  as  Casualty  and  Condemnation
                         Credits  for  purposes  of this Lease and the  Guaranty
                         Agreement;

                (ii)     Any  Available   Proceeds  disbursed  as  provided  for
                         Section  6.3(b)(iii) of the Indenture to the holders of
                         Outstanding  Notes  with  respect  to  the  payment  of
                         accrued  but  unpaid  interest  shall be deemed to have
                         been paid to the Lessor as Basic Rent; and

               (iii)     Any  Available   Proceeds  disbursed  as  provided  for
                         Section  6.3(b)(iii) of the Indenture to the holders of
                         Outstanding  Notes with  respect to the payment of Make
                         Whole  Amount (as  defined in the  Indenture)  shall be
                         deemed to have been paid to the Lessor as  Supplemental
                         Rent.

         SECTION 11.5 Prosecution of Awards.

             (a) With  respect to any  condemnation  with  respect to any Leased
Property,  Lessee shall control the negotiations with the relevant  governmental
authority;  provided,  however,  that if an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing Lessor or its assigns shall control such negotiations.  Lessee
hereby  irrevocably  assigns,  transfers  and sets over to Lessor  all rights of
Lessee to any award  made  during  the  continuance  of an Event of  Default  on
account of any  condemnation  and, if there will not be  separate  awards to the
Lessor and the Lessee on account of such  condemnation,  irrevocably  authorizes
and empowers  Lessor during the  continuance  of an Event of Default,  with full
power of substitution  in the name of Lessee or otherwise (but without  limiting
the obligations of Lessee under this Article),  to file and prosecute what would
otherwise  be Lessee's  claim for any such Award and, in the case of Lessor,  to
collect,  receipt for and retain the same in accordance  with Section 6.3 of the
Indenture;  provided,  however,  that in any event Lessor may participate in any
such  negotiations,  and no  settlement  will be  made  without  Lessor's  prior
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

             (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may prosecute, and Lessor
shall have no interest in, any claim with respect to Lessee's  personal property
and equipment and Lessee's relocation expenses.

         SECTION 11.6  Application of Certain  Payments Not Relating to an Event
of Complete  Taking.  In case of a  requisition  for  temporary  use of all or a
portion of the Leased  Property which is not an event of Complete  Taking,  this
Lease shall remain in full force and effect,  without any abatement or reduction
of Basic Rent or Additional  Rent, and the Awards for the Leased Property shall,
unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, be paid to Lessee.

         SECTION  11.7  Other   Dispositions.   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing
provisions of this  Article,  so long as an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be  continuing,  any amount  that would  otherwise  be payable to or for the
account of, or that would  otherwise  be retained  by,  Lessee  pursuant to this
Article shall be paid to Lessor as security for the  obligations of Lessee under
this  Lease  and,  at such  time  thereafter  as no  Event of  Default  shall be
continuing,  such  amount  shall be paid  promptly  to Lessee to the  extent not
previously  applied by Lessor in accordance  with the terms of this Lease or the
other Operative Documents.

         SECTION  11.8  No Rent  Abatement.  Basic  Rent,  Additional  Rent  and
Supplement Rent shall not abate  hereunder by reason of any Loss  (regardless of
whether such Loss constitutes a Total Loss, a Partial Loss or a Complete Taking)
with respect to the Leased  Property,  and Lessee shall  continue to perform and
fulfill  all  of  Lessee's  obligations,   covenants  and  agreements  hereunder
notwithstanding such Loss until the end of the Lease Term.

         SECTION 11.9  Purchase Option and Remarketing Option.

             (a) In the event of any Complete  Taking with respect to the Leased
Property, the Lessee and ADESA mayl, in the exercise of their discretion,  elect
at any time within thirty (30) days after the date of the  determination  by the
board of  directors  of ADESA that such Loss  constituted  a Complete  Taking by
giving written notice to the Lessor and the Trustee to either:

                         Period; and, provided,  that the Purchase Price for the
                         Leased  Property  shall be increased by an amount equal

                (ii)     exercise  of the  Remarketing  Option  provided  for in

                         except that for  purposes  of this  Section  11.9,  the
                         Option  Period shall be deemed to be the sixty (60) day
                         period  commencing  on the  date of such  determination
                         period and the one year period for  remarketing  of the

                         and,  provided,  that the Purchase Price for the Leased
                         Property  shall be  increased by an amount equal to the
                         applicable   Make  Whole  Amount  (as  defined  in  the
                         Indenture) that will, if any be incurred in

                                  ENFORCEMENT

         SECTION 14.1  Remedies.  Upon the  occurrence  of any Event of Default,
Lessor  may, so long as such Event of Default is  continuing,  do one or more of
the following as Lessor in its sole discretion shall determine, without limiting
any other right or remedy Lessor may have on account of such Event of Default.

             (a) Lessor  may,  by notice to Lessee,  rescind or  terminate  this
Lease as of the date specified in such notice;  provided,  however,  that (i) no
reletting, reentry or taking of possession of the Leased Property by Lessor will
be  construed as an election on Lessor's  part to terminate  this Lease unless a
written notice of such intention is given to Lessee,  (ii)  notwithstanding  any
reletting,  reentry or taking of possession,  Lessor may at any time  thereafter
elect to terminate this Lease for a continuing Event of Default and (iii) no act
or thing done by Lessor or any of its agents,  representatives  or employees and
no agreement  accepting a surrender of the Leased Property shall be valid unless
the same be made in writing and executed by Lessor.

             (b) Lessor may (i) demand that  Lessee,  and Lessee  shall upon the
written demand of Lessor,  return the Leased Property  promptly to Lessor in the
manner and condition  required by, and  otherwise in accordance  with all of the
provisions  of, this Lease hereof as if the Leased  Property were being returned
at  the  end of the  Lease  Term,  and  Lessor  shall  not  be  liable  for  the
reimbursement  of  Lessee  for any  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by Lessee in
connection therewith and (ii) without prejudice to any other remedy which Lessor
may have for  possession  of the Leased  Property,  and to the extent and in the
manner  permitted by  Applicable  law,  enter upon the Leased  Property and take
immediate  possession of (to the exclusion of Lessee) the Leased Property or any
part  thereof  and  expel or  remove  Lessee  and any  other  Person  who may be
occupying the Leased Property, by summary proceedings or otherwise,  all without
liability  to Lessee  for or by reason  of such  entry or taking of  possession,
whether  for the  restoration  of damage to  property  caused by such  taking or
otherwise  and,  in  addition  to  Lessor's  other  damages,   Lessee  shall  be
responsible  for the reasonable and documented  costs and expenses of reletting,
including   brokers  fees  and  the  reasonable  and  documented  costs  of  any
alterations or repairs made by Lessor.

             (c)  Lessor  may  sell all or any part of the  Leased  Property  at
public or private sale, as Lessor may determine, free and clear of any rights of
Lessee and without any duty to account to Lessee with  respect to such action in
inaction or any proceeds with respect thereto in which event Lessee's obligation
to pay Basic Rent hereunder for periods  commencing  after the date of such sale
shall be terminated or proportionately reduced, as the case may be.

             (d) Lessor may, at its option,  elect not to  terminate  the Lease,
and continue to collect all Basic Rent,  Additional Rent,  Supplemental Rent and
all other amounts due Lessor (together with all costs of collection) and enforce
Lessee's obligations under this Lease as and when the same become due, or are to
be performed,  and at the option of Lessor,  upon any  abandonment of the Leased
Property by Lessee or  re-entry  of same by Lessee,  Lessor may, in its sole and
absolute  discretion,  elect  not to  terminate  this  Lease  and may make  such
reasonable alterations and necessary

                                     18
<PAGE>
repairs in order to relet the Leased Property,  and relet the Leased Property or
any part thereof for such term or terms (which may be for a long term  extending
beyond the term of this Lease) and at such rental or rentals and upon such other
terms and conditions as Lessor in its reasonable  discretion may deem advisable.
Upon each such  reletting  all  rentals  actually  received  by Lessor from such
reletting  shall be applied to  Lessee's  obligations  hereunder  in such order,
proportion  and  priority  as Lessor  may elect in  Lessor's  sole and  absolute
discretion,  it being agreed that under no  circumstances  shall Lessee  benefit
from its default from any increase in market rents and if such rentals  received
from  such  reletting  during  any Rent  Period be less than the Rent to be paid
during that Rent Period by Lessee hereunder,  Lessee shall pay any deficiency to
Lessor on the Rent Payment Date in such Rent Period.

             (e)  Lessor  may  exercise  any other  right or remedy  that may be
available to it under  applicable  law, or proceed by  appropriate  court action
(legal or equitable)  to enforce the terms hereof or to recover  damages for the
breach  hereof.  Separate  suits may be brought to collect any such damages with
respect  to any Rent  Payment  Date,  and such  suits  shall  not in any  manner
prejudice  Lessor's  right to collect any such damages for any  subsequent  Rent
Payment  Date,  or Lessor may defer any such suit until after the  expiration of
the Lease  Term,  in which  event such suit shall be deemed not to have  accrued
until the expiration of the Lease Term.

             (f) Lessor may retain and apply against  Lessor's  damages all sums
which Lessor  would,  absent such Event of Default,  be required to pay, or turn
over, to Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Lease.

         SECTION 14.2 Remedies Cumulative;  No Waiver;  Consents.  To the extent
permitted by, and subject to the mandatory requirements of, applicable law, each
and  every  right  power  and  remedy  herein  specifically  given to  Lessor or
otherwise  in this Lease shall be  cumulative  and shall be in addition to every
other  right,  power and remedy  herein  specifically  given or now or hereafter
existing at law, in equity or by statute,  and each and every  right,  power and
remedy whether  specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised
from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed  expedient  by
Lessor, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy
shall not be  construed to be a wavier of the right to exercise at the same time
or thereafter any right,  power or remedy. No delay or omission by Lessor in the
exercise  of any right,  power or remedy or in the  pursuit of any remedy  shall
impair any such  right,  power or remedy or be  construed  to be a waiver of any
default on the part of Lessee or to be an acquiescence therein. Lessor's consent
to any request made by Lessee shall not be deemed to  constitute or preclude the
necessity  for  obtaining  Lessor's  consent,  in the  future,  to  all  similar
requests.  No express or implied  waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default shall
in any way be,  or be  construed  to be, a wavier of any  future  or  subsequent
Potential  Event of Default or Event of  Default.  To the  extent  permitted  by
applicable  law,  Lessee hereby waives any rights now or hereafter  conferred by
statute or otherwise that may require Lessor to sell, lease or otherwise use the
Leased  Property or part  thereof in  mitigation  of Lessor's  damages  upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or that may  otherwise  limit or modify any of
Lessor's rights or remedies under this Article.

                          RIGHT TO PERFORM FOR LESSEE

         If Lessee  shall fail to perform or comply  with any of its  agreements
contained  herein,  Lessor may, on thirty (30) days prior notice (or such lesser
period  afforded by  Applicable  laws or any third party) to Lessee,  perform or
comply  with such  agreement,  and  Lessor  shall not  thereby be deemed to have
waived any default  caused by such  failure,  and the amount of such payment and
the amount of the expenses of Lessor (including  reasonable  attorney's fees and
expenses)  incurred in  connection  with such payment or the  performance  of or
compliance with such agreement, as the case may be, shall be deemed Supplemental
Rent,  payable by Lessee to Lessor  within ten (10) days  after  written  demand
therefor.

respective  successors and assigns  (collectively,  the "Tax  Indemnitees,"  and

                         Applicable law occurring  after the Closing Date or (2)
                         on Rent,  to the extent  the net  payment of Rent after
                         deduction of such withholding  Taxes would be less than
                         amounts  currently payable with respect to the Note and
                         (C) any  increase  in any  franchise  taxes based on or

                         Indemnitee,  to the extent  that such tax  increase  or
                         decrease would not have occurred if on the Closing Date
                         the Lessor had advanced funds to the Lessee in the form
                         of a loan  secured by the Leased  Property in an amount
                         equal to the  Loan,  with  debt  service  for such loan

                         capital  stock,  net worth,  or  mercantile  license or
                         similar taxes other than (A) any increase in such Taxes
                         imposed  on  such  Tax   Indemnitee  by  the  State  of
                         Tennessee,  net  of any  decrease  in  any  such  taxes
                         realized  by such Tax  Indemnitee,  to the extent  that
                         such tax increase or decrease  would not have  occurred
                         if on the Closing Date the Lessor had advanced funds to
                         the Lessee in the form of a loan  secured by the Leased
                         Property  in an  amount  equal to the  Loan,  with debt
                         service  for such loan equal to the Basic Rent  payable
                         on each Rent  Payment  Date and a principal  balance at
                         the  maturity  of such loan in an  amount  equal to the
                         Loan at the end of the Lease Term or (B) any Taxes that
                         are or are in the nature of sales, use, rental, license
                         or property Taxes;

               (iii)     Taxes that result from any act,  event or omission,  or
                         are  attributable  to any period of time,  that  occurs
                         after the earliest of (A) the  expiration  of the Lease
                         Term with respect to the Leased Property and,

<PAGE>


                         if the Leased  Property  is  required to be returned to
                         the Lessor in  accordance  with the Lease,  such return
                         and  (B)  the   discharge   in  full  of  the  Lessee's
                         obligations  to pay the Funded  Purchase Price Balance,

                         respect to the Leased  Property  and all other  amounts
                         due under the Lease,  unless such Taxes relate to acts,
                         events or matters  occurring  prior to the  earliest of
                         such  times or are  imposed  on or with  respect to any
                         payments due under the Operative  Documents  after such
                         expiration or discharge;

                (iv)     Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee  that result from any
                         voluntary   sale,   assignment,   transfer   or   other
                         disposition  by such Tax  Indemnitee or any related Tax
                         Indemnitee  of any  interest in the Leased  Property or
                         any  part  thereof,  or  any  interest  therein  or any
                         interest  or  obligation  arising  under the  Operative
                         Documents  or from any sale,  assignment,  transfer  or
                         other   disposition   of  any   interest  in  such  Tax
                         Indemnitee  or any  related  Tax  Indemnitee,  it being
                         understood  that  each of the  following  shall  not be
                         considered  a  voluntary  sale:  (A) any  substitution,
                         replacement  or removal of any of the  property  by the
                         Lessee  shall not be treated as a  voluntary  action of
                         any Tax Indemnitee,  (B) any sale or transfer resulting
                         from the  exercise  by the  Lessee  of any  termination
                         option, any purchase option or sale option (C) any sale
                         or  transfer  while  an  Event of  Default  shall  have
                         occurred and be continuing  under the Lease and (D) any
                         sale or transfer  resulting from the Lessor's  exercise
                         of remedies under the Lease;

                 (v)     any Tax which is being  contested  in good faith by the
                         Lessee or ADESA during the pendency of such contest;

                (vi)     any Tax that is imposed on a Tax Indemnitee as a result
                         of such Tax  Indemnitee's  gross  negligence or willful
                         misconduct  (other  than  gross  negligence  or willful
                         misconduct  imputed to the Lessor or the Lender  solely
                         by reason of their  respective  interests in the Leased
                         Property);

               (vii)     any Tax that  results from a Tax  Indemnitee  engaging,
                         with respect to the Leased  Property,  in  transactions
                         other than those permitted by the Operative  Documents;
                         or

              (viii)     to the extent any  interest,  penalties or additions to
                         tax  result in whole or in part from the  failure  of a
                         Tax  Indemnitee to file a return that it is required to
                         file in a proper and timely manner, unless such failure
                         (A) results from the  transactions  contemplated by the
                         Operative  Documents in circumstances  where the Lessee
                         did not give timely

                                     22
<PAGE>

                         notice  to  Lessor  (and the  Lessor  otherwise  had no
                         actual knowledge) of such filing requirement that would
                         have  permitted  a proper  and  timely  filing  of such
                         return or (B) results from the failure of the Lessee to
                         supply information  necessary for the proper and timely
                         filing of such return that was not in the possession of
                         the Lessor.

         SECTION  16.3  Procedures.  If any claim shall be made  against any Tax
Indemnitee or if any  proceeding  shall be commenced  against any Tax Indemnitee
(including a written  notice of such  proceeding)  for any Taxes as to which the
Lessee may have an indemnity  obligation pursuant to this Section, or if any Tax
Indemnitee  shall  determine  that any Taxes as to which the  Lessee may have an
indemnity  obligation  pursuant  to  this  Section  may  be  payable,  such  Tax
Indemnitee  shall promptly notify the Lessee.  The Lessee shall be entitled,  at
its expense,  to  participate  in and to the extent that the Lessee  desires to,
assume and control the defense thereof; provided, however, that the Lessee shall
have  acknowledged in writing if the contest is  unsuccessful  its obligation to
fully  indemnify  such  Tax  Indemnitee  in  respect  of  such  action,  suit or
proceeding;  and  provided,  further,  that the Lessee  shall not be entitled to
assume and control the defense of any such action,  suit or proceeding  (but the
Tax Indemnitee  shall then contest,  at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee,
on behalf of the Lessee) if and to the extent that (A) in the reasonable opinion
of such Tax Indemnitee,  such action, suit or proceeding involves any meaningful
risk of imposition of criminal  liability or any material risk of material civil
liability on such Tax  Indemnitee  or will involve a material  risk of the sale,
forfeiture or loss, or the creation,  of any Lien (other than a Permitted  Lien)
on the Leased Property or any part thereof unless the Lessee shall have posted a
bond or other security  satisfactory  to the relevant Tax Indemnities in respect
to such risk, (B) such proceeding  involves Claims not fully  indemnified by the
Lessee  which the Lessee and the Tax  Indemnitee  have been unable to sever from
the  indemnified  Claim(s),  (C)  an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and  is
continuing,  (D) such action,  suit or proceeding  involves matters which extend
beyond  or are  unrelated  to the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Operative
Documents and if determined  adversely  could be materially  detrimental  to the
interests of such Tax Indemnitee  notwithstanding  indemnification by the Lessee
or (E) such action,  suit or proceeding involves the federal or any state income
tax liability of the Tax Indemnitee.  With respect to any contests controlled by
a Tax Indemnitee, (i) if such contest relates to the federal or any state income
tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee,  such Tax Indemnitee  shall be required to
conduct  such  contest  only if the  Lessee  shall  have  provided  to such  Tax
Indemnitee an opinion of independent tax counsel  selected by the Tax Indemnitee
and reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee stating that a reasonable basis exists
to  contest  such  claim  or  (ii)  in  the  case  of an  appeal  of an  adverse
determination  of any contest  relating to any Taxes, an opinion of such counsel
to the  effect  that  such  appeal  is more  likely  than not to be  successful;
provided,  however,  such Tax Indemnitee shall in no event be required to appeal
an adverse  determination to the United States Supreme Court. The Tax Indemnitee
may  participate  in a  reasonable  manner at its own  expense  and with its own
counsel  in any  proceeding  conducted  by the  Lessee  in  accordance  with the
foregoing.  Each Tax Indemnitee  shall at the Lessee's expense supply the Lessee
with such  information,  documents  and  testimony  reasonably  requested by the
Lessee as are  necessary  or  advisable  for the  Lessee to  participate  in any
action,  suit or proceeding to the extent  permitted by this Section.  Unless an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,  no Tax Indemnitee shall
enter into any settlement or other compromise with

                                     23
<PAGE>

respect to any Claim  which is  entitled to be  indemnified  under this  Section
without the prior  written  consent of the Lessee,  which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably  withheld,  unless  such  Tax  Indemnitee  waives  its  right to be
indemnified  under this  Section  with  respect to such  Claim.  Notwithstanding
anything  contained  herein to the contrary,  (i) a Tax  Indemnitee  will not be
required to contest  (and the Lessee  shall not be permitted to contest) a claim
with respect to the imposition of any Tax if such Tax Indemnitee shall waive its
right to indemnification  under this Section with respect to such claim (and any
related  claim  with  respect  to other  taxable  years the  contest of which is
precluded  as a  result  of such  waiver)  and (ii) no Tax  Indemnitee  shall be
required  to  contest  any claim if the  subject  matter  thereof  shall be of a
continuing nature and shall have previously been decided adversely, unless there
has been a change in law which in the opinion of the  Lessee's  counsel  creates
substantial  authority for the success of such contest.  Each Tax Indemnitee and
the Lessee shall consult in good faith with each other  regarding the conduct of
such contest controlled by either.

         SECTION 16.4 Credits and Refunds.  If (i) a Tax Indemnitee shall obtain
a credit or refund of any Taxes paid by the Lessee  pursuant to this  Section or
(ii) by  reason  of the  incurrence  or  imposition  of any Tax for  which a Tax
Indemnitee is indemnified hereunder or any payment made to or for the account of
such Tax Indemnitee by the Lessee pursuant to this Section,  such Tax Indemnitee
at any time  realizes  a  reduction  in any Taxes  for  which the  Lessee is not
required  to  indemnify  such Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant to this  Section,  which
reduction in Taxes was not taken into  account in computing  such payment by the
Lessee to or for the account of such Tax  Indemnitee,  then such Tax  Indemnitee
shall  promptly pay to the Lessee the amount of such credit or refund,  together
with the amount of any interest  received by such Tax  Indemnitee  on account of
such credit or refund or an amount equal to such reduction in Taxes, as the case
may be;  provided,  however,  that no such  payment  shall be made so long as an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;  and provided,  further,
that the amount  payable to the Lessee by any Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant  to this
subsection  shall not at any time exceed the  aggregate  amount of all indemnity
payments  made by the Lessee under this Section to such Tax  Indemnitee  and all
related Tax Indemnities with respect to the Taxes which gave rise to a credit or
refund or with  respect to the Tax which gave rise to a reduction  in Taxes less
the amount of all prior  payments made to the Lessee by such Tax  Indemnitee and
related Tax Indemnities under this Section. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to act in
good faith to claim such refunds and other available Tax benefits, and take such
other  actions as may be  reasonable to minimize any payment due from the Lessee
pursuant to this Section and to maximize the amount of any Tax savings available
to it. The disallowance or reduction of any credit,  refund or other tax savings
with  respect to which a Tax  Indemnitee  has made a payment to the Lessee under
this  subsection  shall be treated as a Tax for which the Lessee is obligated to
indemnify such Tax Indemnitee hereunder.

         SECTION 16.5 Payments.  Any Tax indemnifiable  under this Section shall
be paid directly when due to the applicable  taxing  authority if direct payment
is  practicable  and  permitted.  If direct  payment  to the  applicable  taxing
authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made, any amount payable to a Tax
Indemnitee  pursuant to this Section shall be paid within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written demand  therefor from such Tax Indemnitee  accompanied by a
written statement describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable, but not
before the date that the relevant Taxes

                                     24
<PAGE>
are due. Any payments  made  pursuant to this Section  shall be made directly to
the Tax  Indemnitee  entitled  thereto  or the  Lessor,  as the case may be,  in
immediately  available funds at such bank or to such account as specified by the
payee in written  directions to the payor,  or, if no such direction  shall have
been given, by check of the payor payable to the order of the payee by certified
mail,  postage prepaid at its address as set forth in this  Agreement.  Upon the
request of any Tax Indemnitee  with respect to a Tax that the Lessee is required
to pay,  the Lessee  shall  furnish to such Tax  Indemnitee  the  original  or a
certified  copy of a receipt  for  Lessee's  payment  of such Tax or such  other
evidence of payment as is reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee.

         SECTION 16.6 Reports,  Returns and  Statements.  If the Lessee knows of
any report,  return or statement  required to be filed with respect to any Taxes
that are subject to indemnification under this Section, the Lessee shall, if the
Lessee is  permitted  by  Applicable  law,  timely file such  report,  return or
statement  (and, to the extent  permitted by law,  show  ownership of the Leased
Property in the Lessee); provided,  however, that if the Lessee is not permitted
by Applicable  law or does not have access to the  information  required to file
any such  report,  return or  statement  the Lessee will  promptly so notify the
appropriate Tax Indemnitee,  in which case Tax Indemnitee will file such report.
In any case in which the Tax  Indemnitee  will file any such  report,  return or
statement,  Lessee shall,  upon written request of such Tax Indemnitee,  provide
such Tax  Indemnitee  with such  information  as is reasonably  available to the
Lessee.

                                 ARTICLE XVII
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 17.1 Reports.  To the extent required under  applicable law and
to the  extent it is  reasonably  practical  for Lessee to do so,  Lessee  shall
prepare and file in timely fashion, or, where such filing is required to be made
by Lessor or it is otherwise  not  reasonably  practical for Lessee to make such
filing,  Lessee shall  prepare and deliver to Lessor (with a copy to the Lender)
within a reasonable time prior to the date for filing and Lessor shall file, any
material  reports  with  respect to the  condition  or  operation  of the Leased
Property that shall be required to be filed with any governmental authority.

         SECTION 17.2 Binding  Effect;  Successors  and Assigns;  Survival.  The
terms and provisions of this Lease,  and the respective  rights and  obligations
hereunder  of  Lessor  and  Lessee,  shall  be  binding  upon  their  respective
successors, legal representatives and assigns (including, in the case of Lessor,
any Person to whom  Lessor may  transfer  the Leased  Property  or any  interest
therein in accordance with the provisions of the Operative Documents), and inure
to the benefit of their  respective  permitted  successors and assigns,  and the
rights  hereunder of the Trustee shall inure (subject to such  conditions as are
contained  herein) to the  benefit of the  Trustee's  permitted  successors  and
assigns.

         SECTION 17.3 Quiet  Enjoyment.  Lessor  covenants  that,  so long as no
Event of Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  it will not  interfere  in
Lessee's or any of its  sublessees'  quiet  enjoyment of the Leased  Property in
accordance with this Lease during the Lease Term. Such right

                                     25
<PAGE>


of quiet  enjoyment is  independent  of, and shall not affect,  Lessor's  rights
otherwise to initiate  legal action to enforce the  obligations  of Lessee under
this Lease.

         SECTION 17.4 Notices.  Unless otherwise  specified herein, all notices,
offers,   acceptances,   rejections,   consents,   requests,  demands  or  other
communications  to or upon the  respective  parties hereto shall be given in the
manner provided for in the Note Purchase Agreement.

         SECTION 17.5  Severability.  Any  provision of this Lease that shall be
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof  and any  such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction,  and Lessee shall remain
liable  to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  except  to the  extent of such
unenforceability.  To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  Lessee  hereby
waives any  provision of law that renders any  provision  hereof  prohibited  or
unenforceable in any respect.

         SECTION 17.6 Amendment; Complete Agreements. Neither this Lease nor any
of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived or modified
orally,  except by an  instrument  in  writing  signed by Lessor  and Lessee and
approved  by ADESA and by the  Trustee as provided  for in the  Indenture.  This
Lease,  together with the other Operative Documents,  is intended by the parties
as a final  expression of their lease  agreement and as a complete and exclusive
statement  of  the  terms  thereof,   all   negotiations,   considerations   and
representations between the parties having been incorporated herein and therein.
No course of prior dealings  between the parties or their  officers,  employees,
agents or Affiliates shall be relevant or admissible to supplement,  explain, or
vary any of the terms of this Lease or any other Operative Document.  Acceptance
of, or acquiescence in, a course of performance rendered under this or any prior
agreement  between  the  parties or their  Affiliates  shall not be  relevant or
admissible  to  determine  the  meaning of any of the terms of this Lease or any
other Operative Document.  No  representations,  undertakings or agreements have
been  made or  relied  upon  in the  making  of  this  Lease  other  than  those
specifically set forth in the Operative Documents.

         SECTION  17.7  Construction.  This Lease  shall not be  construed  more
strictly  against any one party,  it being  recognized  that both of the Parties
hereto have  contributed  substantially  and materially to the  preparation  and
negotiation of this Lease.

         SECTION  17.8  Headings.  The Table of  Contents  and  headings  of the
various  Articles  and Sections of this Lease are for  convenience  of reference
only and shall  not  modify,  define  or limit  any of the  terms or  provisions
hereof.

         SECTION  17.9  Counterparts.  This Lease may be executed by the parties
hereto in separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed and  delivered
shall be an original,  but all such counterparts  shall together  constitute but
one and the same instrument.

                                     26
<PAGE>
         SECTION  17.10  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS  LEASE  SHALL  IN ALL RESPECTS BE
GOVERNED  BY,  AND  CONSTRUED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE  LAWS OF THE  STATE OF
TENNESSEE APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH
STATE,  INCLUDING  ALL  MATTERS  OF  CONSTRUCTION,  VALIDITY,  PERFORMANCE,  THE
CREATION  OF THE  LEASEHOLD  ESTATE  HEREUNDER  AND THE  EXERCISE  OF RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ESTATE.

         SECTION  17.11  Discharge  of  Lessee's Obligations  by its Affiliates.
Lessor agrees that performance of any of Lessee's  obligations  hereunder by one
or more of  Lessee's  Affiliates  or one or more of Lessee's  sublessees  of the
Leased  Property or any part thereof shall  constitute  performance by Lessee of
such  obligations  to the same extent and with the same effect  hereunder  as if
such obligations were performed by Lessee,  but no such performance shall excuse
Lessee  from any  obligation  not  performed  by it or on its  behalf  under the
Operative Documents.

         SECTION 17.12  Liability of Lessor Limited. Except as otherwise 
expressly provided below in this Section, it is expressly  understood and agreed
by and between Lessee,  Lessor and their respective  successors and assigns that
nothing herein  contained shall be construed as creating any liability of Lessor
or any of  its  Affiliates  or any  of  their  respective  officers,  directors,
employees or agents, individually or personally, to perform any covenant, either
express  or  implied,  contained  herein,  all  such  liability,  if any,  being
expressly  waived  by  Lessee  and by each and  every  Person  now or  hereafter
claiming by,  through or under  Lessee and that,  so far as Lessor or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,  employees or agents,
individually  or personally,  is concerned,  Lessee and any Person  claiming by,
through or under  Lessee  shall look solely to the right,  title and interest of
Lessor in the Leased Property and any proceeds from Lessor's sale or encumbrance
thereof or the  Additional  Rent  (provided,  however,  that Lessee shall not be
entitled to any double  recovery) for the  performance of any  obligation  under
this  Lease  and under  the  Operative  Documents  and the  satisfaction  of any
liability arising therefrom.

         SECTION 17.13  Estoppel Certificates. Each party hereto agrees that any
time and from time to time during the Lease Term,  it will  promptly,  but in no
event  later than  thirty  (30) days after  request by the other  party  hereto,
execute,  acknowledge  and  deliver to such other  party or to the  Lender,  any
prospective  purchaser (if such prospective purchaser has signed a commitment or
letter of intent to purchase the Leased Property or any part thereof),  assignee
or  mortgagee  or third party  designated  by such other  party,  a  certificate
stating (i) that this Lease is  unmodified  and in force and effect (or if there
have been modifications, that this Lease is in force and effect as modified, and
identifying the modification agreements),  (ii) the date to which Basic Rent and
Additional  Rent has been  paid,  (iii)  whether  or not  there is any  existing
default by Lessee in the payment of Basic Rent and Additional  Rent or any other
sum of money  hereunder,  and whether or not there is any other existing default
by either  party with  respect to which a notice of default has been served and,
if there is any such default,  specifying  the nature and extent  thereof,  (iv)
whether  or  not,  to  the  knowledge  of  the  signer  after  due  inquiry  and
investigation, there are any setoffs, defenses or counterclaims

                                     27
<PAGE>

against  enforcement of the  obligations to be performed  hereunder  existing in
favor of the party  executing such  certificate  and (v) other items that may be
reasonably  requested;  provided,  however,  that  no  such  certificate  may be
requested unless the requesting party has a good faith reason for such request.

         SECTION 17.14  No Joint Venture. Any intention to create a joint
venture or  partnership   relation   between  Lessor  and  Lessee  is  hereby  
expressly disclaimed.

         SECTION  17.15  No Accord and Satisfaction. The acceptance by Lessor of
any sums from Lessee  (whether as Basic Rent or  otherwise) in amounts which are
less than the amounts due and payable by Lessee  hereunder is not intended,  nor
shall any such acceptance be construed, to constitute an accord and satisfaction
of any  dispute  between  Lessor and Lessee  regarding  sums due and  payable by
Lessee hereunder, unless Lessor specifically deems it as such in writing.

         SECTION  17.16  No Merger.  In no event  shall the leasehold  interest,
estates  or rights of Lessee  hereunder  merge  with any  interests,  estates or
rights of Lessor in or to the Leased  Property,  it being  understood  that such
leasehold  interests,  estates and rights of Lessee hereunder shall be deemed to
be separate and distinct  from Lessor's  interests,  estates and rights in or to
the Leased Property,  notwithstanding that any such interests, estates or rights
shall at any time or times be held by or vested in the same person,  corporation
or other entity.

         SECTION 17.17  Survival. The obligations of Lessee to be performed
under  this  Lease  prior  to the  Lease  Termination  Date  shall  survive  the
expiration or termination of this Lease. The extension of any applicable statute
of  limitations  by  Lessor,  Lessee or any  Indemnitee  shall not  affect  such
survival.

         SECTION  17.18  Prior Mortgages. This Lease is and shall be subject and
subordinate  to that certain Deed of Trust and Security  Agreement,  dated as of
November  22, 1994,  by Lessor in favor of John A. Gupton,  III, as trustee (the
"Local  Trustee"),  for the benefit of the Trustee  and  encumbering  the Leased
Property, and to all rights of the Local Trustee and the Trustee thereunder, and
to  all  renewals,   modifications,   consolidations,   amendments,   increases,
replacements and extensions thereof ("Mortgage").

         Lessee  agrees to  perform  all of the  obligations  of Lessor  (in its
capacity  as grantor)  set forth in the  Mortgage,  insofar as such  obligations
relate,  directly or  indirectly,  to the Leased  Property,  whether or not such
obligations  are more onerous than the  obligations  imposed upon Lessee by this
Lease.

         Whenever any provision of this Lease requires any consent,  approval or
agreement  of the  Lessor,  such  requirement  shall be  deemed to  include  the
consent, approval or agreement of the Trustee, so long as the Mortgage shall not
have been discharged.

         SECTION 17.19  Time of Essence.  Time is of the essence of this Lease.

                                     28
<PAGE>


         SECTION 17.20  Recordation of Lease. Lessee will, at its expense, cause
a Memorandum  of this Lease and the Purchase Option to be recorded in the proper
office or offices in the State of Tennessee  and the  municipality  in which the
Land is located.

PROPERTY,  OR ANY PART THEREOF,  TO COMPLY WITH ANY  APPLICABLE  LAW. As between
Lessor and Lessee,  Lessee has been  afforded  full  opportunity  to inspect the
Land,  is  satisfied  with the  results  of its  inspections  of the Land and is
entering  into  this  Lease  solely  on the  basis  of the  results  of its  own
inspections and all risks incident to the matters discussed in the two preceding
sentences, as between Lessor or the Trustee, on the one hand, and Lessee, on the
other,  are to be borne by Lessee.  The  provisions  of this  Article  have been
negotiated and, except to the extent otherwise  expressly stated,  the foregoing
provisions  are  intended  to  be a  complete  exclusion  and  negation  of  any
representations or warranties by Lessor or the Trustee, express or implied, with
respect  to the  Leased  Property  that  may  arise  pursuant  to any law now or
hereafter in effect or otherwise.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                      LIENS; EASEMENTS; PARTIAL CONVEYANCES

         Commencing on the date that  Construction  is completed and thereafter,
Lessee  shall not  directly  or  indirectly  create,  incur or assume,  any lien
encumbrance or security interest on or with respect to the Leased Property,  the
Construction,  title thereto,  or any interest  therein  ("Lien")  including any
Liens which arise out of the possession, use, occupancy, construction, repair or
rebuilding of the Leased  Property or by reason of labor or materials  furnished
or claimed to have been furnished to Lessee, or any of its contractors or agents
or by reason of the financing of any personalty or equipment purchased or leased
by Lessee or Alterations  constructed by Lessee,  except in all cases  Permitted
Exceptions.

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  paragraph,  at the  request of Lessee,
Lessor  shall,  from  time to time  during  the Lease  Term and upon  reasonable
advance written notice from Lessee and receipt of the materials specified in the
next  succeeding  sentence,  consent to and join in any (i) grant of  easements,
licenses, rights of way and other rights in the nature of easements,  including,
without limitation,  utility easements to facilitate  Lessee's use,  development
and  construction  of the  Leased  Property,  (ii)  release  or  termination  of
easements,  licenses,  rights of way or other  rights in the nature of easements
which are for the benefit of the Land or the Improvement or any portion thereof,
(iii)  dedication  or  transfer of portions  of the Land,  not  improved  with a
building,  for  road,  highway  or other  public  purposes,  (iv)  execution  of
agreements   for  ingress  and  egress  and  amendments  to  any  covenants  and
restrictions  affecting the Land or the  Improvement or any portion  thereof and
(v)  request to any  governmental  authority  for  platting  or  subdivision  or
replotting  or  resubdivision  approval  with respect to the Land or any portion
thereof or any parcel of land of which the Land or any portion  thereof  forms a
part  or  a  request  for  any  variance  from  zoning  or  other   governmental
requirements.  Lessor's  obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
subject to the requirements that:

                           (i)      any such  action  shall be at the sole  cost
                                    and  expense of Lessee and Lessee  shall pay
                                    all reasonable and documented  out-of-pocket
                                    costs  of  Lessor  in  connection  therewith
                                    (including,    without    limitation,    the
                                    reasonable and documented fees of attorneys,
                                    architects, engineers,

                                    with any such action);

                           (ii)     Lessee  shall  have  delivered  to  Lessor a
                                    certificate of the Chief  Financial  Officer
                                    of Lessee  stating that (1) such action will
                                    not cause the Land or the Improvement or any
                                    portion  thereof  to fail to  comply  in any
                                    respect with the  provisions of the Lease or
                                    any  other  Operative  Documents  or in  any
                                    respect  with  applicable  law and (2)  such
                                    action will not  materially  reduce the fair
                                    market sales  value,  utility or useful life
                                    of the Land or the  Improvement nor Lessor's
                                    interest therein

                           (iii)    any  consideration  received  in  connection
                                    with  any  such  action  shall  be  paid  as
                                    provided for in the Indenture; and

                           (iv)     in the case of any release or conveyance, if
                                    Lessor so requests,  Lessee will cause to be
                                    issued and  delivered to Lessor by the Title
                                    Insurance  Company  an  endorsement  to  the
                                    Title  Policy  pursuant  to which  the Title
                                    Insurance  Company agrees that its liability
                                    for the payment of any loss or damage  under
                                    the terms and provisions of the Title Policy
                                    will not be  affected  by reason of the fact
                                    that a portion of the real property referred
                                    to in  Schedule  A of the Title  Policy  has
                                    been released or conveyed by Lessor.


                                   ARTICLE VII
                             MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR;
                    ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS

         SECTION 7.1 Maintenance and Repair; Compliance With Law. Lessee, at its
own expense,  shall at all times (i) maintain the Leased Property in good repair
and condition  (subject to ordinary wear and tear),  in accordance  with prudent
industry  standards  and,  in any  event,  in no less a manner as other  similar
automobile auction facilities owned or leased by ADESA,  Lessee or ADESA's other
subsidiaries,  (ii)  make all  alterations  in  accordance  with,  and  maintain
(whether  or  not  such  maintenance   requires   structural   modifications  or
alterations)  and operate and otherwise  keep the Leased  Property in compliance
with, all applicable laws and (iii) make all material repairs,  replacements and
renewals  of the Leased  Property or any part  thereof  which may be required to
keep the Leased Property in the condition  required by the preceding clauses (i)
and (ii). Lessee shall perform the foregoing maintenance  obligations regardless
of whether the Leased  Property is occupied  or  unoccupied.  Lessee  waives any
right  that it may now  have or  hereafter  acquire  to (i)  require  Lessor  to
maintain,  repair,  replace,  alter,  remove or  rebuild  all or any part of the
Leased  Property or (ii) make  repairs at the expense of Lessor  pursuant to any
applicable law or other  agreements or otherwise.  Lessor shall not be liable to
Lessee or to any contractors,  subcontractors,  laborers, materialmen, suppliers
or vendors for services performed or material provided on or in connection

                                       8

with the Leased  Property or any part  thereof.  Lessor shall not be required to
maintain, alter, repair, rebuild or replace the Leased Property in any way.

SECTION 7.2 Alterations.  Lessee may, without the consent of Lessor, at Lessee's
own cost and expense,  make alterations  which, in the reasonable opinion of the
chief  executive  officer of  Lessee,  do not  diminish  the value of the Leased
Property.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                       USE

         Lessee  shall use the Leased  Property or any part thereof only for the
purpose of used automobile  auction  business capable of operating not less than
the  number  of  simultaneous   auction  lines  anticipated  in  the  Plans  and
Specifications, together with related or ancillary businesses including, without
limitation, automobile storage, repair and preparation,  transportation,  direct
sales or other businesses related to used automobile auctions.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                    INSURANCE

                  (a) During the  Construction  and at any time during which any
part of the  Improvement or any Alteration is under  construction  and as to any
part of the  Improvement  or any  Alteration  under  construction,  Lessee shall
maintain,  at its sole cost and  expense,  as a part of its blanket  policies or
otherwise,  "all risks"  nonreporting  completed  value form of  builder's  risk
insurance,  which  insurance and policies shall, in each case, be in the amounts
and otherwise be consistent  with any applicable  requirements  set forth in the
Note Purchase Agreement, Indenture or Mortgage.

                  (b) Following the  Completion of the  Construction  and at all
times thereafter during the Lease Term, Lessee shall maintain,  at its sole cost
and expense,  as a part of its blanket policies or otherwise,  insurance against
loss  or  damage  to  the  Improvement  by  fire  and  other  risks,   including
comprehensive  boiler and  machinery  coverage,  on terms and in amounts no less
favorable than insurance  covering other similar  properties owned by the Lessee
and that are in accordance with normal industry  practice,  but in no event less
than the  coverage in place on the date  hereof,  which  insurance  and policies
shall,  in each case,  be in the amounts and  otherwise be  consistent  with any
applicable  requirements set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement,  Indenture or
Mortgage.

                  (c) During the Lease Term, Lessee shall maintain,  at its sole
cost and expense,  commercial  general  liability  insurance,  as is  ordinarily
procured by Persons who own or operate  similar  properties  in the same market,
which  insurance  and  policies  shall,  in each  case,  be in the  amounts  and
otherwise be consistent with any applicable  requirements  set forth in the Note
Purchase Agreement,  Indenture or Mortgage. Such insurance shall be on terms and
in amounts that are no less favorable  than insurance  maintained by Lessee with
respect to similar properties that it owns and that

                                       9

<PAGE>

are in accordance with normal industry  practice,  but in no event less than the
coverage  (including  types  and  amounts)  in place on the  date  hereof.  Such
insurance   policies  shall  also  provide  that  Lessee's  insurance  shall  be
considered primary insurance. Nothing in this Article shall prohibit Lessor from
carrying at its own expense  other  insurance  on or with  respect to the Leased
Property;  provided,  however,  that any  insurance  carried by Lessor shall not
prevent Lessee from carrying the insurance required hereby.

                  (d) Each policy of insurance  maintained by Lessee pursuant to
clauses (a) and (b) of this Article shall provide that all Casualty Proceeds (as
defined and provided for in the  Indenture)  shall be payable to the Trustee for
deposit and disbursement as provided for in Section 6.3 of the Indenture.

                  (e) Within  thirty  (30) days after the date hereof and within
thirty (30) days after the date upon which the Construction is completed, Lessee
shall  furnish  Lessor and the Trustee with  certificates  showing the insurance
required under this Article to be in effect and naming Lessor and the Trustee as
additional insureds. Such certificates shall include a provision for thirty (30)
days'  advance  written  notice by the  insurer to Lessor and the Trustee in the
event of  cancellation  or  expiration  or nonpayment of premium with respect to
such insurance, and shall include a customary breach of warranty clause.

                  (f) Each policy of insurance  maintained by Lessee pursuant to
this  Article  shall (i) contain the waiver of any right of  subrogation  of the
insurer  against  Lessor and the Trustee and (ii) provide that in respect of the
interests of Lessor and the Trustee,  such policies  shall not be invalidated by
any fraud or misrepresentation of lessee or any other Person acting on behalf of
Lessee.

                  (g) On and after  January  1,  1996,  all  insurance  policies
carried in accordance  with this Article shall be maintained with insurers rated
at the inception of such  policies at least "A" by A.M.  Best & Company,  and in
all cases the insurer  shall be  qualified to insure risks in the State of North
Carolina.

                                    ARTICLE X
                            ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASING

         Lessee may not assign any of its  right,  title or  interest  in, to or
under this Lease. Lessee may sublease all or any portion of the Leased Property;
provided,  however,  that (i) all  obligations  of Lessee shall continue in full
effect as obligations of a principal and not of a guarantor or surety, as though
no sublease had been made,  (ii) such  sublease  shall be expressly  subject and
subordinate to this Lease,  the Indenture,  the Mortgage and the other Operative
Documents and (iii) each such sublease shall terminate on or before the last day
of the Lease Term. Except as provided for in the Indenture, this Lease shall not
be  mortgaged  or pledged by Lessee,  nor shall  Lessee  mortgage  or pledge any
interest in the Leased  Property or any portion  thereof.  Any such  mortgage or
pledge shall be void.

                    LOSS, DESTRUCTION, CONDEMNATION OR DAMAGE

         SECTION 11.1 Available Proceeds. All Casualty Proceeds and Condemnation
Awards (both as defined in the Indenture,  and which are collectively defined in
the Indenture as "Available Proceeds") shall be remitted and paid to the Trustee
by the Lessee,  the Lessor or ADESA, as applicable,  for deposit in the Casualty
Account (as defined and established under the Indenture) for  disbursement,  all
as provided for in Section 6.3 of the Indenture.  Until such time as the Lessee,
the Lessor,  ADESA or any of their  respective  agents or  representatives  have
remitted and paid any Available Proceeds to the Trustee,  such Person shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the benefit of the Trustee.  In the event that at any
time during the Lease Term, the Indenture has been terminated, the Lessor shall,
for purposes of this Article,  be treated as the Trustee,  and shall deposit and
disburse any  Available  Proceeds in  substantially  the manner  provided for in
Section 6.3 of the Indenture as if it were the Trustee.

         SECTION 11.2 Repairs and Restoration. In the event of any Total Loss or
Partial Loss (collectively,  "Loss"), other than a Total Loss which, in the good
faith judgment of the chief  executive  officer of Lessee renders the repair and
restoration  of the  Leased  Property  impractical  or  uneconomical  including,
without  limitation,  any  condemnation of the Leased Property  resulting in the
taking of all or  substantially  all of the  Leased  Property  (collectively,  a
"Complete Taking"), then:

                           (i)      the  Lessee  and  ADESA  shall   repair  and
                                    restore  the Leased  Property  such that the
                                    Leased  Property as so repaired and restored
                                    is, in the good faith  judgment of the chief
                                    executive  officer  of Lessee  adequate  and
                                    appropriate for the conduct of an automobile
                                    auction and  ancillary  business of at least
                                    the same  type,  quality  and  scale as that
                                    conducted   by  the  Lessee  on  the  Leased
                                    Property immediately prior to such Loss;

                           (ii)     the Available Proceeds, if any, with respect
                                    to such Loss, if any,  shall be disbursed by
                                    the Trustee as  provided  for in Section 6.3
                                    of the Indenture;

                           (iii)    the inadequacy of the Available  Proceeds to
                                    fund  the  cost  of  any  such   repairs  or
                                    restoration    shall   not    diminish   the
                                    obligation  of the  Lessee and ADESA to make
                                    such   repairs   or    restoration,    which
                                    obligation  is  unconditional  and absolute;
                                    and

                           (iv)     upon   completion   of  such   repairs   and
                                    restoration  and at  all  times  during  the
                                    conduct of such repairs and restoration, the
                                    Lessor  and its  representatives  may,  upon
                                    three (3)  business  days' notice to Lessee,
                                    inspect the Leased Property and the progress
                                    of the  restoration  and  rebuilding  of the
                                    Improvement and the Land. All reasonable and
                                    documented   out-of-pocket   costs  of  such
                                    inspections incurred by

                                    Lessor and the Lender will be paid by Lessee
                                    promptly  after  written  request.  No  such
                                    inspection shall unreasonably interfere with
                                    Lessee's operations or the operations of any
                                    other occupant of the Leased Property.  None
                                    of the  inspecting  parties  shall  have any
                                    duty to make any such  inspection or inquiry
                                    and  none of the  inspecting  parties  shall
                                    incur any  liability or obligation by reason
                                    of  not  making  any  such   inspection   or
                                    inquiry.  None  of  the  inspecting  parties
                                    shall incur any  liability or  obligation by
                                    reason  of  making  any such  inspection  or
                                    inquiry   unless  and  to  the  extent  such
                                    inspecting party causes damage to the Leased
                                    Property  or any  property  of Lessee or any

                                    in good faith that such Loss  constitutes  a

                                    Agreement;

                           (ii)     Any Available Proceeds disbursed as provided
                                    for Section  6.3(b)(iii) of the Indenture to
                                    the  holders  of   Outstanding   Notes  with

                                    interest  shall be  deemed to have been paid
                                    to the Lessor as Basic Rent; and

                           (iii)    Any Available Proceeds disbursed as provided

                                    (as  defined  in  the  Indenture)  shall  be
                                    deemed to have  been  paid to the  Lessor as
                                    Supplemental Rent.
                                              
         SECTION 11.5  Prosecution of Awards.

                  (a) With  respect  to any  condemnation  with  respect  to any
Leased  Property,  Lessee  shall  control  the  negotiations  with the  relevant
governmental  authority;  provided,  however,  that if an Event of Default shall
have  occurred  and be  continuing  Lessor or its  assigns  shall  control  such
negotiations.  Lessee  hereby  irrevocably  assigns,  transfers and sets over to
Lessor all rights of Lessee to any award made during the continuance of an Event
of Default on account of any  condemnation  and,  if there will not be  separate
awards to the Lessor and the Lessee on account of such condemnation, irrevocably
authorizes  and empowers  Lessor during the  continuance of an Event of Default,
with full power of  substitution in the name of Lessee or otherwise (but without
limiting the  obligations of Lessee under this  Article),  to file and prosecute
what would  otherwise  be Lessee's  claim for any such Award and, in the case of
Lessor,  to collect,  receipt for and retain the same in accordance with Section
6.3  of  the  Indenture;  provided,  however,  that  in  any  event  Lessor  may
participate  in any such  negotiations,  and no settlement  will be made without
Lessor's prior consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Lessee may prosecute,  and
Lessor shall have no interest  in, any claim with  respect to Lessee's  personal
property and equipment and Lessee's relocation expenses.
                       
         SECTION 11.6  Application of Certain  Payments Not Relating to an Event
of Complete  Taking.  In case of a  requisition  for  temporary  use of all or a
portion of the Leased  Property which is not an event of Complete  Taking,  this
Lease shall remain in full force and effect,  without any abatement or reduction
of Basic Rent or Additional  Rent, and the Awards for the Leased Property shall,
unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, be paid to Lessee.

         SECTION  11.7  Other   Dispositions.   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing
provisions of this  Article,  so long as an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be  continuing,  any amount  that would  otherwise  be payable to or for the
account of, or that would otherwise be retained by, Lessee

                                       13

pursuant to this Article shall be paid to Lessor as security for the obligations
of Lessee under this Lease and, at such time  thereafter  as no Event of Default
shall be continuing,  such amount shall be paid promptly to Lessee to the extent
not previously  applied by Lessor in accordance  with the terms of this Lease or
the other Operative Documents.
                                                                      
        SECTION  11.8  No Rent  Abatement.  Basic  Rent,  Additional  Rent  and
Supplement Rent shall not abate  hereunder by reason of any Loss  (regardless of
whether such Loss constitutes a Total Loss, a Partial Loss or a Complete Taking)
with respect to the Leased  Property,  and Lessee shall  continue to perform and
fulfill  all  of  Lessee's  obligations,   covenants  and  agreements  hereunder
notwithstanding such Loss until the end of the Lease Term.

         SECTION 11.9  Purchase Option and Remarketing Option.

                                    provided  for   therein,   except  that  for

                                   ENFORCEMENT

         SECTION 14.1  Remedies.  Upon the  occurrence  of any Event of Default,
Lessor  may, so long as such Event of Default is  continuing,  do one or more of
the following as Lessor in its sole discretion shall determine, without limiting
any other right or remedy Lessor may have on account of such Event of Default.

                  (a) Lessor may, by notice to Lessee, rescind or terminate this
Lease as of the date specified in such notice;  provided,  however,  that (i) no
reletting, reentry or taking of possession of the Leased Property by Lessor will
be  construed as an election on Lessor's  part to terminate  this Lease unless a
written notice of such intention is given to Lessee,  (ii)  notwithstanding  any
reletting,  reentry or taking of possession,  Lessor may at any time  thereafter
elect to terminate this Lease for a continuing Event of Default and (iii) no act
or thing done by Lessor or any of its agents,  representatives  or employees and
no agreement  accepting a surrender of the Leased Property shall be valid unless
the same be made in writing and executed by Lessor.

                  (b) Lessor may (i) demand that  Lessee,  and Lessee shall upon
the written demand of Lessor,  return the Leased Property  promptly to Lessor in
the manner and condition  required by, and  otherwise in accordance  with all of
the  provisions  of,  this  Lease  hereof as if the Leased  Property  were being
returned  at the end of the Lease Term,  and Lessor  shall not be liable for the
reimbursement  of  Lessee  for any  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by Lessee in
connection therewith and (ii) without prejudice to any other remedy which Lessor
may have for  possession  of the Leased  Property,  and to the extent and in the
manner  permitted by Applicable  law, enter upon the Leased  Property,  and take
immediate  possession of (to the exclusion of Lessee) the Leased Property or any
part  thereof  and  expel or  remove  Lessee  and any  other  Person  who may be
occupying the Leased Property, by summary proceedings or otherwise,  all without
liability  to Lessee  for or by reason  of such  entry or taking of  possession,
whether  for the  restoration  of damage to  property  caused by such  taking or
otherwise  and,  in  addition  to  Lessor's  other  damages,   Lessee  shall  be
responsible  for the reasonable and documented  costs and expenses of reletting,
including   brokers  fees  and  the  reasonable  and  documented  costs  of  any
alterations or repairs made by Lessor.

                  (c) Lessor may sell all or any part of the Leased  Property at
public or private sale, as Lessor may determine, free and clear of any rights of
Lessee and without any duty to account to Lessee with  respect to such action or
inaction or any proceeds with respect thereto in which event Lessee's obligation
to pay Basic Rent hereunder for periods  commencing  after the date of such sale
shall be terminated or proportionately reduced, as the case may be.

                  (d) Lessor  may,  at its option,  elect not to  terminate  the
Lease,  and continue to collect all Basic Rent,  Additional  Rent,  Supplemental
Rent and all other amounts due Lessor  (together  with all costs of  collection)
and enforce  Lessee's  obligations  under this Lease as and when the same become
due, or are to be performed, and at the option of Lessor, upon any abandonment

of the Leased  Property by Lessee or re-entry of same by Lessee,  Lessor may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, elect not to terminate this Lease and may make
such reasonable  alterations and necessary  repairs in order to relet the Leased
Property,  and relet the Leased  Property  or any part  thereof for such term or
terms (which may be for a long term extending beyond the term of this Lease) and
at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and  conditions as Lessor in
its  reasonable  discretion  may deem  advisable.  Upon each such  reletting all
rentals  actually  received  by Lessor from such  reletting  shall be applied to
Lessee's obligations hereunder in such order,  proportion and priority as Lessor
may elect in Lessor's sole and absolute  discretion,  it being agreed that under
no  circumstances  shall  Lessee  benefit  from its default from any increase in
market rents and if such rentals  received from such  reletting  during any Rent
Period  be less  than the Rent to be paid  during  that  Rent  Period  by Lessee
hereunder, Lessee shall pay any deficiency to Lessor on the Rent Payment Date in
such Rent Period.

                  (e) Lessor may  exercise any other right or remedy that may be
available to it under  applicable  law, or proceed by  appropriate  court action
(legal or equitable)  to enforce the terms hereof or to recover  damages for the
breach  hereof.  Separate  suits may be brought to collect any such damages with
respect  to any Rent  Payment  Date,  and such  suits  shall  not in any  manner
prejudice  Lessor's  right to collect any such damages for any  subsequent  Rent
Payment  Date,  or Lessor may defer any such suit until after the  expiration of
the Lease  Term,  in which  event such suit shall be deemed not to have  accrued
until the expiration of the Lease Term.

                  (f) Lessor may retain and apply against  Lessor's  damages all
sums which Lessor  would,  absent such Event of Default,  be required to pay, or
turn over, to Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Lease.

         SECTION 14.2 Remedies Cumulative;  No Waiver,  Consents.  To the extent
permitted by, and subject to the mandatory requirements of, applicable law, each
and  every  right  power  and  remedy  herein  specifically  given to  Lessor or
otherwise  in this Lease shall be  cumulative  and shall be in addition to every
other  right,  power and remedy  herein  specifically  given or now or hereafter
existing at law, in equity or by statute,  and each and every  right,  power and
remedy whether  specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised
from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed  expedient  by
Lessor, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy
shall not be  construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time
or thereafter any right,  power or remedy. No delay or omission by Lessor in the
exercise  of any right,  power or remedy or in the  pursuit of any remedy  shall
impair any such  right,  power or remedy or be  construed  to be a waiver of any
default on the part of Lessee or to be an acquiescence therein. Lessor's consent
to any request made by Lessee shall not be deemed to  constitute or preclude the
necessity  for  obtaining  Lessor's  consent,  in the  future,  to  all  similar
requests.  No express or implied  waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default shall
in any way be,  or be  construed  to be, a waiver of any  future  or  subsequent
Potential  Event of Default or Event of  Default.  To the  extent  permitted  by
applicable  law,  Lessee hereby waives any rights now or hereafter  conferred by
statute or otherwise that may require Lessor to sell, lease or otherwise use the
Leased Property or part thereof in

                                       18

mitigation  of Lessor's  damages upon the  occurrence  of an Event of Default or
that may otherwise limit or modify any of Lessor's rights or remedies under this
Article.

                           RIGHT TO PERFORM FOR LESSEE

         If Lessee  shall fail to perform or comply  with any of its  agreements
contained  herein,  Lessor may, on thirty (30) days prior notice (or such lesser
period  afforded by  Applicable  laws or any third party) to Lessee,  perform or
comply  with such  agreement,  and  Lessor  shall not  thereby be deemed to have
waived any default  caused by such  failure,  and the amount of such payment and
the amount of the expenses of Lessor (including  reasonable  attorney's fees and
expenses)  incurred in  connection  with such payment or the  performance  of or
compliance with such agreement, as the case may be, shall be deemed Supplemental
Rent,  payable by Lessee to Lessor  within ten (10) days  after  written  demand
therefor.

                                    additions  to tax result in whole or in part
                                    from the failure of a Tax Indemnitee to file
                                    a return that it

                                    is  required  to file in a proper and timely
                                    manner, unless such failure (A) results from
                                    the   transactions   contemplated   by   the
                                    Operative  Documents in circumstances  where
                                    the  Lessee  did not give  timely  notice to
                                    Lessor  (and  the  Lessor  otherwise  had no
                                    actual knowledge) of such filing requirement
                                    that  would  have  permitted  a  proper  and
                                    timely  filing of such return or (B) results
                                    from the  failure  of the  Lessee  to supply
                                    information  necessary  for the  proper  and
                                    timely filing of such return that was not in
                                    the possession of the Lessor.
                                                  
         SECTION  16.3  Procedures.  If any claim shall be made 
against any Tax Indemnitee or if any proceeding  shall be commenced  against any
Tax Indemnitee  (including a written notice of such proceeding) for any Taxes as
to which the Lessee may have an indemnity  obligation  pursuant to this Section,
or if any Tax Indemnitee  shall  determine that any Taxes as to which the Lessee
may have an indemnity  obligation pursuant to this Section may be payable,  such
Tax Indemnitee  shall promptly notify the Lessee.  The Lessee shall be entitled,
at its expense,  to participate in and to the extent that the Lessee desires to,
assume and control the defense thereof; provided, however, that the Lessee shall
have  acknowledged in writing if the contest is  unsuccessful  its obligation to
fully  indemnify  such  Tax  Indemnitee  in  respect  of  such  action,  suit or
proceeding;  and  provided,  further,  that the Lessee  shall not be entitled to
assume and control the defense of any such action,  suit or proceeding  (but the
Tax Indemnitee  shall then contest,  at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee,
on behalf of the Lessee) if and to the extent that (A) in the reasonable opinion
of such Tax Indemnitee,  such action, suit or proceeding involves any meaningful
risk of imposition of criminal  liability or any material risk of material civil
liability on such Tax  Indemnitee  or will involve a material  risk of the sale,
forfeiture or loss, or the creation,  of any Lien (other than a Permitted  Lien)
on the Leased Property or any part thereof unless the Lessee shall have posted a
bond or other security  satisfactory  to the relevant Tax Indemnities in respect
to such risk, (B) such proceeding  involves Claims not fully  indemnified by the
Lessee  which the Lessee and the Tax  Indemnitee  have been unable to sever from
the  indemnified  Claim(s),  (C)  an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and  is
continuing,  (D) such action,  suit or proceeding  involves matters which extend
beyond  or are  unrelated  to the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Operative
Documents and if determined  adversely  could be materially  detrimental  to the
interests of such Tax Indemnitee  notwithstanding  indemnification by the Lessee
or (E) such action,  suit or proceeding involves the federal or any state income
tax liability of the Tax Indemnitee.  With respect to any contests controlled by
a Tax Indemnitee, (i) if such contest relates to the federal or any state income
tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee,  such Tax Indemnitee  shall be required to
conduct  such  contest  only if the  Lessee  shall  have  provided  to such  Tax
Indemnitee an opinion of independent tax counsel  selected by the Tax Indemnitee
and reasonable satisfactory to the Lessee stating that a reasonable basis exists
to  contest  such  claim  or  (ii)  in  the  case  of an  appeal  of an  adverse
determination  of any contest  relating to any Taxes, an opinion of such counsel
to the  effect  that  such  appeal  is more  likely  than not to be  successful;
provided,  however,  such Tax Indemnitee shall in no event be required to appeal
an adverse  determination to the United States Supreme Court. The Tax Indemnitee
may  participate  in a  reasonable  manner at its own  expense  and with its own
counsel  in any  proceeding  conducted  by the  Lessee  in  accordance  with the
foregoing.  Each Tax Indemnitee  shall at the Lessee's expense supply the Lessee
with such information, documents and testimony reasonably

                                       22

<PAGE>

requested  by the  Lessee  as are  necessary  to  advisable  for the  Lessee  to
participate  in any action,  suit or proceeding to the extent  permitted by this
Section.  Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing,  no
Tax Indemnitee  shall enter into any settlement or other compromise with respect
to any Claim which is entitled to be indemnified  under this Section without the
prior written  consent of the Lessee,  which  consent shall not be  unreasonably
withheld,  unless such Tax Indemnitee  waives its right to be indemnified  under
this  Section  with respect to such Claim.  Notwithstanding  anything  contained
herein to the  contrary,  (i) a Tax  Indemnitee  will not be required to contest
(and the Lessee  shall not be  permitted to contest) a claim with respect to the
imposition  of  any  Tax if  such  Tax  Indemnitee  shall  waive  its  right  to
indemnification  under this  Section with respect to such claim (and any related
claim with respect to other taxable years the contest of which is precluded as a
result of such waiver) and (ii) no Tax  Indemnitee  shall be required to contest
any claim if the subject  matter  thereof  shall be of a  continuing  nature and
shall have previously been decided adversely,  unless there has been a change in
law which in the opinion of the Lessee's counsel creates  substantial  authority
for the  success of such  contest.  Each Tax  Indemnitee  and the  Lessee  shall
consult  in good faith with each other  regarding  the  conduct of such  contest
controlled by either.

         SECTION 16.4  Credits and Refunds. If (i) a Tax Indemnitee shall 
obtain a credit  or  refund of any Taxes  paid by the  Lessee  pursuant  to this
Section or (ii) by reason of the incurrence or imposition of any Tax for which a
Tax  Indemnitee  is  indemnified  hereunder  or any  payment  made to or for the
account of such Tax Indemnitee by the Lessee pursuant to this Section,  such Tax
Indemnitee at any time realizes a reduction in any Taxes for which the Lessee is
not required to indemnify  such Tax Indemnitee  pursuant to this Section,  which
reduction in Taxes was not taken into  account in computing  such payment by the
Lessee to or for the account of such Tax  Indemnitee,  then such Tax  Indemnitee
shall  promptly pay to the Lessee the amount of such credit or refund,  together
with the amount of any interest  received by such Tax  Indemnitee  on account of
such credit or refund or an amount equal to such reduction in Taxes, as the case
may be;  provided,  however,  that no such  payment  shall be made so long as an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;  and provided,  further,
that the amount  payable to the Lessee by any Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant  to this
subsection  shall not at any time exceed the  aggregate  amount of all indemnity
payments  made by the Lessee under this Section to such Tax  Indemnitee  and all
related Tax Indemnities with respect to the Taxes which gave rise to a credit or
refund or with  respect to the Tax which gave rise to a reduction  in Taxes less
the amount of all prior  payments made to the Lessee by such Tax  Indemnitee and
related Tax Indemnities under this Section. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to act in
good faith to claim such refunds and other available Tax benefits, and take such
other  actions as may be  reasonable to minimize any payment due from the Lessee
pursuant to this Section and to maximize the amount of any Tax savings available
to it. The disallowance or reduction of any credit,  refund or other tax savings
with  respect to which a Tax  Indemnitee  has made a payment to the Lessee under
this  subsection  shall be treated as a Tax for which the Lessee is obligated to
indemnify such Tax Indemnitee hereunder.

         SECTION 16.5  Payments. Any Tax indemnifiable under this Section shall
be paid directly when due to the applicable  taxing  authority of direct payment
is  practicable  and  permitted.  If direct  payment  to the  applicable  taxing
authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made, any

                                       23

<PAGE>

amount payable to a Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this Section shall be paid within
thirty  (30) days  after  receipt  of a written  demand  therefor  from such Tax
Indemnitee  accompanied by a written  statement  describing in reasonable detail
the amount so payable,  but not before the date that the relevant Taxes are due.
Any payments  made  pursuant to this Section  shall be made  directly to the Tax
Indemnitee  entitled  thereto or the Lessor,  as the case may be, in immediately
available  funds at such bank or to such  account as  specified  by the payee in
written directions to the payor, or, if no such direction shall have been given,
by check of the  payor  payable  to the order of the  payee by  certified  mail,
postage prepaid at its address as set forth in this Agreement.  Upon the request
of any Tax Indemnitee  with respect to a Tax that the Lessee is required to pay,
the Lessee shall furnish to such Tax Indemnitee the original or a certified copy
of a receipt for Lessee's  payment of such Tax or such other evidence of payment
as is reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee.

         SECTION 16.6  Reports, Returns and Statements. If the Lessee knows of 
any report,  return or statement  required to be filed with respect to any Taxes
that are subject to indemnification under this Section, the Lessee shall, if the
Lessee is  permitted  by  Applicable  law,  timely file such  report,  return or
statement  (and, to the extent  permitted by law,  show  ownership of the Leased
Property in the Lessee); provided,  however, that if the Lessee is not permitted
by Applicable  law or does not have access to the  information  required to file
any such  report,  return or  statement  the Lessee will  promptly so notify the
appropriate Tax Indemnitee,  in which case Tax Indemnitee will file such report.
In any case in which the Tax  Indemnitee  will file any such  report,  return or
statement,  Lessee shall,  upon written request of such Tax Indemnitee,  provide
such Tax  Indemnitee  with such  information  as is reasonably  available to the
Lessee.
       
                                  ARTICLE XVII
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 17.1  Reports. To the extent required under applicable law and
to the  extent it is  reasonably  practical  for Lessee to do so,  Lessee  shall
prepare and file in timely fashion, or, where such filing is required to be made
by Lessor or it is otherwise  not  reasonably  practical for Lessee to make such
filing,  Lessee shall  prepare and deliver to Lessor (with a copy to the Lender)
within a reasonable time prior to the date for filing and Lessor shall file, any
material  reports  with  respect to the  condition  or  operation  of the Leased
Property that shall be required to be filed with any governmental authority.

         SECTION 17.2  Binding  Effect; Successors and Assigns; Survival. The 
terms and provisions of this Lease,  and the respective  rights and  obligations
hereunder  of  Lessor  and  Lessee,  shall  be  binding  upon  their  respective
successors, legal representatives and assigns (including, in the case of Lessor,
any Person to whom  Lessor may  transfer  the Leased  Property  or any  interest
therein in accordance with the provisions of the Operative Documents), and inure
to the benefit of their respective  permitted successors and assigns, and rights
hereunder  of the  Trustee  shall  inure  (subject  to  such  conditions  as are
contained  herein) to the  benefit of the  Trustee's  permitted  successors  and
assigns.

                                       24

<PAGE>

         SECTION 17.3  Quiet Enjoyment.  Lessor  covenants that,  so long as no
Event of Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  it will not  interfere  in
Lessee's or any of its  sublessees'  quiet  enjoyment of the Leased  Property in
accordance  with this Lease during the Lease Term. Such right of quiet enjoyment
is independent of, and shall not affect,  Lessor's rights  otherwise to initiate
legal action to enforce the obligations of Lessee under this Lease.

         SECTION 17.4  Notices.  Unless otherwise specified herein, all notices,
offers,   acceptances,   rejections,   consents,   requests,  demands  or  other
communications  to or upon the  respective  parties hereto shall be given in the
manner provided for in the Note Purchase Agreement.

         SECTION 17.5  Severability.  Any  provision of this Lease that shall be
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof  and any  such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction,  and Lessee shall remain
liable  to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  except  to the  extent of such
unenforceability.  To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  Lessee  hereby
waives any  provision of law that renders any  provision  hereof  prohibited  or
unenforceable in any respect.

         SECTION 17.6  Amendment; Complete Agreements. Neither  this  Lease nor 
any of the terms  hereof may be  terminated,  amended,  supplemented,  waived or
modified orally,  except by an instrument in writing signed by Lessor and Lessee
and approved by ADESA and by the Trustee as provided for in the Indenture.  This
Lease,  together with the other Operative Documents,  is intended by the parties
as final  expression  of their lease  agreement  and as a complete and exclusive
statement  of  the  terms  thereof,   all   negotiations,   considerations   and
representations between the parties having been incorporated herein and therein.
No course of prior dealings  between the parties or their  officers,  employees,
agents or Affiliates shall be relevant or admissible to supplement,  explain, or
vary any of the terms of this Lease or any other Operative Document.  Acceptance
of, or acquiescence in, a course of performance rendered under this or any prior
agreement  between  the  parties or their  Affiliates  shall not be  relevant or
admissible  to  determine  the  meaning of any of the terms of this Lease or any
other Operative Document. No representations,  undertakings,  or agreements have
been  made or  relied  upon  in the  making  of  this  Lease  other  than  those
specifically set forth in the Operative Documents.

         SECTION  17.7  Construction.  This Lease  shall not be  construed  more
strictly  against any one party,  it being  recognized  that both of the Parties
hereto have  contributed  substantially  and materially to the  preparation  and
negotiation of this Lease.

         SECTION  17.8  Headings.  The Table of  Contents  and  headings  of the
various  Articles  and Sections of this Lease are for  convenience  of reference
only and shall  not  modify,  define  or limit  any of the  terms or  provisions
hereof.

                                       25

<PAGE>

         SECTION  17.9  Counterparts.  This Lease may be executed by the parties
hereto in separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed and  delivered
shall be an original,  but all such counterparts  shall together  constitute but
one and the same instrument.

         SECTION  17.10  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS LEASE  SHALL IN ALL  RESPECTS  BE
GOVERNED  BY, AND  CONSTRUED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NORTH
CAROLINA  APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH
STATE,  INCLUDING  ALL  MATTERS  OF  CONSTRUCTION,  VALIDITY,  PERFORMANCE,  THE
CREATION  OF THE  LEASEHOLD  ESTATE  HEREUNDER  AND THE  EXERCISE  OF RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ESTATE.

         SECTION  17.11  Discharge of Lessee's  Obligations  by its  Affiliates.
Lessor agrees that performance of any of Lessee's  obligations  hereunder by one
or more of  Lessee's  Affiliates  or one or more of  Lessee's  subleases  of the
Leased  Property or any part thereof shall  constitute  performance by Lessee of
such  obligations  to the same extent and with the same effect  hereunder  as if
such obligations were performed by Lessee,  but no such performance shall excuse
Lessee  from any  obligation  not  performed  by it or on its  behalf  under the
Operative Documents.

         SECTION  17.12  Liability  of  Lessor  Limited.   Except  as  otherwise
expressly provided below in this Section, it is expressly  understood and agreed
by and between Lessee,  Lessor and their respective  successors and assigns that
nothing herein  contained shall be construed as creating any liability of Lessor
or any of  its  Affiliates  or any  of  their  respective  officers,  directors,
employees or agents, individually or personally, to perform any covenant, either
express  or  implied,  contained  herein,  all  such  liability,  if any,  being
expressly  waived  by  Lessee  and by each and  every  Person  now or  hereafter
claiming by,  through or under  Lessee and that,  so far as Lessor or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,  employees or agents,
individually  or personally,  is concerned,  Lessee and any Person  claiming by,
through or under  Lessee  shall look solely to the right,  title and interest of
Lessor in the Leased Property and any proceeds from Lessor's sale or encumbrance
thereof or the  Additional  Rent  (provided,  however,  that Lessee shall not be
entitled to any double  recovery) for the  performance of any  obligation  under
this  Lease  and under  the  Operative  Documents  and the  satisfaction  of any
liability arising therefrom.

         SECTION 17.13  Estoppel Certificates.  Each party hereto agrees that at
any time and from time to time during the Lease Term, it will  promptly,  but in
no event later than thirty  (30) days after  request by the other party  hereto,
execute,  acknowledge  and  deliver to such other  party or to the  Lender,  any
prospective  purchaser (if such prospective purchaser has signed a commitment or
letter of intent to purchase the Leased Property or any part thereof),  assignee
or  mortgagee  or third party  designated  by such other  party,  a  certificate
stating (i) that this Lease is  unmodified  and in force and effect (or if there
have been modifications, that this lease is in force and effect as modified, and
identifying the modification agreements),  (ii) the date to which Basic Rent and
Additional  Rent has been  paid,  (iii)  whether  or not  there is any  existing
default by Lessee in the payment of Basic Rent and Additional  Rent or any other
sum of money hereunder, and whether or not there is any other

                                       26

<PAGE>

existing  default by either  party with respect to which a notice of default has
been served and, if there is any such default,  specifying the nature and extent
thereof,  (iv) whether or not, to the  knowledge of the signer after due inquiry
and  investigation,  there are any setoffs,  defenses or  counterclaims  against
enforcement of the  obligations to be performed  hereunder  existing in favor of
the party executing such  certificate and (v) other items that may be reasonably
requested;  provided,  however, that no such certificate may be requested unless
the requesting party has a good faith reason for such request.

         SECTION 17.14  No Joint Venture. Any intention to create a joint
venture or partnership  relation  between Lessor and Lessee is hereby  expressly
disclaimed.

         SECTION 17.15  No Accord and  Satisfaction. The acceptance by Lessor of
any sums from Lessee  (whether as Basic Rent or  otherwise) in amounts which are
less than the amounts due and payable by Lessee  hereunder is not intended,  nor
shall any such acceptance be construed, to constitute an accord and satisfaction
of any  dispute  between  Lessor and Lessee  regarding  sums due and  payable by
Lessee hereunder, unless Lessor specifically deems it as such in writing.

         SECTION  17.16  No Merger.  In no event shall the leasehold interests,
estates  or rights of Lessee  hereunder  merge  with any  interests,  estates or
rights of Lessor in or to the Leased  Property,  it being  understood  that such
leasehold  interests,  estates and rights of Lessee hereunder shall be deemed to
be separate and distinct  from Lessor's  interests,  estates and rights in or to
the Leased Property,  notwithstanding that any such interests, estates or rights
shall at any time or times be held by or vested in the same person,  corporation
or other entity.

         SECTION 17.17  Survival. The obligations of Lessee to be performed
under  this  Lease  prior  to the  Lease  Termination  Date  shall  survive  the
expiration or termination of this Lease. The extension of any applicable statute
of  limitations  by  Lessor,  Lessee or any  Indemnitee  shall not  affect  such
survival.

         SECTION 17.18  Prior Mortgages.  This Lease is and shall be subject and
subordinate  to that certain Deed of Trust and Security  Agreement,  dated as of
November 22, 1994, by Lessor in favor of The Fidelity  Company,  as trustee (the
"Local  Trustee"),  for the benefit of the Trustee  and  encumbering  the Leased
Property, and to all rights of the Local Trustee and the Trustee thereunder, and
to  all  renewals,   modifications,   consolidations,   amendments,   increases,
replacements and extensions thereof ("Mortgage").

         Lessee  agrees to  perform  all of the  obligations  of Lessor  (in its
capacity  as grantor)  set forth in the  Mortgage,  insofar as such  obligations
relate,  directly or  indirectly,  to the Leased  Property,  whether or not such
obligations  are more onerous than the  obligations  imposed upon Lessee by this
Lease.

                                       27

<PAGE>

         Whenever any provision of this Lease requires any consent,  approval or
agreement  of the  Lessor,  such  requirement  shall be  deemed to  include  the
consent, approval or agreement of the Trustee, so long as the Mortgage shall not
have been discharged.

         SECTION 17.19  Time of Essence. Time is of the essence of this Lease.

         SECTION 17.20  Recordation of Lease. Lessee will, at its expense, cause
a Memorandum of this Lease and the Purchase  Option to be recorded in the proper
office or offices in the State of North Carolina and the  municipality  in which
the Land is located.

Lessor,  the  Trustee or any party to any  agreements  related  thereto  for any
reason  whatsoever.  Lessee assumes the sole  responsibility  for the condition,
use,  operation,  maintenance,  and management of the Leased Property and Lessor
shall have no  responsibility in respect thereof and shall have no liability for
damage to the  property  of  either  Lessee  or any  subtenant  of Lessee on any
account or for any reason  whatsoever  other than by reason of Lessor's  willful

any Operative Document.

                                    ARTICLE V
                      CONDITION AND USE OF LEASED PROPERTY

         During the Lease Term, Lessor's interest in the Improvement (whether or
not  completed) and the Land is demised and let by Lessor "AS IS" subject to (i)
the rights of any  parties in  possession  thereof,  (ii) the state of the title
thereto  existing  at the  time  Lessor  acquired  its  interest  in the  Leased
Property,  (iii)  any  state  of facts  which an  accurate  survey  or  physical
inspection might show (including the survey delivered on the Closing Date), (iv)
all applicable law and (v) any violations of applicable law which may exist upon
or subsequent to the commencement of the Lease Term. LESSEE  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT,
ALTHOUGH LESSOR WILL OWN AND HOLD TITLE TO THE LEASED PROPERTY, LESSEE IS SOLELY
RESPONSIBLE  FOR THE DESIGN,  DEVELOPMENT,  BUDGETING  AND  CONSTRUCTION  OF THE
IMPROVEMENT [IMPROVEMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS] AND ANY ALTERATIONS. NEITHER LESSOR
NOR THE TRUSTEE HAVE MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY  REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO

HAVE  ANY  LIABILITY  WHATSOEVER  AS  TO  THE  VALUE,  MERCHANTABILITY,   TITLE,
HABITABILITY  CONDITION,  DESIGN,  OPERATION,  OR FITNESS  FOR USE OF THE LEASED
PROPERTY  (OR  ANY  PART  THEREOF),  OR ANY  OTHER  REPRESENTATION  OR  WARRANTY
WHATSOEVER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  WITH RESPECT TO THE LEASED PROPERTY (OR ANY PART
THEREOF),  ALL SUCH WARRANTIES BEING HEREBY  DISCLAIMED,  AND NEITHER LESSOR NOR
THE LENDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LATENT,  HIDDEN,  OR PATENT DEFECT THEREIN OR
THE  FAILURE OF THE LEASED  PROPERTY,  OR ANY PART  THEREOF,  TO COMPLY WITH ANY
APPLICABLE  LAW. As between  Lessor and Lessee,  Lessee has been  afforded  full
opportunity  to  inspect  the  Land,  is  satisfied  with  the  results  of  its
inspections  of the Land and is entering  into this Lease solely on the basis of
the  results  of its own  inspections  and all  risks  incident  to the  matters
discussed in the two preceding  sentences,  as between Lessor or the Trustee, on
the one  hand,  and  Lessee,  on the  other,  are to be  borne  by  Lessee.  The
provisions  of this  Article  have been  negotiated  and,  except to the  extent
otherwise  expressly  stated,  the  foregoing  provisions  are  intended to be a
complete  exclusion and negation of any  representations or warranties by Lessor
or the Trustee, express or implied, with respect to the Leased Property that may
arise pursuant to any law now or hereafter in effect or otherwise.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                      LIENS; EASEMENTS; PARTIAL CONVEYANCES

         Commencing on the date that  Construction  is completed and thereafter,
Lessee  shall not  directly or  indirectly  create,  incur or assume,  any lien,
encumbrance or security interest on or with respect to the Leased Property,  the
Construction,  title thereto,  or any interest  therein  ("Lien")  including any
Liens which arise out of the possession, use, occupancy, construction, repair or
rebuilding of the Leased  Property or by reason of labor or materials  furnished
or claimed to have been furnished to Lessee, or any of its contractors or agents
or by reason of the financing of any personalty or equipment purchased or leased
by Lessee or Alterations  constructed by Lessee,  except in all cases  Permitted
Exceptions.

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  paragraph,  at the  request of Lessee,
Lessor  shall,  from  time to time  during  the Lease  Term and upon  reasonable
advance written notice from Lessee and receipt of the materials specified in the
next  succeeding  sentence,  consent to and join in any (i) grant of  easements,
licenses, rights of way and other rights in the nature of easements,  including,
without limitation,  utility easements to facilitate  Lessee's use,  development
and  construction  of the  Leased  Property,  (ii)  release  or  termination  of
easements,  licenses,  rights of way or other  rights in the nature of easements
which are for the benefit of the Land or the Improvement or any portion thereof,
(iii)  dedication  or  transfer of portions  of the Land,  not  improved  with a
building,  for  road,  highway  or other  public  purposes,  (iv)  execution  of
agreements   for  ingress  and  egress  and  amendments  to  any  covenants  and
restrictions  affecting the Land or the  Improvement or any portion  thereof and
(v)  request to any  governmental  authority  for  platting  or  subdivision  or
replotting  or  resubdivision  approval  with respect to the Land or any portion
thereof or any parcel of land of which the Land or any portion  thereof  forms a
part or a request for any variance from zoning or other governmental

                                       8

requirements.  Lessor's  obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
subject to the requirements that:

                        (i)    any such  action  shall  be at the sole  cost and
                               expense  of  Lessee  and  Lessee  shall  pay  all
                               reasonable and documented  out-of-pocket costs of
                               Lessor  in   connection   therewith   (including,
                               without limitation, the reasonable and documented
                               fees   of   attorneys,   architects,   engineers,
                               planners,   appraisers  and  other  professionals
                               reasonably  retained by Lessor in connection with
                               any such action);

                       (ii)    Lessee   shall   have   delivered   to  Lessor  a
                               certificate  of the Chief  Financial  Officer  of
                               Lessee  stating  that  (1) such  action  will not
                               cause the Land or the  Improvement or any portion
                               thereof to fail to comply in any respect with the
                               provisions  of the Lease or any  other  Operative
                               Documents or in any respect with  applicable  law
                               and (2) such  action will not  materially  reduce
                               the fair market  sales  value,  utility or useful
                               life of the Land or the  Improvement nor Lessor's
                               interest therein;

                       (iii)   any consideration received in connection with any
                               such action  shall be paid as provided for in the
                               Indenture; and

                       (iv)    in the  case of any  release  or  conveyance,  if
                               Lessor  so  requests,  Lessee  will  cause  to be
                               issued  and  delivered  to  Lessor  by the  Title
                               Insurance  Company  an  endorsement  to the Title
                               Policy  pursuant  to which  the  Title  Insurance
                               Company agrees that its liability for the payment
                               of  any  loss  or  damage  under  the  terms  and
                               provisions  of  the  Title  Policy  will  not  be
                               affected  by reason of the fact that a portion of
                               the real  property  referred  to in Schedule A of
                               the Title Policy has been released or conveyed by
                               Lessor.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                             MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR;
                    ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS

         SECTION 7.1 Maintenance and Repair; Compliance with Law. Lessee, at its
own expense,  shall at all times (i) maintain the Leased Property in good repair
and condition  (subject to ordinary wear and tear),  in accordance  with prudent
industry  standards  and,  in any  event,  in no less a manner as other  similar
automobile auction facilities owned or leased by ADESA,  Lessee or ADESA's other
subsidiaries,  (ii)  make all  alterations  in  accordance  with,  and  maintain
(whether  or  not  such  maintenance   requires   structural   modifications  or
alterations)  and operate and otherwise  keep the Leased  Property in compliance
with, all applicable laws and (iii) make all material repairs,  replacements and
renewals  of the Leased  Property or any part  thereof  which may be required to
keep the Leased Property in the condition  required by the preceding clauses (i)
and (ii). Lessee shall

                                       9

<PAGE>

perform the foregoing maintenance  obligations  regardless of whether the Leased
Property is occupied or unoccupied. Lessee waives any right that it may now have
or hereafter acquire to (i) require Lessor to maintain,  repair, replace, alter,
remove or rebuild all or any part of the Leased Property or (ii) make repairs at
the expense of Lessor  pursuant to any  applicable  law or other  agreements  or
otherwise.  Lessor  shall  not  be  liable  to  Lessee  or to  any  contractors,
subcontractors,   laborers,  materialmen,  suppliers  or  vendors  for  services
performed or material  provided on or in connection  with the Leased Property or
any part  thereof.  Lessor  shall not be required to  maintain,  alter,  repair,
rebuild or replace the Leased Property in any way.

         SECTION 7.2 Alterations.  Lessee may, without the consent of Lessor, at
Lessee's own cost and expense, make alterations which, in the reasonable opinion
of the chief  executive  officer of  Lessee,  do not  diminish  the value of the
Leased Property.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                       USE

         Lessee  shall use the Leased  Property or any part thereof only for the
purpose of used automobile  auction  business capable of operating not less than
the  number  of  simultaneous   auction  lines  anticipated  in  the  Plans  and
Specifications, together with related or ancillary businesses including, without
limitation, automobile storage, repair and preparation,  transportation,  direct
sales or other businesses related to used automobile auctions.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                    INSURANCE

                  (a) During the  Construction  and at any time during which any
part of the  Improvement or any Alteration is under  construction  and as to any
part of the  Improvement  or any  Alteration  under  construction,  Lessee shall
maintain,  at its sole cost and  expense,  as a part of its blanket  policies or
otherwise,  "all risks"  nonreporting  completed  value form of  builder's  risk
insurance,  which  insurance and policies shall, in each case, be in the amounts
and otherwise be consistent  with any applicable  requirements  set forth in the
Note Purchase Agreement, Indenture or Mortgage.

                  (b) Following the  Completion of the  Construction  and at all
times thereafter during the Lease Term, Lessee shall maintain,  at its sole cost
and expense,  as a part of its blanket policies or otherwise,  insurance against
loss  or  damage  to  the  Improvement  by  fire  and  other  risks,   including
comprehensive  boiler and  machinery  coverage,  on terms and in amounts no less
favorable than insurance  covering other similar  properties owned by the Lessee
and that are in accordance with normal industry  practice,  but in no event less
than the  coverage in place on the date  hereof,  which  insurance  and policies
shall,  in each case,  be in the amounts and  otherwise be  consistent  with any
applicable  requirements set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement,  Indenture or
Mortgage.

<PAGE>

                  (c) During the Lease Term, Lessee shall maintain,  at its sole
cost and expense,  commercial  general  liability  insurance,  as is  ordinarily
procured by Persons who own or operate  similar  properties  in the same market,
which  insurance  and  policies  shall,  in each  case,  be in the  amounts  and
otherwise be consistent with any applicable  requirements  set forth in the Note
Purchase Agreement,  Indenture or Mortgage. Such insurance shall be on terms and
in amounts that are no less favorable  than insurance  maintained by Lessee with
respect  to  similar  properties  that it owns and that are in  accordance  with
normal  industry  practice,  but in no event less than the  coverage  (including
types and amounts) in place on the date hereof.  Such  insurance  policies shall
also provide that  Lessee's  insurance  shall be considered  primary  insurance.
Nothing in this Article shall  prohibit  Lessor from carrying at its own expense
other insurance on or with respect to the Leased  Property;  provided,  however,
that any insurance  carried by Lessor shall not prevent Lessee from carrying the
insurance required hereby.

                  (d) Each policy of insurance  maintained by Lessee pursuant to
clauses (a) and (b) of this Article shall provide that all Casualty Proceeds (as
defined and provided for in the  Indenture)  shall be payable to the Trustee for
deposit and disbursement as provided for in Section 6.3 of the Indenture.

                  (e) Within  thirty  (30) days after the date hereof and within
thirty (30) days after the date upon which the Construction is completed, Lessee
shall  furnish  Lessor and the Trustee with  certificates  showing the insurance
required under this Article to be in effect and naming Lessor and the Trustee as
additional insureds. Such certificates shall include a provision for thirty (30)
days'  advance  written  notice by the  insurer to Lessor and the Trustee in the
event of  cancellation  or  expiration  or nonpayment of premium with respect to
such insurance, and shall include a customary breach of warranty clause.

                  (f) Each policy of insurance  maintained by Lessee pursuant to
this  Article  shall (i) contain the waiver of any right of  subrogation  of the
insurer  against  Lessor and the Trustee and (ii) provide that in respect of the
interested of Lessor and the Trustee,  such policies shall not be invalidated by
any fraud or misrepresentation of Lessee or any other Person acting on behalf of
Lessee.

                  (g) On and after  January  1,  1996,  all  insurance  policies
carried in accordance  with this Article shall be maintained with insurers rated
at the inception of such  policies at least "A" by A.M.  Best & Company,  and in
all  cases  the  insurer  shall be  qualified  to  insure  risks in the State of
Massachusetts.

                            ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASING

         Lessee may not assign any of its  right,  title or  interest  in, to or
under this Lease. Lessee may sublease all or any portion of the Leased Property;
provided,  however,  that (i) all  obligations  of Lessee shall continue in full
effect as obligations of a principal and not of a guarantor or surety, as

                                       11

<PAGE>

though no sublease had been made, (ii) such sublease shall be expressly  subject
and  subordinate  to this  Lease,  the  Indenture,  the  Mortgage  and the other
Operative  Documents and (iii) each such sublease  shall  terminate on or before
the last day of the Lease Term.  Except as provided for in the  Indenture,  this
Lease shall not be mortgaged or pledged by Lessee,  nor shall Lessee mortgage or
pledge any  interest in the Leased  Property or any  portion  thereof.  Any such
mortgage or pledge shall be void.

                    LOSS, DESTRUCTION, CONDEMNATION OR DAMAGE

         SECTION 11.1 Available Proceeds. All Casualty Proceeds and Condemnation
Awards (both as defined in the Indenture,  and which are collectively defined in
the Indenture as "Available Proceeds") shall be remitted and paid to the Trustee
by the Lessee,  the Lessor or ADESA, as applicable,  for deposit in the Casualty
Account (as defined and established under the Indenture) for  disbursement,  all
as provided for in Section 6.3 of the Indenture.  Until such time as the Lessee,
the Lessor,  ADESA or any of their  respective  agents or  representatives  have
remitted and paid any Available Proceeds to the Trustee,  such Person shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the benefit of the Trustee.  In the event that at any
time during the Lease Term, the Indenture has been terminated, the Lessor shall,
for purposes of this Article,  be treated as the Trustee,  and shall deposit and
disburse any  Available  Proceeds in  substantially  the manner  provided for in
Section 6.3 of the Indenture as if it were the Trustee.

         SECTION 11.2 Repairs and Restoration. In the event of any Total Loss or
Partial Loss (collectively,  "Loss"), other than a Total Loss which, in the good
faith judgment of the chief  executive  officer of Lessee renders the repair and
restoration  of the  Leased  Property  impractical  or  uneconomical  including,
without  limitation,  any  condemnation of the Leased Property  resulting in the
taking of all or  substantially  all of the  Leased  Property  (collectively,  a
"Complete Taking"), then:

                        (i)    the Lessee and ADESA shall repair and restore the
                               Leased  Property such that the Leased Property as
                               so repaired  and  restored  is, in the good faith
                               judgment of the chief executive officer of Lessee
                               adequate  and  appropriate  for the conduct of an
                               automobile  auction and ancillary  business of at
                               least the same  type,  quality  and scale as that
                               conducted  by the Lessee on the  Leased  Property
                               immediately prior to such Loss;

                       (ii)    the Available  Proceeds,  if any, with respect to
                               such  Loss,  if any,  shall be  disbursed  by the
                               Trustee as  provided  for in  Section  6.3 of the
                               Indenture;

                       (iii)   the inadequacy of the Available  Proceeds to fund
                               the cost of any such repairs or restoration shall
                               not  diminish  the  obligation  of the Lessee and
                               ADESA to make such repairs or restoration,  which
                               obligation is unconditional and absolute; and

                       (iv)    upon  completion of such repairs and  restoration
                               and at all  times  during  the  conduct  of  such
                               repairs  and  restoration,  the  Lessor  and  its
                               representatives  may,  upon  three  (3)  business
                               days'  notice  to  Lessee,   inspect  the  Leased
                               Property and the progress of the  restoration and
                               rebuilding of the  Improvement  and the Land. All
                               reasonable and documented  out-of-pocket costs of
                               such  inspections  incurred  by  Lessor  and  the
                               Lender  will  be paid by  Lessee  promptly  after
                               written   request.   No  such  inspection   shall
                               unreasonably  interfere with Lessee's  operations
                               or the  operations  of any other  occupant of the
                               Leased Property.  None of the inspecting  parties
                               shall  have any duty to make any such  inspection
                               or  inquiry  and none of the  inspecting  parties
                               shall incur any liability or obligation by reason
                               of not making  any such  inspection  or  inquiry.
                               None of the  inspecting  parties  shall incur any
                               liability or  obligation  by reason of making any
                               such  inspection  or  inquiry  unless  and to the
                               extent such inspecting party causes damage to the
                               Leased  Property or any property of Lessee or any
                               other   Person   during   the   course   of  such
                               inspection.

         SECTION 11.3  Complete Taking. In the event of any Complete Taking 
with respect to the Leased Property:

                        (i)    the  Lessee   shall   provide  to  the  Lessor  a
                               certification  stating  that the chief  executive
                               officer  of Lessee has  determined  in good faith
                               that such Loss constitutes a Complete Taking with
                               respect to the Leased Property as defined in this
                               Lease;

                       (ii)    the Lessee and ADESA  shall not be  obligated  or
                               required to make any repairs to or restoration of
                               the Leased Property, other than those repairs, if
                               any,  required by applicable  law or necessary to
                               adequately  secure the Leased  Property or comply
                               with the requirements of any applicable insurance
                               policy  or  any  applicable  safety,   health  or
                               environmental regulations;

                       (iii)   any Available  Proceeds with respect to such Loss
                               shall be  disbursed  as  provided  for in section
                               6.3(b)(iii) of the Indenture; and

                       (iv)    except as otherwise  provided for in Section 11.9
                               hereof, this Lease shall remain in full force and
                               effect.

         SECTION 11.4  Application  of Available  Proceeds.  In the event of any
Partial  Loss or Total Loss  (whether  or not such Loss  constitutes  a Complete
Taking), Available Proceeds, if any,

                                       13

with  respect to such Loss shall be  disbursed  only as provided  for in Section
6.3(b) of the Indenture; and:

                        (i)    Any Available  Proceeds disbursed as provided for
                               in Section  6.3(b)(iii)  of the  Indenture to the

                               prepayment  of the  principal  amount  thereof or
                               disbursed  to  the  Lessor  as  provided  for  in
                               Section  6.3(b) of the Indenture  shall be deemed
                               to be  and  shall  be  treated  as  Casualty  and
                               Condemnation  Credits for  purposes of this Lease
                               and the Guaranty Agreement;

                       (ii)    Any Available  Proceeds disbursed as provided for
                               Section  6.3(b)(iii)  of  the  Indenture  to  the
                               holders of Outstanding  Notes with respect to the
                               payment of accrued but unpaid  interest  shall be
                               deemed to have  been paid to the  Lessor as Basic

                       (iii)   Any Available  Proceeds disbursed as provided for

                  (a) With  respect  to any  condemnation  with  respect  to any
Leased  Property,  Lessee  shall  control  the  negotiations  with the  relevant
governmental  authority;  provided,  however,  that if an Event of Default shall

negotiations.  Lessee  hereby  irrevocably  assigns,  transfers and sets over to
Lessor all rights of Lessee to any award made during the continuance of an Event
of Default on account of any  condemnation  and,  if there will not be  separate
awards to the Lessor and the Lessee on account of such condemnation, irrevocably
authorizes  and empowers  Lessor during the  continuance of an Event of Default,
with full power of  substitution in the name of Lessee or otherwise (but without
limiting the  obligations of Lessee under this  Article),  to file and prosecute
what would  otherwise  be Lessee's  claim for any such Award and, in the case of
Lessor,  to collect,  receipt for and retain the same in accordance with Section
6.3  of  the  Indenture;  provided,  however,  that  in  any  event  Lessor  may
participate  in any such  negotiations,  and no settlement  will be made without
Lessor's prior consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Lessee may prosecute,  and
Lessor shall have no interest  in, any claim with  respect to Lessee's  personal
property and equipment and Lessee's relocation expenses.

delivered to Lessor pursuant to any Operative Document shall have been incorrect
in any material respect when made; and

                  (k)  Lessee  shall  fail in any  material  respect  to  timely
perform or observe any  covenant,  condition or agreement  (not  included in any
other  clause of this  Article) to be  performed  or observed by it hereunder or
under the other Operative Documents and such failure shall continue for a period
of 45 days after Lessee's receipt of written notice thereof from Lessor.

                                   ARTICLE XIV
                                   ENFORCEMENT

         SECTION 14.1  Remedies.  Upon the  occurrence  of any Event of Default,
Lessor  may, so long as such Event of Default is  continuing,  do one or more of
the following as Lessor in its sole discretion shall determine, without limiting
any other right or remedy Lessor may have on account of such Event of Default.

                  (a) Lessor may, by notice to Lessee, rescind or terminate this
Lease as of the date specified in such notice;  provided,  however,  that (i) no
reletting, reentry or taking of possession of the Leased Property by Lessor will
be  construed as an election on Lessor's  part to terminate  this Lease unless a
written notice of such intention is given to Lessee,  (ii)  notwithstanding  any
reletting,  reentry or taking of possession,  Lessor may at any time  thereafter
elect to terminate this Lease for a continuing Event of Default and (iii) no act
or thing done by Lessor or any of its agents,  representatives  or employees and
no agreement  accepting a surrender of the Leased Property shall be valid unless
the same be made in writing and executed by Lessor.

                  (b) Lessor may (i) demand that  Lessee,  and Lessee shall upon
the written demand of Lessor,  return the Leased Property  promptly to Lessor in
the manner and condition  required by, and  otherwise in accordance  with all of
the  provisions  of,  this  Lease  hereof as if the Leased  Property  were being
returned  at the end of the Lease Term,  and Lessor  shall not be liable for the
reimbursement  of  Lessee  for any  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by Lessee in
connection therewith and (ii) without prejudice to any other remedy which Lessor
may have for  possession  of the Leased  Property,  and to the extent and in the
manner  permitted by  Applicable  law,  enter upon the Leased  Property and take
immediate  possession of (to the exclusion of Lessee) the Leased Property or any
part  thereof  and  expel or  remove  Lessee  and any  other  Person  who may be
occupying the Leased Property, by summary proceedings or otherwise,  all without
liability  to Lessee  for or by reason  of such  entry or taking of  possession,
whether  for the  restoration  of damage to  property  caused by such  taking or
otherwise  and,  in  addition  to  Lessor's  other  damages,   Lessee  shall  be
responsible  for the reasonable and documented  costs and expenses of reletting,
including   brokers  fees  and  the  reasonable  and  documented  costs  of  any
alterations or repairs made by Lessor.

                  (c) Lessor may sell all or any part of the Leased  Property at
public or private sale, as Lessor may determine, free and clear of any rights of
Lessee and without any duty to account to Lessee with  respect to such action or
inaction or any proceeds with respect thereto in which event Lessee's obligation
to pay Basic Rent hereunder for periods  commencing  after the date of such sale
shall be terminated or proportionately reduced, as the case may be.

                                       18

<PAGE>

                  (d) Lessor  may,  at its option,  elect not to  terminate  the
Lease,  and continue to collect all Basic Rent,  Additional  Rent,  Supplemental
Rent and all other amounts due Lessor  (together  with all costs of  collection)
and enforce  Lessee's  obligations  under this Lease as and when the same become
due, or are to be performed,  and at the option of Lessor,  upon any abandonment
of the Leased  Property by Lessee or re-entry of same by Lessee,  Lessor may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, elect not to terminate this Lease and may make
such reasonable  alterations and necessary  repairs in order to relet the Leased
Property,  and relet the Leased  Property  or any part  thereof for such term or
terms (which may be for a long term extending beyond the term of this Lease) and
at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and  conditions as Lessor in
its  reasonable  discretion  may deem  advisable.  Upon each such  reletting all
rentals  actually  received  by Lessor from such  reletting  shall be applied to
Lessee's obligations hereunder in such order,  proportion and priority as Lessor
may elect in Lessor's sole and absolute  discretion,  it being agreed that under
no  circumstances  shall  Lessee  benefit  from its default from any increase in
market rents and if such rentals  received from such  reletting  during any Rent
Period  be less  than the Rent to be paid  during  that  Rent  Period  by Lessee
hereunder,  Lessee shall pay any deficiency,  to Lessor on the Rent Payment Date
in such Rent Period.

                  (e) Lessor may  exercise any other right or remedy that may be
available to it under  applicable  law, or proceed by  appropriate  court action
(legal or equitable)  to enforce the terms hereof or to recover  damages for the
breach  hereof.  Separate  suits may be brought to collect any such damages with
respect  to any Rent  Payment  Date,  and such  suites  shall not in any  manner
prejudice  Lessor's  right to collect any such damages for any  subsequent  Rent
Payment  Date,  or Lessor may defer any such suit until after the  expiration of
the Lease  Term,  in which  event such suit shall be deemed not to have  accrued
until the expiration of the Lease Term.

                  (f) Lessor may retain and apply against  Lessor's  damages all
sums which Lessor  would,  absent such Event of Default,  be required to pay, or
turn over, to Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Lease.

         SECTION 14.2 Remedies Cumulative;  No Waiver;  Consents.  To the extent
permitted by, and subject to the mandatory requirements of, applicable law, each
and  every  right  power  and  remedy  herein  specifically  given to  Lessor or
otherwise  in this Lease shall be  cumulative  and shall be in addition to every
other  right,  power and remedy  herein  specifically  given or now or hereafter
existing at law, in equity or by statute,  and each and every  right,  power and
remedy whether  specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised
from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed  expedient  by
Lessor, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy
shall not be  construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time
or thereafter any right,  power or remedy. No delay or omission by Lessor in the
exercise  of any right,  power or remedy or in the  pursuit of any remedy  shall
impair any such  right,  power or remedy or be  construed  to be a waiver of any
default on the part of Lessee or to be an acquiescence therein. Lessor's consent
to any request made by Lessee shall not be deemed to  constitute or preclude the
necessity  for  obtaining  Lessor's  consent,  in the  future,  to  all  similar
requests. No express or implied

                                       19

<PAGE>

waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default shall in any way be, or be construed to
be, a waiver of any future or subsequent  Potential Event of Default or Event of
Default.  To the extent  permitted by applicable  law,  Lessee hereby waives any
rights now or  hereafter  conferred  by statute or  otherwise  that may  require
Lessor to sell,  lease or otherwise  use the Leased  Property or part thereof in
mitigation  of Lessor's  damages upon the  occurrence  of an Event of Default or
that may otherwise limit or modify any of Lessor's rights or remedies under this
Article.

                                   ARTICLE XV
                           RIGHT TO PERFORM FOR LESSEE

         If Lessee  shall fail to perform or comply  with any of its  agreements
contained  herein,  Lessor may, on thirty (30) days prior notice (or such lesser
period  afforded by  Applicable  laws or any third party) to Lessee,  perform or
comply  with such  agreement,  and  Lessor  shall not  thereby be deemed to have
waived any default  caused by such  failure,  and the amount of such payment and
the amount of the expenses of Lessor (including  reasonable  attorney's fees and
expenses)  incurred in  connection  with such payment or the  performance  of or
compliance with such agreement, as the case may be, shall be deemed Supplemental
Rent,  payable by Lessee to Lessor  within ten (10) days  after  written  demand
therefor.

                                   ARTICLE XVI
                              GENERAL TAX INDEMNITY

nature  whatsoever,  together with any penalties,  fines or interest  thereon or
additions  thereto (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as "Taxes" and

"Taxes"  includes  amounts imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against each Tax
Indemnitee as the result of any  prohibited  transaction,  within the meaning of
Section 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section  4975(c) of the Code,  arising out of the

                               than  amounts  currently  payable with respect to

                               or  decrease  would not have  occurred  if on the
                               Closing Date the Lessor had advanced funds to the
                               Lessee  in  the  form  of a loan  secured  by the

                               on the Closing Date the Lessor had advanced funds
                               to the  Lessee in the form of a loan  secured  by

                       (iii)   Taxes  that  result   from  any  act,   event  or

                               engaging, with respect to the Leased Property, in
                               transactions  other than those  permitted  by the
                               Operative Documents; or

                       (viii)  to  the  extent  any   interest,   penalties   or
                               additions  to tax result in whole or in part from
                               the failure of a Tax  Indemnitee to file a return
                               that  it is  required  to file  in a  proper  and
                               timely  manner,  unless such  failure (A) results
                               from  the   transactions   contemplated   by  the
                               Operative  Documents in  circumstances  where the
                               Lessee did not give timely  notice to Lessor (and
                               the Lessor otherwise had no actual  knowledge) of
                               such filing requirement that would have permitted
                               a proper and timely  filing of such return or (B)
                               results  from the failure of the Lessee to supply
                               information  necessary  for the proper and timely
                               filing  of  such  return  that  was  not  in  the
                               possession of the Lessor.

         SECTION  16.3  Procedures.  If any claim shall be made  against any Tax
Indemnitee or if any  proceeding  shall be commenced  against any Tax Indemnitee
(including a written  notice of such  proceeding)  for any Taxes as to which the
Lessee may have an indemnity  obligation pursuant to this Section, or if any Tax
Indemnitee  shall  determine  that any Taxes as to which the  Lessee may have an
indemnity  obligation  pursuant  to  this  Section  may  be  payable,  such  Tax
Indemnitee  shall promptly notify the Lessee.  The Lessee shall be entitled,  at
its expense,  to  participate  in and to the extent that the Lessee  desires to,
assume and control the defense thereof; provided, however, that the Lessee shall
have  acknowledged in writing if the contest is  unsuccessful  its obligation to
fully  indemnify  such  Tax  Indemnitee  in  respect  of  such  action,  suit or
proceeding;  and  provided,  further,  that the Lessee  shall not be entitled to
assume and control the defense of any such action,  suit or proceeding  (but the
Tax Indemnitee  shall then contest,  at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee,
on behalf of the Lessee) if and to the extent that (A) in the reasonable opinion
of such Tax Indemnitee,  such action, suit or proceeding involves any meaningful
risk of imposition of criminal  liability or any material risk of material civil
liability on such Tax  Indemnitee  or will involve a material  risk of the sale,
forfeiture or loss, or the creation,  of any Lien (other than a Permitted  Lien)
on the Leased Property or any part thereof unless the Lessee shall have posted a
bond or other security  satisfactory  to the relevant Tax Indemnities in respect
to such risk, (B) such proceeding  involves Claims not fully  indemnified by the
Lessee  which the Lessee and the Tax  Indemnitee  have been unable to sever from
the  indemnified  Claim(s),  (C)  an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and  is
continuing,  (D) such action,  suit or proceeding  involves matters which extend
beyond  or are  unrelated  to the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Operative
Documents and if determined  adversely  could be materially  detrimental  to the
interests of such Tax Indemnitee  notwithstanding  indemnification by the Lessee
or (E) such action,  suit or proceeding involves the federal or any state income
tax liability of the Tax Indemnitee.  With respect to any contests controlled by
a Tax Indemnitee, (i) if such contest relates to the federal or any state income
tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee,  such Tax Indemnitee  shall be required to
conduct  such  contest  only if the  Lessee  shall  have  provided  to such  Tax
Indemnitee an opinion of independent tax counsel  selected by the Tax Indemnitee
and reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee stating that a reasonable basis exists
to contest such claim or (ii) in the case of an appeal of an adverse

                                       23

<PAGE>

determination  of any contest  relating to any Taxes, an opinion of such counsel
to the  effect  that  such  appeal  is more  likely  than not to be  successful;
provided,  however,  such Tax Indemnitee shall in no event be required to appeal
an adverse  determination to the United States Supreme Court. The Tax Indemnitee
may  participate  in a  reasonable  manner at its own  expense  and with its own
counsel  in any  proceeding  conducted  by the  Lessee  in  accordance  with the
foregoing.  Each Tax Indemnitee  shall at the Lessee's expense supply the Lessee
with such  information,  documents  and  testimony  reasonably  requested by the
Lessee as are  necessary  or  advisable  for the  Lessee to  participate  in any
action,  suit or proceeding to the extent  permitted by this Section.  Unless an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,  no Tax Indemnitee shall
enter into any settlement or other compromise with respect to any Claim which is
entitled to be indemnified  under this Section without the prior written consent
of the Lessee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such Tax
Indemnitee waives its right to be indemnified under this Section with respect to
such Claim. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) a Tax
Indemnitee  will not be  required  to  contest  (and  the  Lessee  shall  not be
permitted to contest) a claim with respect to the  imposition of any Tax if such
Tax Indemnitee shall waive its right to indemnification  under this Section with
respect to such claim (and any related claim with respect to other taxable years
the contest of which is  precluded  as a result of such  waiver) and (ii) no Tax
Indemnitee  shall be required to contest any claim if the subject matter thereof
shall  be  of a  continuing  nature  and  shall  have  previously  been  decided
adversely,  unless  there has been a change in law which in the  opinion  of the
Lessee's counsel creates substantial  authority for the success of such contest.
Each Tax  Indemnitee  and the Lessee shall consult in good faith with each other
regarding the conduct of such contest controlled by either.

         SECTION 16.4 Credits and Refunds.  If (i) a Tax Indemnitee shall obtain
a credit or refund of any Taxes paid by the Lessee  pursuant to this  Section or
(ii) by  reason  of the  incurrence  or  imposition  of any Tax for  which a Tax
Indemnitee is indemnified hereunder or any payment made to or for the account of
such Tax Indemnitee by the Lessee pursuant to this Section,  such Tax Indemnitee
at any time  realizes  a  reduction  in any Taxes  for  which the  Lessee is not
required  to  indemnify  such Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant to this  Section,  which
reduction in Taxes was not taken into  account in computing  such payment by the
Lessee to or for the account of such Tax  Indemnitee,  then such Tax  Indemnitee
shall  promptly pay to the Lessee the amount of such credit or refund,  together
with the amount of any interest  received by such Tax  Indemnitee  on account of
such credit or refund or an amount equal to such reduction in Taxes, as the case
may be;  provided,  however,  that no such  payment  shall be made so long as an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;  and provided,  further,
that the amount  payable to the Lessee by any Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant  to this
subsection  shall not at any time exceed the  aggregate  amount of all indemnity
payments  made by the Lessee under this Section to such Tax  Indemnitee  and all
related Tax Indemnities with respect to the Taxes which gave rise to a credit or
refund or with  respect to the Tax which gave rise to a reduction  in Taxes less
the amount of all prior  payments made to the Lessee by such Tax  Indemnitee and
related Tax Indemnities under this Section. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to act in
good faith to claim such refunds and other available Tax benefits, and take such
other  actions as may be  reasonable to minimize any payment due from the Lessee
pursuant to this Section and to maximize the amount of any Tax savings available
to it. The disallowance or reduction of any credit,  refund or other tax savings
with  respect to which a Tax  Indemnitee  has made a payment to the Lessee under
this

                                       24

<PAGE>

subsection  shall be  treated  as a Tax for which the  Lessee  is  obligated  to
indemnify such Tax Indemnitee hereunder.

         SECTION 16.5 Payments.  Any Tax indemnifiable  under this Section shall
be paid directly when due to the applicable  taxing  authority if direct payment
is  practicable  and  permitted.  If direct  payment  to the  applicable  taxing
authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made, any amount payable to a Tax
Indemnitee  pursuant to this Section shall be paid within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written demand  therefor from such Tax Indemnitee  accompanied by a
written statement describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable, but not
before the date that the relevant  Taxes are due. Any payments  made pursuant to
this Section shall be made directly to the Tax  Indemnitee  entitled  thereto or
the Lessor,  as the case may be, in immediately  available funds at such bank or
to such account as specified  by the payee in written  directions  to the payor,
or, if no such direction shall have been given, by check of the payor payable to
the order of the payee by certified mail,  postage prepaid at its address as set
forth in this Agreement.  Upon the request of any Tax Indemnitee with respect to
a Tax that the Lessee is required to pay, the Lessee  shall  furnish to such Tax
Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of a receipt for Lessee's payment of
such Tax or such other  evidence of payment as is reasonably  acceptable to such
Tax Indemnitee.

         SECTION 16.6 Reports,  Returns and  Statements.  If the Lessee knows of
any report,  return or statement  required to be filed with respect to any Taxes
that are subject to indemnification under this Section, the Lessee shall, if the
Lessee is  permitted  by  Applicable  law,  timely file such  report,  return or
statement  (and, to the extent  permitted by law,  show  ownership of the Leased
Property in the Lessee); provided,  however, that if the Lessee is not permitted
by Applicable  law or does not have access to the  information  required to file
any such  report,  return or  statement  the Lessee will  promptly so notify the
appropriate Tax Indemnitee,  in which case Tax Indemnitee will file such report.
In any case in which the Tax  Indemnitee  will file any such  report,  return or
statement,  Lessee shall,  upon written request of such Tax Indemnitee,  provide
such Tax  Indemnitee  with such  information  as is reasonably  available to the
Lessee.

                                  ARTICLE XVII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 17.1 Reports.  To the extent required under  applicable law and
to the  extent it is  reasonably  practical  for Lessee to do so,  Lessee  shall
prepare and file in timely fashion, or, where such filing is required to be made
by Lessor or it is otherwise  not  reasonably  practical for Lessee to make such
filing,  Lessee shall  prepare and deliver to Lessor (with a copy to the Lender)
within a reasonable time prior to the date for filing and Lessor shall file, any
material  reports  with  respect to the  condition  or  operation  of the Leased
Property that shall be required to be filed with any governmental authority.

         SECTION 17.2 Binding  Effect;  Successors  and Assigns;  Survival.  The
terms and provisions of this Lease,  and the respective  rights and  obligations
hereunder  of  Lessor  and  Lessee,  shall  be  binding  upon  their  respective
successors, legal representatives and assigns, (including, in the

                                       25

<PAGE>

case of Lessor,  any Person to whom Lessor may transfer  the Leased  Property or
any  interest  therein  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of the  Operative
Documents),  and inure to the benefit of their respective  permitted  successors
and assigns,  and the rights  hereunder of the Trustee  shall inure  (subject to
such  conditions  as are  contained  herein)  to the  benefit  of the  Trustee's
permitted successors and assigns.

         SECTION 17.3 Quite  Enjoyment.  Lessor  covenants  that,  so long as no
Event of Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  it will not  interfere  in
Lessee's or any of its  subLessees'  quiet  enjoyment of the Leased  Property in
accordance  with this Lease during the Lease Term. Such right of quiet enjoyment
is independent of, and shall not affect,  Lessor's rights  otherwise to initiate
legal action to enforce the obligations of Lessee under this Lease.

         SECTION 17.4 Notices.  Unless otherwise  specified herein, all notices,
offers,   acceptances,   rejections,   consents,   requests,  demands  or  other
communications  to or upon the  respective  parties hereto shall be given in the
manner provided for in the Note Purchase Agreement.

         SECTION 17.5  Severability.  Any  provision of this Lease that shall be
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof  and any  such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction,  and Lessee shall remain
liable  to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  except  to the  extent of such
unenforceability.  To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  Lessee  hereby
waives any  provision of law that renders any  provision  hereof  prohibited  or
unenforceable in any respect.

         SECTION 17.6 Amendment; Complete Agreements. Neither this Lease nor any
of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived or modified
orally,  except by an  instrument  in  writing  signed by Lessor  and Lessee and
approved  by ADESA and by the  Trustee as provided  for in the  Indenture.  This
Lease,  together with the other Operative Documents,  is intended by the parties
as a final  expression of their lease  agreement and as a complete and exclusive
statement  of  the  terms  thereof,   all   negotiations,   considerations   and
representations between the parties having been incorporated herein and therein.
No course of prior dealings  between the parties or their  officers,  employees,
agents or Affiliates shall be relevant or admissible to supplement,  explain, or
vary any of the terms of this Lease or any other Operative Document.  Acceptance
of, or acquiescence in, a course of performance rendered under this or any prior
agreement  between  the  parties or their  Affiliates  shall not be  relevant or
admissible  to  determine  the  meaning of any of the terms of this Lease or any
other Operative Document. No representations,  undertakings,  or agreements have
been  made or  relied  upon  in the  making  of  this  Lease  other  than  those
specifically set forth in the Operative Documents.

                                       26

<PAGE>

         SECTION  17.7  Construction.  This Lease  shall not be  construed  more
strictly  against any one party,  it being  recognized  that both of the Parties
hereto have  contributed  substantially  and materially to the  preparation  and
negotiation of this Lease.

         SECTION  17.8  Headings.  The Table of  Contents  and  headings  of the
various  Articles  and Sections of this Lease are for  convenience  of reference
only and shall  not  modify,  define  or limit  any of the  terms or  provisions
hereof.

         SECTION  17.9  Counterparts.  This Lease may be executed by the parties
hereto in separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed and  delivered
shall be an original,  but all such counterparts  shall together  constitute but
one and the same instrument.

         SECTION  17.10  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS LEASE  SHALL IN ALL  RESPECTS  BE
GOVERNED  BY,  AND  CONSTRUED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE  LAWS OF THE  STATE OF
MASSACHUSETTS  APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN
SUCH STATE, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION,  VALIDITY,  PERFORMANCE,  THE
CREATION  OF THE  LEASEHOLD  ESTATE  HEREUNDER  AND THE  EXERCISE  OF RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ESTATE.

         SECTION  17.11  Discharge of Lessee's  Obligations  by its  Affiliates.
Lessor agrees that performance of any of Lessee's  obligations  hereunder by one
or more of  Lessee's  Affiliates  or one or more of Lessee's  subLessees  of the
Leased  Property or any part thereof shall  constitute  performance by Lessee of
such  obligations  to the same extent and with the same effect  hereunder  as if
such obligations were performed by Lessee,  but no such performance shall excuse
Lessee  from any  obligation  not  performed  by it or on its  behalf  under the
Operative Documents.

         SECTION  17.12  Liability  of  Lessor  Limited.   Except  as  otherwise
expressly provided below in this Section, it is expressly  understood and agreed
by and between Lessee,  Lessor and their respective  successors and assigns that
nothing herein  contained shall be construed as creating any liability of Lessor
or any of  its  Affiliates  or any  of  their  respective  officers,  directors,
employees or agents, individually or personally, to perform any covenant, either
express  or  implied,  contained  herein,  all  such  liability,  if any,  being
expressly  waived  by  Lessee  and by each and  every  Person  now or  hereafter
claiming by,  through or under  Lessee and that,  so far as Lessor or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,  employees or agents,
individually  or personally,  is concerned,  Lessee and any Person  claiming by,
through or under  Lessee  shall look solely to the right,  title and interest of
Lessor in the Leased Property and any proceeds from Lessor's sale or encumbrance
thereof or the  Additional  Rent  (provided,  however,  that Lessee shall not be
entitled to any double  recovery) for the  performance of any  obligation  under
this  Lease  and under  the  Operative  Documents  and the  satisfaction  of any
liability arising therefrom.

         SECTION 17.13 Estoppel  Certificates.  Each party hereto agrees that at
any time and from time to time during the Lease Term, it will  promptly,  but in
no event later than thirty (30) days

                                       27

<PAGE>

after request by the other party  hereto,  execute,  acknowledge  and deliver to
such  other  party  or  to  the  Lender,  any  prospective  purchaser  (if  such
prospective  purchaser  has signed a commitment  or letter of intent to purchase
the Leased  Property or any part thereof),  assignee or mortgagee or third party
designated  by such other party,  a  certificate  stating (i) that this Lease is
unmodified  and in force and effect (or if there have been  modifications,  that
this Lease is in force and effect as modified,  and identifying the modification
agreements),  (ii) the date to which  Basic  Rent and  Additional  Rent has been
paid,  (iii)  whether  or not  there is any  existing  default  by Lessee in the
payment of Basic Rent and Additional  Rent or any other sum of money  hereunder,
and  whether or not there is any other  existing  default  by either  party with
respect to which a notice of default  has been  served and, if there is any such
default,  specifying the nature and extent thereof,  (iv) whether or not, to the
knowledge  of the signer  after due  inquiry  and  investigation,  there are any
setoffs,  defenses or counterclaims against enforcement of the obligations to be
performed  hereunder  existing in favor of the party executing such  certificate
and (v) other items that may be reasonably requested; provided, however, that no
such  certificate may be requested  unless the requesting party has a good faith
reason for such request.

         SECTION 17.14 No Joint Venture. Any intention to create a joint venture
or  partnership   relation   between  Lessor  and  Lessee  is  hereby  expressly
disclaimed.

         SECTION 17.15 No Accord and  Satisfaction.  The acceptance by Lessor of
any sums from Lessee  (whether as Basic Rent or  otherwise) in amounts which are
less than the amounts due and payable by Lessee  hereunder is not intended,  nor
shall any such acceptance be construed, to constitute an accord and satisfaction
of any  dispute  between  Lessor and Lessee  regarding  sums due and  payable by
Lessee hereunder, unless Lessor specifically deems it as such in writing.

         SECTION  17.16 No Merger.  In no event shall the  leasehold  interests,
estates  or rights of Lessee  hereunder  merge  with any  interests,  estates or
rights of Lessor in or to the Leased  Property,  it being  understood  that such
leasehold  interests,  estates and rights of Lessee hereunder shall be deemed to
be separate and distinct  from Lessor's  interests,  estates and rights in or to
the Leased Property, notwithstanding, that any such interests, estates or rights
shall at any time or times be held by or vested in the same person,  corporation
or other entity.

         SECTION 17.17 Survival. The obligations of Lessee to be performed under
this Lease prior to the Lease  Termination  Date shall survive the expiration or
termination  of  this  Lease.  The  extension  of  any  applicable   statute  of
limitations by Lessor, Lessee or any Indemnitee shall not affect such survival.

         SECTION 17.18 Prior  Mortgages.  This Lease is and shall be subject and
subordinate to that certain Mortgage and Security Agreement, dated as of _______
__, 199_, by Lessor in favor of the Trustee encumbering the Leased Property, and
to all rights of the Trustee  thereunder,  and to all  renewals,  modifications,
consolidations,  amendments,  increases,  replacements  and  extensions  thereof
("Mortgage").

                                       28

<PAGE>

         Lessee  agrees to  perform  all of the  obligations  of Lessor  (in its
capacity  as grantor)  set forth in the  Mortgage,  insofar as such  obligations
relate,  directly or  indirectly,  to the Leased  Property,  whether or not such
obligations  are more onerous than the  obligations  imposed upon Lessee by this
Lease.

         Whenever any provision of this Lease requires any consent,  approval or
agreement  of the  Lessor,  such  requirement  shall be  deemed to  include  the
consent, approval or agreement of the Trustee, so long as the Mortgage shall not
have been discharged.

         SECTION 17.19  Time of Essence. Time is of the essence of this Lease.

         SECTION 17.20  Recordation of Lease. Lessee will, at its expense, cause
a Memorandum of this Lease and the Purchase  Option to be recorded in the proper
office or offices in the State of  Massachusetts  and the  municipality in which
the Land is located.

                     GUARANTY AND PURCHASE OPTION AGREEMENT

                                November 28, 1994


         This is a GUARANTY AND PURCHASE  OPTION  AGREEMENT dated as of the date
first  written  above  ("Agreement")  by and between  Asset  Holdings  III, L.P.
("Company"),  an Ohio limited partnership,  and ADESA Corporation ("Guarantor"),
an Indiana corporation.

         The  Company  and PNC Bank,  Kentucky,  Inc.  ("Trustee"),  a  Kentucky
banking  corporation,  are parties to a Collateral  Trust  Indenture dated as of
November 22, 1994  ("Indenture").  Except as otherwise  specifically  defined in
this Agreement,  terms defined in the Collateral  Trust Indenture shall have the
same definition when used in this Agreement.

         The Company,  the Guarantor and Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company
("Purchaser")  are parties to a Note  Purchase  Agreement  dated as November 22,
1994  ("Note  Purchase  Agreement").  Certain  provisions  of the Note  Purchase
Agreement are  specifically  referred to in this Agreement and are  incorporated
herein by such  reference,  subject in each case to any subsequent  amendment or
modification thereto adopted as provided for in the Note Purchase Agreement.

                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

         A. The Company will purchase the Land and  Improvements  comprising the
Charlotte   Property,   the  Knoxville  Property  and  the  Framingham  Property
(collectively,  the "Leased Properties" and individually,  a "Leased Property"),
and will lease such Properties to  ADESA-Charlotte,  Inc.,  A.D.E. of Knoxville,
Inc., and Auto Dealers Exchange of Concord,  Inc.,  respectively  (collectively,
the "Lessees" and  individually,  a "Lessee")  pursuant to the Charlotte  Lease,
Knoxville  Lease  and the  Framingham  Lease,  respectively  (collectively,  the
"Leases" and  individually,  a "Lease").  Each of the Lessees is a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Guarantor.

         B. The purchase  price for each Leased Property,  together with certain
expenses  to  be  incurred  by  the  applicable   Lessee  with  respect  to  the
construction and renovation of the Improvements  thereon,  will be funded by the
Company, as follows: 3% out of the contributed equity capital of the Company (an
aggregate of $795,000); and 97% out of the proceeds of the Notes to be purchased
by the  Purchaser  pursuant  to the  terms of the Note  Purchase  Agreement  (an
aggregate of  $25,705,000).  The aggregate  purchase price paid or to be paid by
the Company with respect to the Leased  Properties,  including the  Construction
Funds  to be  advanced  by the  Company  to the  Guarantor  and the  Lessees  in
connection with the  Construction  (as defined in each Lease as applicable),  is
$26,500,000 ("Original Purchase Amount"), which Original Purchase Amount has and
will be funded $25,705,000 out of the proceeds of the Notes ("Original Principal
Amount")  and  $795,000  out of the  contributed  equity  capital of the Company
("Original Capital Amount").
                  
         C.       As  provided  for  in  the  Note  Purchase  Agreement,  the  
Guarantor has  unconditionally  and  absolutely  guaranteed to the Purchaser the
payment of the Notes and  performance of the other  Guaranteed  Obligations  (as
defined in the Note Purchase Agreement).

<PAGE>



         D. Pursuant to the  Indenture,  the Trustee will hold the Mortgages and
the Lease  Assignments  with respect to the Leased  Properties and the Leases in
trust as security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations,
and all payments of Basic Rent (in an amount equal to the interest  payments due
and payable  with  respect to the Notes) and  Supplemental  Rent (as defined and
provided  for in the  Leases)  will be paid to the Trustee  for  application  as
provided for therein.  Additional Rent will be paid directly to the Company,  as
Lessor under the Leases.

         E. This  Agreement  provides  for (i) the  unconditional  and  absolute
guarantee by the Guarantor of the payment and  performance by each Lessee of its
obligations  under  its  Lease,  and (ii) the  option  of the  Guarantor  or its
designee  (including  the Lessee) to purchase or remarket each of the Properties
at the end of the Lease Term (as  defined  and  provided  for in the  applicable
Lease),  and (iii) the obligation of the Guarantor to indemnify the Company with
respect to certain taxes and other obligations with respect to any of the Leased
Properties that are not purchased by the Guarantor or its designees  pursuant to
such option,  all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

                             STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

         In  consideration of the foregoing and their promises set forth in this
Agreement,  the Note  Purchase  Agreement,  the  Indenture  and the Leases,  the
Company and the Guarantor hereby agree as follows.

             SECTION 1. GUARANTY AND OTHER RIGHTS AND UNDERTAKINGS.

                  1.1      Guaranteed Obligations.

         In order to induce the Company to purchase  the  Properties,  lease the
Properties to the Lessees,  issue the Notes and enter into this  Agreement,  the
Note Purchase Agreement, the Indenture, each Lease, each Mortgage and each Lease
Assignment  and in  consideration  thereof,  the Guarantor  hereby  irrevocably,
unconditionally and absolutely  guarantees to the Company and its successors and
assigns:

                           Basic Rent, Additional Rent and Supplemental Rent and
                           any and all other  amounts due and payable  under the
                           Lease  of  each  such  Lessee  or  any   document  or
                           instrument    executed   in   connection    therewith
                           ("Relevant  Instrument"),  in each case,  when and as
                           the same  shall  become due and  payable,  whether at
                           maturity  or  prior  thereto,   by   acceleration  or
                           otherwise,  all in  accordance  with  the  terms  and
                           provisions of this Agreement and each such Lease;  it

                           set  forth  this  Section  1  shall  be a  continuing
                           guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection;
                           and

of this Section 1.1 are referred to as the "Guaranteed Lease Obligations."

         In the  event any  Lessee  fails to pay,  perform,  keep,  observe,  or
fulfill any Guaranteed Lease Obligation in the manner provided in its Lease, the
Guarantor shall cause forthwith to be paid the moneys, or to be performed, kept,
observed,  or  fulfilled  each of such  obligations,  in  respect  of which such
failure has occurred in accordance with the terms and provisions of such Lease.

                  1.3      Primary Obligation.

         The irrevocable,  unconditional  and absolute guaranty of the Guarantor
provided for in this Section 1 is a primary,  original and immediate  obligation
of the Guarantor and is an absolute, unconditional,  continuing, and irrevocable
guaranty of payment and  performance  and shall  remain in full force and effect
until  the  full,  final  and  indefeasible  payment  of  the  Guaranteed  Lease
Obligations  and the Guaranteed  Obligations (as defined and provided for in the
Note Purchase Agreement).

                           charged  or  collected  on any of  such  obligations,
                           provided  nothing herein  contained shall require the
                           undersigned  to make any payment which is contrary to

                  1.5      Certain Waivers of Subrogation, Reimbursement and 
                           Indemnity.

         The Guarantor  hereby  acknowledges and agrees that, until such time as
the Guaranteed Lease Obligations and the Guaranteed  Obligations (as defined and
provided for in the Note Purchase  Agreement) have been finally and indefeasibly
paid, the Guarantor shall not have any right of subrogation,  reimbursement,  or
indemnity  whatsoever in respect of the  Guaranteed  Lease  Obligations,  and no
right of  recourse  to or with  respect to any of the Leased  Properties  or any
other assets of any Lessee.  Nothing shall  discharge or satisfy the obligations
of  the  Guarantor   hereunder  except  the  full  and  final   performance  and
indefeasible  payment of the  Guaranteed  Lease  Obligations  and the Guaranteed
Obligations (as defined and provided for in the Note Purchase Agreement).

                  1.6      Invalid Payments.

         The  Guarantor  further  agrees that,  to the extent any Lessee makes a
payment or payments with respect to any Lease,  which payment or payments or any
part  thereof  are  subsequently  invalidated,  declared  to  be  fraudulent  or
preferential, set aside or required, for any of the foregoing reasons or for any
other reason, to be repaid or paid over to a custodian, trustee, receiver or any
other  party or  officer  under  any  bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,
insolvency,  readjustment  of  debt,  dissolution  or  liquidation  law  of  any
jurisdiction,  state or federal law, or any common law or equitable cause,  then
to the extent of such  payment or  repayment,  the  obligation  or part  thereof
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if said payment had not been made and the Guarantor shall be primarily liable
for such obligation.

             SECTION 2. SALE, RETURN OR PURCHASE OF LEASED PROPERTY.

                  2.1      Purchase Option.

         Subject  to the  terms,  conditions  and  provisions  set forth in this
Section,  the  Guarantor or any  Person(s)  designated  by the  Guarantor to the
Company in writing (including,  without limitation,  any Lessee(s)) ("Designated
Purchaser(s)")  shall during the Option Period  (defined  below) have the option
(the  "Purchase  Option")  to purchase  from the  Company  all of the  Company's
interest in each Leased  Property at the Purchase  Price provided for in Section
2.2 hereof, as adjusted to give effect to any deemed payment thereof as provided
for in Section 2.3 hereof  provided,  however,  that no such  designation  shall
cause the Guarantor to be released from any obligation under this Agreement,  or
any Lessee to be released from any obligation under its Lease.

         Such option must be exercised  by written  notice to the Company at any
time  during  the Option  Period,  which  exercise  shall be  irrevocable.  Such
purchase shall be closed on April 1, 2000.

         If the Purchase  Option with respect to any Lease Property is exercised
pursuant to the  foregoing,  then,  subject to the  provisions set forth in this
Section,  one such closing  date,  the Company  shall convey to such  Designated
Purchaser(s), and such Designated Purchaser(s) shall purchase from

                                       5

<PAGE>

the Company, the Company's interest in such Leased Property.  If Guarantor fails
to exercise the Purchase  Option with respect to any Leased  Property during the
applicable  Option Period,  then the Purchase  Option with respect to all Leased
Property shall thereupon  automatically  terminate without any further action of
the Company,  and the Purchase  Option with respect to all Leased Property shall
thereafter be of no force or effect.

         As used herein,  the term "Option  Period" means April 1, 1999 through

however,  that in the event of any  Complete  Taking with  respect to any Leased
Property (as defined in the applicable  Lease) occurs prior to the final year of
the Lease Term (as defined in the applicable  Lease), the Option Period shall be
deemed to commence upon the date of  determination  of such  Complete  Taking as
provided for in Section 11.3 of the applicable  Lease and extend for a period of
thirty  (30) days  thereafter,  provided  further,  that in event of a change of
control  resulting  in  prepayment  of the Notes  pursuant to Section 7.2 of the
Indenture,  the  Option  Period  shall be deemed to  commence  upon the  Control
Prepayment Date and extend for a period of ninety (90) days thereafter.

                  2.2      Determination of Purchase Price.

         In the event of the  purchase  by any  Designated  Purchaser(s)  of the
Company's interest in any Leased Property, the Purchase Price shall be deemed to
have been paid by such Designated  Purchaser(s) to the Company, and in the event
of  any  purchase  of any  Leased  Property  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of the
Remarketing Option (as defined herein),  the Guaranty Payment shall, as provided
for in Section 2.9 hereof,  be deemed to have been paid to the Company,  in each
case, to the extent of:

                           (i)      the amount of any Casualty  Credit,  if any,

                                    if any, that Guarantor  elects in writing to
                                    allocate  to  the  Purchase  Price  of  such
                                    Leased Property.

                  2.4      Purchase Procedure.

         In the  event  that any  Designated  Purchaser(s)  shall  purchase  the
Company's  interest  in any Leased  Property  pursuant  to the  exercise  of the
Purchase Option, (i) such Designated  Purchaser(s) shall accept from the Company

                  2.6      Taxes.

         In the event of any purchase of any Leased  Property  upon the exercise
of the Purchase Option,  there shall be no  apportionment  of taxes,  insurance,
utility  charges  or other  charges  payable  with  respect  to the such  Leased
Property, all of such taxes, insurance, utility or other charges due and payable
with  respect to such Leased  Property  prior to  termination  being  payable by
Designated  Purchaser(s)  hereunder and all due after such time being payable by
such Designated Purchaser(s) as the then owner of such Leased Property.

                  2.7      Remarketing Options.

         Subject to the  fulfillment  of each of the conditions set forth below,
Guarantor shall have the option (the  "Remarketing  Option")  exercisable at any
time during the  applicable  Option  Period with respect to the Purchase  Option
(and in lieu of the  exercise  of the  Purchase  Option),  to market  any Leased
Property  for the  Company  and to  procure a  purchaser  therefor.  Guarantor's
effective  exercise and consummation of the Remarketing  Option shall be subject
to the due and  timely  fulfillment  of each of the  following  provisions,  the
failure of any of which  shall  render the  Remarketing  Option and  Guarantor's
exercise thereof null and void.

                           (i)      Once  the   Guarantor   has   exercised  the
                                    Remarketing  Option as  provided,  Guarantor
                                    shall,  as exclusive  agent for the Company,
                                    use commercially  reasonable efforts to sell
                                    the   Company's   interest  in  such  Leased
                                    Property  and will  attempt  to  obtain  the
                                    highest  purchase price therefor.  Guarantor
                                    will be  responsible  for hiring brokers and
                                    making such Leased  Property  available  for
                                    inspection   by   prospective    purchasers.
                                    Guarantor   shall   promptly   provide   any
                                    maintenance  records relating to such Leased
                                    Property to the  Company  and any  potential
                                    purchaser upon request,  and shall otherwise
                                    do all things  necessary to sell and deliver
                                    possession  of such  Leased  Property to the
                                    purchaser. All such marketing of such Leased
                                    Property  shall  be  at   Guarantor's   sole
                                    expense.  Guarantor  shall allow the Company
                                    and any potential qualified purchaser access
                                    to such Leased  Property  for the purpose of
                                    inspecting the same.

                           (ii)     Guarantor  shall  submit  all  bids  to  the
                                    Company,  and the  Guarantor  will  have the
                                    right to  review  the same and the  right to
                                    submit any one or more bids.  All bids shall
                                    be on an "all-cash"  basis.  Guarantor shall
                                    procure  bids  from  one or more  bona  fide
                                    prospective  purchasers and shall deliver to
                                    the  Company  not less than ninety (90) days
                                    prior to the last day of such  Lease  Term a
                                    binding written unconditional (except as set
                                    forth  below),  irrevocable  offer  by  such
                                    purchaser  offering  the highest  "all-cash"
                                    bid to purchase such Leased Property. Such

                                    purchaser  shall  not  be  Guarantor  or any
                                    subsidiary  or affiliate of  Guarantor.  The
                                    written  offer must  specify the last day of
                                    such Lease Term as the closing date.

                           (iii)    On the last day of such Lease  Term,  Lessee
                                    shall  surrender  such  Leased  Property  as
                                    provided for herein.

                           (iv)     In  connection  with any  such  sale of such
                                    Leased  Property,  Guarantor will provide to
                                    the  purchaser   all  customary   "seller's"
                                    indemnities,  representations and warranties
                                    regarding  title,  absence of Liens  (except
                                    the  Company's  Liens) and the  condition of
                                    such  Leased  Property,  including,  without
                                    limitation,  an environmental  indemnity. As
                                    to  Company,  any such sale shall be made on
                                    an "as is,  with all faults"  basis  without
                                    representation or warranty by the Company.

                           (v)      Guarantor  shall pay directly,  and not from
                                    the sale proceeds, all prorations,  credits,
                                    costs  and  expenses  of the  sale  of  such
                                    Leased  Property,  whether  incurred  by the
                                    Company  or  Guarantor  including,   without
                                    limitation, the cost of all title insurance,
                                    surveys,  environmental reports, appraisals,
                                    transfer  taxes,  the  Company's  reasonable
                                    attorneys'  fees,   Guarantor's   attorneys'
                                    fees,  commissions,  escrow fees,  recording
                                    fees,  and all  applicable  documentary  and
                                    other transfer taxes, except those which are
                                    paid by the purchaser of such property.

                           (vi)     If the selling price of such Leased Property
                                    does not exceed the Purchase  Price for such
                                    Leased  Property as set forth in Section 2.2
                                    hereof   after   giving    effect   to   the
                                    adjustments, if any, provided for in Section
                                    2.3  hereof and after  giving  effect to the
                                    Guaranty  Payment,  if any,  provided for in
                                    Section 2.9 herein, then the Company may, by
                                    notice to Lessee and in  Company's  sole and
                                    absolute  discretion,  reject  such offer to
                                    purchase,  in which event the  parties  will
                                    proceed   according  to  the  provisions  of
                                    Section 2.8 hereof.

                           (vii)    If the Company does not reject such purchase
                                    offer as provided above, the closing of such
                                    purchase  of such  Leased  Property  by such
                                    purchaser must occur on the last day of such
                                    Lease Term,  contemporaneously with Lessee's
                                    surrender   or  such   Leased   Property  as
                                    provided for herein.

                           (viii)   If the Company  does not reject the purchase
                                    offer as provided  above,  then the purchase
                                    shall be consummated on the last day of such
                                    Lease  Term and the  gross  proceeds  of the
                                    sale (i.e., without deduction for

                                       9

<PAGE>

                                    any  marketing,   closing  or  other  costs,
                                    prorations  or  commissions)  shall  be paid
                                    directly  to the  Trustee  to be  applied as
                                    provided for in the Indenture.

         If one or more of the foregoing provisions shall not be fulfilled as of
the last day of such Lease Term or if such Leased  Property is not  purchased as
aforesaid for any other reasons whatsoever other than solely due to rejection by
the Company of such sale  pursuant to subsection  (vii) above,  then the Company
may, at Company's  option and in the Company's sole  discretion,  (i) declare by
written  notice  to the  Guarantor  the  Remarketing  Option to be null and void
(whether or not it has been  theretofore  exercised by the Guarantor),  in which
event  all of the  Guarantor's  rights  under  this  Section  shall  immediately
terminate,  or (ii) permit and require the Guarantor on behalf of the Company to
consummate the sale of such Leased  Property to such  purchaser,  in which event
the gross  proceeds  shall be paid as set forth in this  Section  and all of the
Company's  rights  and  remedies  set  forth  herein,  in  the  other  Operative
Documents,  at  law  or in  equity  or  otherwise  shall  be  preserved.  If the
prospective  purchaser breaches its offer to purchase,  then the Company may, in
the Company's sole  discretion,  declare the  Remarketing  Option to be null and
void, in which event all of Designated  Purchaser(s)'s rights under this Section
shall  immediately  terminate.  The  Guarantor  shall  have no  right,  power or
authority  to bind the  Company in  connection  with any  proposed  sale of such
Leased Property.

                  2.8      Rejection of Sale.

         Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein  to the  contrary,  if the
Company  rejects  the  purchase  offer for such  Leased  Property as provided in
Section  2.7  hereof,  then (i) the Company  shall  retain  title to such Leased
Property,  and (ii) in addition to the Guarantor's other obligations  hereunder,
the Guarantor  will  reimburse the Company,  within ten (10) Business Days after

        during the preceding fiscal quarter until ADESA's  financial  statements
        for the  preceding  fiscal  quarter are  delivered to the Agent.  On the

        statements in any fiscal  quarter,  an appropriate  adjustment  shall be
        made for interest  accrued and paid on prior  interest  payment dates in

        payment  then due and  payable by ADESA to the Banks and any  deficiency

        Letter of Credit.  For the avoidance of doubt it is noted that it is the

        Section 2. THE LOANS. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Banks severally agree to make the loans described in this Section
to ADESA:

a.      ADESA Revolver. The Banks severally will make a revolving loan available
        to ADESA on the following terms and conditions:

           (i)    The ADESA Revolver Commitment. From the date hereof, and until
                  the Banking Day next  preceding the Maturity  Date,  the Banks
                  will make  Advances  from time to time to ADESA of amounts not
                  exceeding, in the aggregate at any time outstanding, Fifty-Two
                  Million and No/100  Dollars  ($52,000,000)  as  increased  and
                  decreased  from time to time as  hereinafter  set forth.  All
                  Advances hereunder are collectively  referred to as the "ADESA
                  Revolver"  and  the  maximum  principal  amount  that  may  be
                  outstanding  under  the  ADESA  Revolver  as of any date  such
                  amount  is to be  determined  is  referred  to as  the  "ADESA
                  Revolver  Commitment".  The ADESA Revolver Commitment shall be
                  made  available to ADESA as follows:  Advances under Tranche A
                  shall  be  available  up to an  initial  principal  amount  of
                  $12,000,000  from the date  hereof  until  October 1, 1995 and
                  increasing to  $25,000,000  from October 1, 1995 until January
                  1, 1996, and  increasing to  $32,000,000  from January 1, 1996
                  until the Maturity  Date.  Advances  under  Tranche B shall be
                  available  up to an initial  principal  amount of  $20,000,000
                  from the date hereof  until  October 1, 1995 on which date and
                  on each  subsequent  January 1, April 1, July 1 and  October 1
                  thereafter  until the Maturity Date, the amount  available for
                  Advances  under Tranche B shall  decrease by $715,000.  In the
                  event that  Advances  outstanding  under  Tranche B exceed the
                  amount  available  on each  January  1,  April  1,  July 1 and
                  October 1 after giving  effect to the required  reduction  set
                  forth  above,  ADESA shall on such dates and  without  demand,
                  immediately repay such excess to the Agent for the

                                      13
<PAGE>


                  ratable  benefit  of the Banks  entitled  thereto.  All of the
                  Conditions   of  Lending   set  forth  in  Section  8  hereof,
                  applicable  to the  ADESA  Revolver  must  have  been and must
                  continue to be met at the time of each Advance,  and provided,
                  further,  that no Bank  shall make  Advances  in excess of its
                  Commitment  as set forth in  Schedule A attached  hereto.  All
                  Advances  under the ADESA Revolver shall first be funded under
                  Tranche B, except for Advances  requested in Canadian dollars,
                  pursuant  to  Section  2.a.(vi)  hereof.  All  prepayments  of
                  principal shall first be applied to the outstanding  principal
                  balance  of Tranche A and no  prepayment  of Tranche B will be
                  permitted until the outstanding principal balance of Tranche A
                  is -0-.  Proceeds  of the ADESA  Revolver  may only be used to
                  restate and extend the  outstanding  indebtedness  of ADESA to
                  Bank One under the Original Agreement,  to finance acquisition
                  and/or  development of auction  locations owned or to be owned
                  by ADESA  or a  Subsidiary,  and for  expenditures  for  fixed
                  assets.

           (ii)   Method  of  Borrowing.  The  obligation  of ADESA to repay the
                  ADESA Revolver shall be evidenced by the promissory notes (The
                  "Revolving  Notes") of ADESA payable to each of the respective
                  Banks  in the  form of  Exhibit  "B".  So long as no  Event of
                  Default or Unmatured  Event of Default shall have occurred and
                  be continuing  and until the applicable  Maturity Date,  ADESA
                  may borrow,  repay or reborrow under the ADESA Revolver on any
                  Banking Day,  provided  that no borrowing  may cause the total
                  amount outstanding to exceed the ADESA Revolver  Commitment as
                  in effect from time to time as set forth in Section 2.a(i), or
                  may  result in an Event of Default  or an  Unmatured  Event of
                  Default.  Each  Advance  under  the  ADESA  Revolver  shall be
                  conditioned  upon receipt by the Agent of an  Application  for
                  Advance and an Officer's Certificate,  provided that the Agent
                  may,  at its  discretion,  make a  disbursement  upon the oral
                  request  of ADESA  made by an  Authorized  Officer,  or upon a
                  request  transmitted  to  the  Agent  by  telephone  facsimile
                  ("fax")  machine,  or by any other form of written  electronic
                  communication  (all such requests for Advances being hereafter
                  referred to as "informal  requests").  In so doing,  the Agent
                  may  rely  on any  informal  request  which  shall  have  been
                  received by it in good faith from a person resonably  believed
                  to be an Authorized  Officer.  Each informal  request shall be
                  promptly   confirmed  by  a  duly  executed   Application  and
                  Officer's  Certificate  if the Agent so requires  and shall in
                  and of itself  constitute the  representation of ADESA that no
                  Event of Default or  Unmatured  Event of Default has  occurred
                  and is  continuing  or would  result  from the  making  of the
                  rquested Advance and that the making of the requested  Advance
                  shall not cause the principal balance of the ADESA Revolver to
                  exceed  the ADESA  Revolver  Commitment.  All  borrowings  and
                  reborrowings  and all  repayments  shall be in  amounts of not
                  less than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars

                                      14

                  ($250,000),  except  for  repayment  of the  entire  principal
                  balance  of the ADESA  Revolver.  The  principal  of the ADESA
                  Revolver may be prepaid at any time, subject to the payment of
                  the Prepayment  Premium,  if  applicable,  pursuant to Section
                  2.c(iii).  Upon  receipt and approval of an  Application,  the
                  Agent  shall  make  an  Advance  in  the  amount  approved  in
                  accordance with the  instructions in the Application and shall
                  be  made  ratably  from  the  Banks  in  proportion  to  their
                  respective Commitments in accordance with Section 2.d. hereof.
                  The Agent  shall give  prompt  telephonic,  telex or  telecopy
                  notice to each of the Banks of any  Advance  request  received
                  from ADESA and,  if such notice  requests  the Banks to make a
                  LIBOR-based Rate Advance or an  Interbank-based  Rate Advance,
                  the Agent  shall give notice to ADESA and each of the Banks by
                  any such means of the interest rate  applicable  thereto (but,
                  if such notice is given by telephone,  the Agent shall confirm
                  such rate in writing)  promptly  after the Agent has made such
                  determination  of the  applicable  rate.  All  Advances by the
                  Banks and  payments by ADESA shall be recorded by the Banks on
                  their books and records,  and the principal amount outstanding
                  from time to time,  plus interest  payable  thereon,  shall be
                  determined by reference to the books and records of the Banks.
                  The Banks' and  Agent's  books and  records  shall be presumed
                  prima facie to be correct as to such matters.

           (iii)  Interest on the ADESA  Revolver.  The principal  amount of the
                  ADESA  Revolver  outstanding  from  time  to time  shall  bear
                  interest  until  maturity of the ADESA  Revolver at a rate per
                  annum  equal to the  Prime-based  Rate,  except that ADESA may
                  elect  to  have  interest  accrue  at a  LIBOR-based  Rate  in
                  accordance with Section 2.c. hereof.  After maturity,  whether
                  on the Maturity  Date or on account of  acceleration  upon the
                  occurrence of an Event of Default, and until paid in full, the
                  ADESA  Revolver  shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal
                  to the Prime-based Rate plus two percent (2%),  except that as
                  to any portion of the ADESA  Revolver for which ADESA may have
                  elected a LIBOR-based Rate for an Interest Period that has not
                  expired  at  maturity,   or  after  such   determination,   as
                  applicable,  such portion shall,  during the remainder of such
                  Interest   Period,   bear  interest  at  the  greater  of  the
                  Prime-based  Rate  plus two  percent  (2%) per annum or at the
                  LIBOR-based  Rate,  plus two percent  (2%) per annum.  Accrued
                  interest  shall  be due and  payable  quarterly  on the  first
                  Banking Day of each  October,  January,  April and July and at
                  maturity,  except that interest accruing at a LIBOR-based Rate
                  shall be payable as set forth in Section 2.c (ii) and interest
                  accruing  at an  Interbank-based  Rate shall be payable as set
                  forth in Section  2.a(vi).  After maturity,  interest shall be
                  payable as accrued and without demand.

           (iv)   Extensions of Maturity  Date.  The Banks may, upon the request
                  of  ADESA,  but at the  Banks'  sole  discretion,  extend  the
                  Maturity Date of the

                                      15
<PAGE>


                  ADESA  Revolver from time to time to such date or dates as the
                  Banks may elect by notice in  writing  to ADESA,  and upon any
                  such extension and upon execution and delivery by ADESA of new
                  ADESA Revolving Notes  reflecting the extended  maturity date,
                  the  date to  which  the  ADESA  Revolver  Commitment  is then
                  extended will become the "Maturity  Date" for purposes of this
                  Agreement.

           (v)    Closing  Fee and  Unused  Commitment  Fee.  ADESA  shall pay a
                  closing  fee equal to .125%  per annum on the total  amount of
                  the  ADESA  Revolver  Commitment  ($52,000,000).  ADESA  shall
                  further  pay to the  Agent,  for the pro rata  benefit  of the
                  Banks,  the  Unused  Commitment  Fee  on  the  ADESA  Revolver
                  Commitment  as in  effect  from  time to time as set  forth in
                  Section 2.a(i),  payable  quarterly in arrears on each July 1,
                  October  1,  January 1 and April 1,  while the ADESA  Revolver
                  Commitment is  outstanding,  commencing  October 1, 1995. Such
                  fees may be debited by the Agent on or after  thirty (30) days
                  of the date when  due,  if not  earlier  paid,  to any  demand
                  deposit  account  of  ADESA  carried  with the  Agent  without
                  further authority.  After any such debit, the Agent shall give
                  ADESA  prompt  notice  of the  debit  and a  statement  of the
                  calculation  of such fees, but any failure to give such notice
                  shall not affect the validity or enforceability thereof.

           (vi)   Sublimit for Canadian Dollar Loans. Up to U.S. Ten Million and
                  No/100  Dollars (U.S.  $10,000,000)  of Tranche A of the ADESA
                  Revolver may be funded in equivalent Canadian dollars, only in
                  accordance  with this  Section  2.a(vi) and  provided  that No
                  Event of Default or  Unmatured  Event of Default has  occurred
                  and is continuing or may result therefrom.

                      (A) Upon three (3) Banking  Days prior  written  notice to
                      the  Agent,  ADESA may  request  an  advance  in  Canadian
                      dollars in a minimum  principal  amount of equivalent U.S.
                      Two  Million   Five   Hundred   Thousand   Dollars   (U.S.
                      $2,500,000)  and  integral  multiples   thereof,   for  an
                      applicable   Interest   Period.   Each  Advance  shall  be
                      evidenced  by a Canadian  dollar Note (the  "Note") in the
                      form of Exhibit "D" attached hereto.  ADESA may not select
                      an Interest  Period which ends after the Maturity Date for
                      the ADESA Revolver.  Interest on such Advance shall accrue
                      at the  Interbank-based  Rate per annum, from the date the
                      Advance is made, and shall be payable in Canadian  dollars
                      on the date occurring every three months while the Advance
                      is  outstanding  and on  the  last  day of the  respective
                      Interest  Period.  The  principal  of each Advance must be
                      repaid in Canadian dollars on the last Banking Day of each
                      Interest  Period.  Any prepayment of the principal of each
                      Advance shall be subject to the Prepayment Premium.  After
                      the

                                      16
<PAGE>


                      last  day  of  each  Interest  Period,  or on  account  of
                      acceleration  upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default,
                      each Advance  shall bear  interest at the  Interbank-based
                      Rate plus two  percent  (2%) per annum until paid in full,
                      and shall be payable as accrued  and without  demand.  The
                      Banks shall fund each  Advance  under this  Section to the
                      Agent in Canadian dollars.

                      (B) At  any  time  when  any  Advance  is  denominated  in
                      offshore  Canadian  dollars,   ADESA  shall  reimburse  or
                      compensate the Banks upon demand for all costs incurred or
                      losses  suffered  by the Banks  which are  applied  by the
                      Banks to such  Advance by reason of any and all present or
                      future  reserve,  exchange  controls,  special  deposit or
                      similar  requirements against assets or liabilities of the
                      Banks,  or  restrictions  on funding  offshore assets with
                      onshore  liabilities  (including  any  requirements  under
                      Regulation  D of the  Board of  Governors  of the  Federal
                      Reserve System).

                      (C) In the event of any failure by ADESA to pay any amount
                      in offshore  Canadian  dollars when due, the Banks may, at
                      their option,  purchase for the account of ADESA,  as soon
                      as practicable  after such failure,  an amount in Canadian
                      dollars with interest  accrued  thereon on the spot market
                      with U.S.  dollars in which case ADESA shall become liable
                      to the Banks for the amount in U.S.  dollars  so  expended
                      with  interest  thereon  at  two  percent  (2%)  over  the
                      Interbank-based  Rate.  The Banks through the Agent,  will
                      give the Borrower notice of any such exchange.

                      (D) If prior to the  commencement of any Interest  Period,
                      any Bank  determines that offshore  Canadian  dollars will
                      not be available in the offshore interbank markets,  or if
                      any   applicable   law,   order  or   regulation   or  any
                      interpretation  thereof by any  governmental  agency shall
                      make it unlawful or  impracticable  for such Bank to make,
                      maintain or fund,  the relevant  Advance,  such Bank shall
                      promptly  give  notice  thereof to ADESA and such  Advance
                      shall  be  treated  as an  Advance  under  Section  2.a(i)
                      hereof.

                      (E) ADESA  agrees to pay or cause to be paid  directly  to
                      the appropriate  governmental  authority,  or to reimburse
                      the Banks,  for the cost of any and all present and future
                      taxes,  duties,  fees  and  other  charges  of any  nature
                      whatsoever   (including  any  additional  taxes  or  other
                      charges  due  as  a   consequence   of  such   payment  or
                      reimbursement)  levied  or  imposed  by  any  governmental
                      authority   on  or  with  regard  to  any  aspect  of  the
                      transactions contemplated

                      herein, except such taxes as are imposed on or measured by
                      each  Bank's  net  income  by  the   jurisdiction  or  any
                      political   subdivision   thereof  in  which  such  Bank's
                      principal office is located.

                      (F) Whenever the  equivalent  amount in one currency  (the
                      "First  Currency")  must be determined  with respect to an
                      amount in another currency (the "Second  Currency"),  such
                      determination  shall be  based  on the  spot  rate for the
                      purchase, on the relevant date, of the First Currency with
                      the Second  Currency  quoted by the Agent's  Grand  Cayman
                      Branch, at 10:00 A.M. Grand Cayman time two (2) days prior
                      to the  relevant  date  on  which  such  foreign  exchange
                      transactions are conducted by the foreign exchange market.

b.      The Line of Credit.  The Banks  severally agree to make a revolving line
        of credit ("Line of Credit")  available to ADESA on the following  terms
        and subject to the following conditions:

           (i)    The  Commitment  -- Use of Proceeds.  From this date and until
                  the  Maturity   Date,   the  Banks  agree  to  make   Advances
                  (collectively,  the  "Line  of  Credit  Commitment")  under  a
                  revolving line of credit from time to time to ADESA of amounts
                  not   exceeding    Eighteen   Million   and   No/100   Dollars
                  ($18,000,000)  in  the  aggregate  at  any  time  outstanding,
                  provided  that all of the  Conditions  of  Lending  stated  in
                  Section 8 of this Agreement as being applicable to the Line of
                  Credit  have been  fulfilled  at the time of each  Advance and
                  provided,  further,  that no Bank will make Advances in excess
                  of its Commitment as set forth on Schedule A attached  hereto.
                  Proceeds of the line of Credit  shall be used by ADESA only to
                  fund its  working  capital  requirements  and to make  working
                  capital loans to the Subsidiaries named in the following table
                  in maximum  aggregate  amounts  outstanding  at any time as to
                  each such  Subsidiary  not to exceed the amounts  shown in the
                  table  opposite the names of the respective  Subsidiaries  and
                  for no other purpose:


                  Subsidiary                                       Maximum
                  ----------                                    Amount of Loans
                                                                ---------------

                  Auto Banc Corporation                               3,000,000


                  Proceeds of an  Advance  under the Line of Credit  may not be 
                  used to make principal reductions on the ADESA Revolver.

           (ii)   Method of Borrowing. The obligation of ADESA to repay the Line
                  of Credit  shall be  evidenced  by the  promissory  notes (the
                  "Line  of  Credit  Notes")  of  ADESA  payable  to each of the
                  respective  Banks in the form of  Exhibit  "C".  So long as no
                  Event of Default  or  Unmatured  Event of  Default  shall have
                  occurred and be continuing and until the Maturity Date.  ADESA
                  may borrow, repay and reborrow under the Line of Credit on any
                  Banking Day,  provided  that no borrowing  may cause the total
                  principal  outstanding to exceed the Line of Credit Commitment
                  or may result in an Event of Default or an Unmatured  Event of
                  Default.  Each  Advance  under  the  Line of  Credit  shall be
                  conditioned  upon  receipt  by  the  Agent  from  ADESA  of an
                  Application  for Loan  Advance and an  Officer's  Certificate,
                  provided  that  the  Agent  may,  at  its  discretion,  make a
                  disbursement  upon  the  oral  request  of  ADESA  made  by an
                  Authorized Officer, or upon a request transmitted to the Agent
                  by telephone  facsimile ("fax") machine,  or by any other form
                  of written  electronic  communication  (all such  requests for
                  Advances being hereafter referred to as "informal  requests").
                  In so doing,  the Agent may rely on any informal request which
                  shall  have been  received  by it in good  faith from a person
                  reasonably believed to be an Authorized Officer. Each informal
                  request  shall  be  promptly  confirmed  by  a  duly  executed
                  Application and Officer's Certificate if the Agent so requires
                  and shall in and of itself  constitute the  representation  of
                  ADESA that no Event of Default or  Unmatured  Event of Default
                  has occurred and is continuing or would result from the making
                  of the requested  Advance and that the making of the requested
                  Advance shall not cause the  principal  balance of the Line of
                  Credit to exceed the

                                      19
<PAGE>


                  Line of Credit Commitment. All borrowings and reborrowings and
                  all  repayments  shall  be in  amounts  of not  less  than Two
                  Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars  ($250,000),  except
                  for repayment of the entire  principal  balance of the Line of
                  Credit.   Notwithstanding   any   other   provision   of  this
                  subsection,  the Banks shall not be required to make more than
                  two Advances in any week. Upon receipt of an  Application,  or
                  at the Agent's  discretion upon receipt of an informal request
                  for an Advance and upon compliance  with any other  Conditions
                  of Lending stated in Section 8 of this Agreement applicable to
                  the Line of Credit, the Agent shall disburse the amount of the
                  requested Advance to ADESA, and shall be made ratably from the
                  Banks  in  proportion  to  their  respective   Commitments  in
                  accordance  with  Section  2.d.  hereof.  The Agent shall give
                  prompt  telephonic,  telex or  telecopy  notice to each of the
                  Banks of any Advance  request  received.  All  Advances by the
                  Banks and  payments by ADESA shall be recorded by the Banks on
                  their books and records,  and the principal amount outstanding
                  from time to time,  plus interest  payable  thereon,  shall be
                  determined by reference to the books and records of the Banks.
                  The Banks' and  Agent's  books and  records  shall be presumed
                  prima facie to be correct as to such matters.

           (iii)  Interest on the Line of Credit.  The  principal  amount of the
                  Line of  Credit  outstanding  from  time to  time  shall  bear
                  interest until maturity of the Notes at a rate per annum equal
                  to the Prime-based  Rate. After maturity,  whether on the Line
                  of Credit Maturity Date or on account of acceleration upon the
                  occurrence of an Event of Default, and until paid in full, the
                  Line of Credit  shall bear  interest at a per annum rate equal
                  to  the  Prime-based  Rate  plus  two  percent  (2%).  Accrued
                  interest shall be due and payable monthly on the first Banking
                  Day of each month and at maturity.  After  maturity,  interest
                  shall be payable as accrued and without demand.

           (iv)   Extensions of Maturity  Date.  The Banks may, upon the request
                  of ADESA, but at the Banks' sole  discretion,  extend the Line
                  of  Credit  Maturity  Date  from time to time to such date or
                  dates as the Banks may  elect by notice in  writing  to ADESA,
                  and upon any such extension and upon execution and delivery by
                  ADESA of Line of Credit Notes reflecting the extended maturity
                  date, the date to which the Line of Credit  Commitment is then
                  extended  will become the Line of Credit  "Maturity  Date" for
                  purposes of this Agreement.

           (v)    Standby Letters of Credit.  At any time that ADESA is entitled
                  to an Advance under the Line of Credit,  the Agent shall, upon
                  the  application  of ADESA,  issue for the account of ADESA, a
                  standby  letter of credit  (any  such  letter of credit  being
                  referred to in this Agreement as an "L/C") in an amount not in
                  excess of the maximum Advance that ADESA would then

                                      20

                  be entitled to obtain under the Line of Credit,  provided that
                  (i) the total  amount of L/C's  which are  outstanding  at any
                  time shall not exceed $2,000,000, (ii) the issuance of any L/C
                  with a  maturity  date  beyond  the  Maturity  Date  shall  be
                  entirely at the discretion of the Banks,  (iii) the purpose of
                  each  L/C  shall  be to  secure  to a  customer  of ADESA or a
                  Subsidiary, payment for or return of vehicles and certificates
                  of title or  certificates  of origin to vehicles  delivered to
                  ADESA or a  Subsidiary  for sale at  auction  in the  ordinary
                  course of  business  of ADESA and its  Subsidiaries,  (iv) the
                  form of the requested L/C shall be  satisfactory  to the Agent
                  in the reasonable exercise of the Agent's discretion,  and (v)
                  ADESA shall have  executed an  application  and  reimbursement
                  agreement  for the L/C (a  "Reimbursement  Agreement")  in the
                  Agent's  standard form, a copy of the current version of which
                  is attached as Exhibit  "E".  Each Bank shall  purchase a risk
                  participation in each L/C issued equal to its pro rata portion
                  of the  face  amount  of the L/C and  agrees  to  remit to the
                  Agent,  in funds  available  for immediate use by the Agent in
                  Indianapolis,  Indiana,  its pro rata  portion of each payment
                  made by the Agent on an L/C,  promptly  upon receipt of notice
                  from the Agent of such payment. The Agent shall promptly remit
                  to each Bank it pro rata  portion of all  applicable  fees and
                  reimbursements  received by the Agent from  ADESA.  ADESA will
                  pay the  Agent a  commission  for  each  standby  L/C  issued,
                  calculated  at the L/C  Commission  Rate then in effect on the
                  maximum  amount  available  to be drawn under the standby L/C,
                  which  commission shall be shared pro rata with the Banks less
                  a .125%  Agent  fee.  ADESA  shall  pay the  Agent's  standard
                  transaction fees with respect to any transactions occurring in
                  respect of any L/C's.  Transaction fees shall belong solely to
                  the Agent. Commissions shall be payable when the related L/C's
                  are  issued  and  transaction   fees  shall  be  payable  upon
                  completion  of the  transaction  as to which they are charged.
                  All such  commissions  and fees may be debited by the Agent to
                  any deposit  account of ADESA  carried with the Agent  without
                  further  authority,  and in any event,  shall be paid by ADESA
                  within ten (10) days following billing.

           (vi)   Mandatory Monthly Paydown. Notwithstanding any other provision
                  of this  Section  2.b.,  ADESA  shall  make such  payments  on
                  account of the principal  balance of the Line of Credit as may
                  be necessary so that on not less than two (2)  non-consecutive
                  Banking Days in each calendar month the outstanding  principal
                  balance of the Line of Credit  does not exceed  Seven  Million
                  Two Hundred  Thousand  and No/100  Dollars  ($7,200,000).  For
                  purposes  of this  subsection,  any  Banking  Days  which  are
                  separated  only by days  which are not  Banking  Days shall be
                  considered to be consecutive.

c.      Procedures  for  Electing   LIBOR-based  Rates  --  Certain  Effects  of
        Election.  A LIBOR-based Rate may be elected by ADESA only in accordance
        with  the  following  procedures,  shall  be  subject  to the  following
        conditions  and the  election  of a  LIBOR-based  Rate  shall  have  the
        following consequences in addition to other consequences stated in this
        Agreement:

           (i)    No  LIBOR-based  Rate may be  elected  at any time an Event of
                  Default or an Unmatured  Event of Default  shall have occurred
                  and  is  continuing.  Further,  no  LIBOR-based  Rate  may  be
                  selected for an Interest  Period  beyond the Maturity Date for
                  the ADESA Revolver.

           (ii)   A LIBOR-based Rate may only be elected on the entire principal
                  balance of the ADESA Revolver or as to any portion  thereof as
                  to which no  previous  LIBOR-based  Rate  election  remains in
                  effect, or new Advance thereunder,  in a minimum amount of One
                  Million and No/100 Dollars  ($1,000,000) or integral  multiple
                  thereof, for an applicable Interest Period.  Interest accruing
                  at a  LIBOR-based  Rate shall be  payable in arrears  (a) with
                  respect to Interest  Periods of three  months or less,  on the
                  last  day of the  Interest  Period  and (b)  with  respect  to
                  Interest  Periods  longer  than three  months,  on the date(s)
                  occurring  every  three  months  and  on the  last  day of the
                  Interest Period.

           (iii)  Voluntary prepayment prior to scheduled maturity of all or any
                  portion of the ADESA Revolver on which interest is accruing at
                  a LIBOR-based Rate shall be subject to contemporaneous payment
                  of the Prepayment  Premium if, at the time of prepayment,  the
                  Reinvestment  Rate is less than the LIBOR-based  Rate at which
                  interest accrues on the ADESA Revolver.  A Prepayment  Premium
                  shall  also be due and  payable  on  prepayment  of all or any
                  portion  of the ADESA  Revolver  prior to  scheduled  maturity
                  because of acceleration of maturity on account of an Event of
                  Default  if,  at the time of  acceleration  of  maturity,  the
                  Reinvestment  Rate is less than the LIBOR-based  Rate at which
                  interest is accruing on the ADESA Revolver.  If at the time of
                  any  voluntary or mandatory  prepayment  of any portion of the
                  principal of the ADESA  Revolver,  interest  accrues at both a
                  LIBOR-based  Rate and at a Prime-based Rate on portions of the
                  ADESA  Revolver,  then any  prepayment  of  principal  will be
                  applied  first to the  portion of the ADESA  Revolver on which
                  interest  accrues  at the  Prime-based  Rate  and  next to the
                  portion or portions at which interest accrues at a LIBOR-based
                  Rate or Rates,  and if interest  accrues on the ADESA Revolver
                  at more than one  LIBOR-based  Rate,  first to that portion or
                  those  portions on which  interest  accrues at a Rate or Rates
                  which  results  in  no   Prepayment   Premium  or  the  lowest
                  Prepayment Premium or Premiums.

           (iv)   Upon  three (3)  Banking  Days  notice,  ADESA may  request an
                  Advance  at a  LIBOR-based  Rate for an  appropriate  Interest
                  Period, from the Agent. As soon as possible,  and in any event
                  before the close of  business  on the next  following  Banking
                  Day, the Agent shall determine such LIBOR-based Rate and shall
                  immediately   notify  the  Banks  of  the   request   and  the
                  LIBOR-based Rate determined.  A request for a LIBOR-based Rate
                  by ADESA is  irrevocable  once made.  The Interest  Period for
                  which any  LIBOR-based  Rate is  effective  shall begin on the
                  third  Banking Day following the day on which the quotation is
                  requested.

           (v)    An  election of a  LIBOR-based  Rate and  applicable  Interest
                  Period  may be  communicated  to the  Agent on behalf of ADESA
                  only  by  an   Authorized   Officer.   Such  election  may  be
                  communicated  by telephone,  or by telephone  facsimile  (fax)
                  machine or any other form of written electronic communication,
                  or by a writing  delivered to the Agent. At the request of the
                  Agent,  ADESA shall  confirm any  election in writing and such
                  written confirmation shall be signed by an Authorized Officer.
                  The  Agent  shall be  entitled  to rely on an oral or  written
                  electronic  communication of an election of a LIBOR-based Rate
                  and Interest Period which is received by an appropriate  Agent
                  employee from anyone reasonably believed in good faith by such
                  employee to be an Authorized Officer.

           (vi)   Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this  Agreement,  the
                  Agent may elect not to quote a LIBOR-based  Rate on any day on
                  which the Agent has  determined  that it is not  practical  to
                  quote such rate because of the  unavailability  of  sufficient
                  funds   to  the   Banks   for   appropriate   terms  at  rates
                  approximating  the relevant London  Interbank  Offered Rate or
                  because  of  legal  or   regulatory   changes  which  make  it
                  impractical  or  burdensome  for the Banks to lend  money at a
                  LIBOR-based Rate.

d.      Provisions  Applicable to All of the Loans. The following provisions are
        applicable to all of the Loans:

           (i)    Calculation  of  Interest.  Interest  on the  Loans  shall  be
                  calculated  on the basis  that an entire  year's  interest  is
                  earned in 360 days,  comprised of twelve (12) thirty  (30)-day
                  months.

           (ii)   Manner of Payment - Application. All payments of principal and
                  interest  on the Loans  shall be payable at such office as the
                  Agent shall specify or at the principal office of the Agent in
                  Indianapolis, Indiana, in funds

                                      23
<PAGE>


                  available  for the Agent's  immediate  use in that city and no
                  payment will be considered to have been made until received in
                  such funds, except for payments in Canadian  dollars  required
                  under Section  2.a(vi)(A).  The Agent may debit any depository
                  account of ADESA for the payment of principal,  interest,  and
                  fees when due and payable. All payments received on account of
                  any of the Loans will be applied first to the  satisfaction of
                  any interest  which is then due and payable,  and to principal
                  only  after all  interest  which is due and  payable  has been
                  satisfied.  The Agent shall promptly disburse to the Banks all
                  payments received from ADESA.

           (iii)  Disbursement  of Advances and Agent  Reliance on Bank Funding.
                  Not later  than 1:00 p.m.  (Indianapolis  time) on the date of
                  any Advance  under the Loans,  each Bank shall make  available
                  its pro rata  portion of the  Advance in  accordance  with its
                  Commitment  in funds  immediately  available in  Indianapolis,
                  Indiana at the principal office of the Agent, or at such other
                  office as the Agent shall  specify,  except to the extent such
                  Advance  is a  reborrowing,  in  whole  or  in  part,  of  the
                  principal  amount of a  maturing  Advance,  in which case each
                  Bank  shall  record the  Advance  made by it as a part of such
                  reborrowing  on its books and  records or on a schedule to its
                  respective Notes, and shall effect the repayment,  in whole or
                  in part, as appropriate,  of its maturing  Advance through the
                  proceeds  of such  new  Advance.  The  Agent  shall  make  the
                  proceeds of each new Advance available to ADESA at the Agent's
                  principal  office in Indianapolis,  Indiana,  or at such other
                  office as the Agent shall  specify not later than the close of
                  business  on such  date.  Unless  the  Agent  shall  have been
                  notified  by a Bank prior to (or, in the case of an Advance at
                  a Prime-based Rate, by 11:00 a.m.,  Indianapolis time, on) the
                  date on which such Bank is  scheduled  to make  payment to the
                  Agent of the  proceeds of an Advance  (which  notice  shall be
                  effective upon receipt) that such Bank does not intend to make
                  such  payment,  the Agent may  assume  that such Bank has made
                  such payment when due and the Agent may in reliance  upon such
                  assumption  (but shall not be required  to) make  available to
                  ADESA the proceeds of the requested Advance to be made by such
                  Bank and, if any Bank has not in fact made such payment to the
                  Agent, such Bank shall, on demand, pay to the Agent the amount
                  made available to ADESA attributable  to such Bank together 
                  with interest  thereon in respect to each day during the
                  period  commencing  on the date such amount was made available
                  to ADESA and ending on (but excluding)  the date,  such Bank
                  pays such amount to the Agent at a rate per annum  equal to 
                  the  Prime-based  Rate.  If such amount is not received from 
                  such Bank by the Agent immediately upon  demand,  ADESA will,
                  on demand,  repay to the Agent the proceeds  of  the  Advance
                  attributable  to  such  Bank  with interest  thereon  at a
                  rate per annum  equal to the  interest rate  applicable  to
                  the  relevant  Advance,  but without such payment being 
                  considered a

                                      24
<PAGE>

                  prepayment  so  that  ADESA  will  have no  liability  for any
                  Prepayment  Premium with respect to such payment.  Neither the
                  Agent or any other Bank shall have any liability or obligation
                  to fund any other Bank's pro-rata portion of any Advance.

           (iv)   Agent Fee. In  addition  to all other fees or charges  payable
                  hereunder,  an agent fee shall be due and  payable by ADESA to
                  the Agent on the date of this Agreement in the amount of .075%
                  of  $93,000,000.  Such  agent fee shall  belong  solely to the
                  Agent as compensation for its services as Agent for the Banks.

        Section 3. THE LETTER OF CREDIT. On April 22, 1992, Bank One issued its
Letter of Credit No. S-4269-G (the "Letter of Credit") in the original amount of
$35,787,500.00  in favor of the  Trustee  and for the  account  of ADESA with an
original  expiration  date of May 6,  1995.  A copy of the  Letter  of Credit is
attached as part of Exhibit "F". Bank One hereby agree to extend the  expiration
date of the Letter of Credit to June 30, 1998,  in  accordance  with a Letter of
Extension  in the form  attached  as part of Exhibit  "F".  The Letter of Credit
secures  payment of the  Floating  Rate Notes and is subject to the terms stated
therein.  The Letter of Credit was issued  pursuant to the terms of the Original
Agreement and after the date of this Agreement shall be subject to the following
terms and  conditions,  and all other  terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement
concerning ADESA's Obligations with respect to the Letter of Credit:

a.      Reimbursement.  So long as the  Letter of Credit is  outstanding,  ADESA
        will  maintain  a demand  deposit  account  with Bank One (the  "Blocked
        Account")  through which the  transactions  described in this subsection
        will regularly be accomplished.  All amounts  deposited into the Blocked
        Account  shall  be held by Bank  One as cash  collateral  for all of the
        Obligations.  The  Blocked  Account  shall be used by ADESA only for the
        purposes  provided for in this  Agreement,  and the terms of the Blocked
        Account  shall be such  that it shall be a  "blocked"  account,  so that
        transfers of funds from the Blocked Account may be made only by Bank One
        or by ADESA with the  concurrence of the Required Banks. On the Business
        Day of each  calendar  month that is two (2) Business Days prior to each
        Floating  Rate Note Interest  Payment Date,  ADESA will deposit into the
        Blocked Account such amount as may be necessary,  after giving effect to
        the  transfer  to the Blocked  Account  from the  Sinking  Fund  Reserve
        scheduled  to occur on the same date under the terms of Section  5.f, to
        cause  the  balance  of the  Blocked  Account  to be not  less  than the
        anticipated amount of principal and interest that will be due on account
        of the  Floating  Rate  Notes at the next  Floating  Rate Note  Interest
        Payment Date,  plus the amount of the  transaction  fee (provided for in
        Section  3.b) which will be due upon Bank One's  Payment of the  related
        Drawing or  Drawings  under the  Letter of Credit.  After and only after
        honoring  a  Drawing  for the  anticipated  payment,  Bank One  shall be
        entitled, without further authorization from ADESA, to charge the amount
        of such Drawing and the related  transaction  fee to the Blocked Account
        or any other deposit  account  maintained by ADESA with Bank One. Should
        ADESA's deposit balances with Bank One be insufficient to reimburse Bank
        One for any Drawing under the Letter of Credit,

                                      25
<PAGE>


        together  with the related  transaction fee, then ADESA shall pay to the
        Agent  immediately and  unconditionally  upon demand, an amount equal to
        the  unreimbursed  portion of such  Drawing and the related  transaction
        fee,  together with interest on such amount at the Prime Rate plus three
        and one-half percent (3-1/2%) per annum from the date of payment of such
        Drawing until the amount  thereof is reimbursed to Bank One. In the case
        of any Remarketing Drawing,  ADESA shall unconditionally pay to Bank One
        on the  ninetieth  (90th)  day  following  payment  by Bank  One of such
        drawing,  or if such  ninetieth  day is not a Business  Day, then on the
        next  following  Business Day, any balance of the amount of such Drawing
        which shall not then have been  reimbursed to Bank One by the payment of
        remarketing proceeds to Bank One or otherwise, together with interest on
        such  portions of such  Remarketing  Drawing as shall not,  from time to
        time, have been reimbursed to Bank One,  accrued at the Prime-based Rate
        for Line of Credit Advances,  and with interest after such 90 day period
        accrued at the  Prime-based  Rate for Line of Credit  Advances  plus two
        percent (2%) per annum.  Upon being  reimbursed in full with interest as
        provided in this Agreement for any Remarketing  Drawing,  Bank One shall
        deliver any Pledged  Notes that were  purchased  by the Trustee with the
        proceeds  of  such  Remarketing   Drawing,  and  which  shall  not  have
        previously  been  delivered  by Bank  One upon  sale by the  Remarketing
        Agent,  to the  Trustee  for  cancellation  pursuant to the terms of the
        Trust  Indenture.  As used  in this  paragraph,  the  term  "remarketing
        proceeds"  means  proceeds  from  the  resale  of  Pledged  Notes by the
        Remarketing  Agent,  which  Pledged  Notes  shall have been  tendered or
        deemed  tendered to the Trustee for repurchase  pursuant to the terms of
        the Trust Indenture. The term "Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date"
        is used in this  subsection  as the  term  "Interest  Payment  Date"  is
        defined in the Letter of Credit. For the avoidance of doubt, it is noted
        that  notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement  including,
        without  limitation,  any provision  requiring  ADESA to give collateral
        security for ADESA'S  obligation to reimburse  Bank One for amounts paid
        on  account  of the  Letter of  Credit in  advance  of any  payment,  no
        reimbursement  obligation  on the part of ADESA shall exist with respect
        to any payment by Bank One on account of the Letter of Credit until such
        payment  shall  have been  made.  Regardless  of whether or not any cash
        collateral  is  voluntarily  pledged by ADESA or any of its  affiliates,
        Bank One shall not use any of such cash  collateral to honor draws under
        the Letter of Credit.

b.      Risk  Participation.  Each  Bank  shall  purchase  from  Bank One a risk
        participation  in the Letter of Credit  equal to its pro rata portion of
        the Maximum Available  Credit,  as set forth in Schedule A hereto.  Each
        Bank agrees to remit to Bank One, in funds  available  for immediate use
        by Bank  One in  Indianapolis,  Indiana,  its pro rata  portion  of each
        payment  made by Bank One for a  drawing  under the  Letter  of  Credit,
        promptly upon receipt of notice from Bank One of such payment.  Bank One
        agrees to  promptly  remit to each  Bank,  its pro rata  portion  of all
        applicable  fees  and  reimbursements  received  by Bank One from and on
        behalf of ADESA,  but only when and if  received  by Bank One.  Bank One
        shall be entitled to exercise its absolute  discretion in  administering
        the Letter of Credit and in  enforcing,  refraining  from  enforcing and
        determining  the manner in which it may enforce any of its rights  under
        the Letter of Credit, the Trust Indenture, the

                                      26
<PAGE>
        other  Floating Rate  Documents and this Agreement and in any collateral
        furnished pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Bank One shall not be
        required to consult with the Banks as to any such matters or to take any
        direction from any of the Banks with regard thereto.  Bank One shall not
        incur any  liability  to the Banks with  respect to any action  taken or
        omitted by bank One,  including any action taken or omitted  pursuant to
        the terms of the Trust Indenture, provided only that Bank One shall have
        acted in good  faith and with  reasonable  care.  Without  limiting  the
        generality of the foregoing,  Bank One shall be entitled to rely and act
        upon any document or communication which Bank One in good faith believes
        to be genuine and to have been  authorized by the person on whose behalf
        it is  presented  or given and which  (in the case of any  document)  is
        regular on its face.  The Banks  specifically  excuse  Bank One from any
        duty Bank One might  otherwise  have to make  further  inquiry  into the
        genuineness or due authorization of any such document or notice.

c.      Commission  and  Transaction  Fees. On October 1, 1995, and on the first
        Banking Day of each calendar  quarter  thereafter (each of which days is
        hereafter  referred to as a "Commission  Due Date").  ADESA shall pay to
        Bank One for the  benefit  of the Banks a  commission  for  issuing  and
        maintaining the Letter of Credit for the calendar  quarter in which such
        Commission  Due Date  occurs,  computed at a per annum rate equal to the
        Applicable  Letter  of  Credit  Commission  Rate  then in  effect on the
        Maximum  Available Credit which commission shall be shared pro rata with
        the Banks less a .125%  Agent fee,  and ADESA shall also pay to Bank One
        solely an administration  fee in the amount of one-eighth percent (1/8%)
        per annum of the Maximum  Available  Credit, in each case as the Maximum
        Available Credit is scheduled to increase and decrease during the period
        beginning on the  Commission  Due Date and ending on the last day of the
        calendar  quarter in which the  Commission  Due Date occurs by reason of
        anticipated  draws for  scheduled  payments of principal and interest on
        the  Floating  Rate  Notes,  and  assuming  the   reinstatement  of  the
        availability of all Interest  Drawings to the extent provided for in the
        Letter  of  Credit;   provided  that  for  purposes  of  computing  each
        commission  and  administration  fee, the amount of an Interest  Drawing
        which is subject to automatic  reinstatement  will be  considered  to be
        reinstated as of the date of such  Drawing.  There shall be no reduction
        in the amount of commission or administration fee due and payable on any
        Commission   Due  Date,   nor  shall  any   refund  of   commission   or
        administration fee be due ADESA on account of full or partial prepayment
        of the Floating Rate Notes or because of the cancellation of the Pledged
        Notes  purchased  with the proceeds of a Remarketing  Drawing during the
        quarter following the Commission Due Date as of which the amount of such
        commission or  administration  fee is  established  or on account of the
        election of Bank One not to restore  the  availability  of any  Interest
        Drawing.  The amount of the  commission and  administration  fee due and
        payable as of any  Commission  Due Date shall not be reduced,  nor shall
        any refund of the  commission  or  administration  fee be due because of
        cancellation or termination of the Letter of Credit for whatever reason,
        with the exception only that if the Letter of Credit is replaced with an
        "Alternate  Letter of Credit" (as provided  for in the Trust  Indenture)
        within six (6) months  following an increase of twenty  percent (20%) or
        more in the amount of the Letter of Credit

                                      27

        commission,  which  increase  is  imposed  by Bank One  pursuant  to the
        provisions of Section 3.d, then Bank One shall make a pro rata refund to
        ADESA of any Letter of Credit  commission which shall have been paid for
        a period  which shall not have  expired on the date the Letter of Credit
        is replaced. A transaction fee shall be payable by ADESA to Bank One for
        each Drawing  under the Letter of Credit in the amount of  one-eighth of
        one  percent  (1/8%)  of the  amount  of the  Drawing  or Sixty  Dollars
        ($60.00),  whichever is greater. Transaction fees on account of Drawings
        shall  be due on the day  when  the  Drawing  is paid by Bank  One.  All
        commissions  and fees payable  under the terms of this Section 3.c shall
        be payable with  interest at the Prime Rate plus two and  three-quarters
        percent  (2-3/4%) per annum from the date due until paid.  If the Letter
        of Credit is  transferred  to a new  beneficiary  pursuant  to the terms
        thereof, then ADESA promises to pay to Bank One promptly upon its demand
        a transfer fee in the amount then  customarily  assessed by Bank One for
        transfers of letters of credit of the same type and amount as the Letter
        of Credit. The administration fee, transaction fees and transfer fee are
        payable solely to Bank One and will not be shared with the Banks.

        d.  Additional  Amounts  Payable.  If any  change  in or the  enactment,
        adoption  or  judicial  or  administrative  interpretation  of any  law,
        regulation,   treaty,   guideline  or  directive   (including,   without
        limitation,  Regulation  D of the  Board  of  Governors  of the  Federal
        Reserve  System)  either  (i)  subjects  Bank  One or the  Banks  to any
        additional tax, duty,  charge,  deduction or withholding with respect to
        the  Letter  of  Credit  or any  amount  paid by Bank  One or the  Banks
        thereunder  or received  by Bank One or the Banks  under this  Agreement
        (other  than a tax  measured  by the net or gross  income or revenues of
        Bank One or the  Banks),  or (ii)  imposes  or  increases  any  reserve,
        special  deposit,  or  similar  requirement  on account of the Letter of
        Credit, or (iii) imposes increased minimum capital  requirements on Bank
        One or the Banks on account  of their  issuing or sharing in the risk of
        the  Letter of Credit,  and if any of the  foregoing  (w)  results in an
        increase to Bank One or the Banks in the cost of maintaining  the Letter
        of Credit or making any payment on account of the Letter of Credit,  (x)
        reduces  the amount of any payment  receivable  by Bank One or the Banks
        under this  Agreement,  (y)  requires  Bank One or the Banks to make any
        payment  calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum received
        or paid by Bank One or the  Banks  pursuant  to the  Letter of Credit or
        this  Agreement  (other than a tax  measured by Bank One's or the Banks'
        gross or net income or  revenues)  or (z)  reduces the rate of return on
        Bank One or the  Banks'  capital,  ADESA  shall  pay to Bank One and the
        Banks, as additional commission for the Letter of Credit, such amount as
        will compensate Bank One and the Banks for such increased cost,  payment
        or  reduction.  Any such payment shall be made to Bank One and the Banks
        within 15 days of demand  and  presentation  of a  certificate  to ADESA
        containing a statement of the cause of such increased  cost,  payment or
        reduction and a calculation of the amount  thereof,  which statement and
        calculation shall be deemed prima facie to be correct. For the avoidance
        of doubt, it is noted that any additional  commission  payable under the
        terms of this subsection shall be computed on the basis of the quarterly
        commission  payable on account of the Letter of Credit,  notwithstanding
        the sale of

                                      28
<PAGE>


        participations  in the risk and  funding  requirements  of the Letter of
        Credit permissible under the terms of this Agreement.

e.      Place and  Application  of  Payments --  Calculation  of  Interest.  All
        payments  required to be made under this Section 3 shall be made to Bank
        One at its principal office in Indianapolis, Indiana, in funds available
        for Bank One's  immediate  use at that city and no such  payment will be
        considered to have been made until received in such funds.  All interest
        due under any  provision  of this Section 3 shall be  calculated  on the
        basis of a year of 360 days, and on the actual number of days elapsed.

f.      Presentment and  Collection.  The Trustee and its successors as users of
        the Letter of Credit shall be deemed for  purposes of this  Agreement to
        be the  agents  of ADESA  and ADESA  assumes  all  risks of their  acts,
        omissions or misrepresentations.  Neither the Agent, the Banks, Bank One
        nor any of their affiliates or  correspondents  shall be responsible for
        the validity,  sufficiency,  truthfulness or genuineness of any document
        required to draw under the Letter of Credit even if such document should
        in  fact  prove  to be in  any or all  respects  invalid,  insufficient,
        fraudulent  or forged,  provided  only that the document  appears on its
        face to be in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Credit,  or for
        failure of any draft to bear  reference  or  adequate  reference  to the
        Letter of  Credit or  failure  of any  person to note the  amount of any
        draft on the Letter of Credit or to  surrender  or take up the Letter of
        Credit,  each of which  provisions  may be waived  by Bank  One,  or for
        errors, omissions,  interruptions, or delays in transmission or delivery
        of any messages or  documents.  Without  limiting the  generality of the
        foregoing,  any action taken by the Agent, the Banks, Bank One or any of
        their  correspondents  under or in connection with the Letter of Credit,
        if taken in good faith and with reasonable  care,  shall be binding upon
        ADESA and  shall  not put the  Agent,  the  Banks,  Bank One or any such
        correspondent  under any  resulting  liability  to ADESA and ADESA makes
        like agreement as to any omission  unless in breach of good faith.  Bank
        One is expressly  authorized  to honor any request for payment  which is
        made  under and in  compliance  with the  terms of the  Letter of Credit
        without  regard to and without any duty on its part to inquire  into the
        existence  of any  disputes  or  controversies  between  ADESA  and  the
        beneficiaries  of the  Letter of Credit  or any  other  person,  firm or
        corporation or into the respective rights,  duties or liabilities of any
        of them or whether any facts or  occurrences  represented  in any of the
        documents presented under the Letter of Credit are true and correct.

g.      Proceeds of the Floating Rate Notes. The entire proceeds of the Floating
        Rate Notes were advanced by Funding to ADESA and, ADESA represents, have
        been used by ADESA as  provided  in the  Original  Agreement  and for no
        other purposes.

h.      Cancellation  Fee.  ADESA  shall pay to the Banks a fee in the amount of
        one-half percent (1/2%) of the Maximum  Available Credit if the Floating
        Rate Notes are  prepaid by ADESA  prior to  expiration  of the Letter of
        Credit or if ADESA  replaces  the  Letter of Credit  with an  "Alternate
        Letter of Credit" as provided for in the Trust Indenture, provided that,
        in either  case,  such  cancellation  fee shall be  payable  only if the
        rating of

                                      29
<PAGE>

        Bank One's  long-term  debt by  Standard & Poor's  Corporation  is A- or
        higher at the time the Floating  Rate Notes are prepaid or the Letter of
        Credit  is  replaced.   Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this
        subsection,  no fee will be  payable on  account  of  prepayment  of the
        Floating Rate Notes or on account of replacement of the Letter of Credit
        with an Alternate  Letter of Credit if such event occurs  within six (6)
        months  following  an  increase of twenty  percent  (20%) or more in the
        amount of the Letter of Credit commission,  which increase is imposed by
        the Banks pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.d

        Section 4.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  To induce the Banks to make
the Loans, as provided for in this Agreement,  ADESA, and Funding  represent and
warrant to the Banks that:

a.      Organization  of ADESA and Funding.  ADESA and Funding are  corporations
        organized  and in  existence  under  the laws of the  State of  Indiana.
        Funding is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of ADESA. Each of the Subsidiaries
        is a  corporation  organized  and in  existence  under  the  laws of the
        respective  states or  province of  incorporation  set forth in Schedule
        4.m.  Funding  has  no  Subsidiaries.   ADESA  has  no  class  of  stock
        outstanding other than its common stock.

b.      Authorization: No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
        by ADESA and Funding,  the execution and delivery by ADESA,  Funding and
        each  Subsidiary of each of the other Credit  Documents and the Floating
        Rate Note  Documents  to which they are  respectively  parties,  and the
        performance by ADESA,  Funding and each  Subsidiary of their  respective
        obligations  under this Agreement and all of the other Credit  Documents
        and the  Floating  Rate Note  Documents  to which they are  respectively
        parties are within ADESA's,  Funding's and the  Subsidiaries'  corporate
        powers,  have been duly  authorized by all necessary  corporate  action,
        have received any required  governmental or regulatory  agency approvals
        and do not and will not contravene or conflict with any provision of law
        or of the articles of incorporation  or bylaws of any of ADESA,  Funding
        or the respective  Subsidiaries or of any agreement  binding upon any of
        ADESA,  Funding or their properties or upon the respective  Subsidiaries
        or their properties.

c.      Validity and Binding Nature.  This Agreement and all of the other Credit
        Documents and the Floating Rate Note  Documents to which ADESA,  Funding
        and the  respective  Subsidiaries  are parties are the legal,  valid and
        binding obligations of ADESA,  Funding and the respective  Subsidiaries,
        enforceable  against them in  accordance  with their  respective  terms,
        except  to  the  extent  that  enforcement  thereof  may be  limited  by
        bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,   moratorium  and  other  laws
        enacted  for the  relief of debtors  generally  and other  similar  laws
        affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable
        principles which may affect the availability of specific performance and
        other equitable remedies.

                                      30

d.      Financial  Statements.  ADESA has  delivered  to the  Agent its  audited
        financial  statement as of December 31, 1994, and its unaudited  interim
        financial statements as of June 30, 1995, and for the fiscal quarter and
        partial fiscal year then ended.  Such  statements  have been prepared in
        accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  consistently
        applied except,  as to the June 30, 1995 statements,  for the absence of
        footnotes  and  adjustments  normally  made at year  end  which  are not
        material  in  amount.  Such  statements  present  fairly  the  financial
        position  of  ADESA  as of the  dates  thereof  and the  results  of its
        operations and cash flows for the periods  covered and since the date of
        such  statements  there  has  been no  material  adverse  change  in the
        financial  position  of ADESA or in the  results  of its  operations  or
        operating  cash flows. 

e.      Litigation  and  Contingent  Liabilities.  No  litigation,   arbitration
        proceedings or governmental  proceedings are pending or, to ADESA's best
        knowledge,   are  threatened  against  ADESA,  Funding  or  any  of  the
        Subsidiaries  which  would,  if  adversely  determined,  materially  and
        adversely  affect the  financial  position or  continued  operations  of
        ADESA,  Funding or any of the Subsidiaries.  None of ADESA,  Funding nor
        any Subsidiary has any material contingent  liabilities not provided for
        or disclosed in the financial  statements  referred to in Section 4.d or
        in the "Schedule of Exceptions" attached as Schedule 4.e.

f.      Liens.  None of the  assets  of ADESA,  Funding  or any  Subsidiary  are
        subject to any mortgage,  pledge,  title  retention  lien or other lien,
        encumbrance or security interest except for liens and security interests
        described in the exceptions enumerated in Section 7.b

g.      Employee  Benefit Plans.  Each Plan maintained by ADESA or by any of the
        Subsidiaries  is in material  compliance  with ERISA,  the Code, and all
        applicable  rules and  regulations  adopted  by  regulatory  authorities
        pursuant  thereto,  and ADESA and all of the Subsidiaries have filed all
        reports  and returns  required  to be filed by ERISA,  the Code and such
        rules and  regulations,  except for such omissions,  the consequences of
        which would be inconsequential. No Plan maintained by ADESA or by any of
        the  Subsidiaries  and no trust created under any such Plan has incurred
        any "accumulated funding deficiency" as defined in Section 302 of ERISA,
        and the present  value of all  benefits  vested  under each Plan did not
        exceed, as of the last annual valuation date, the value of the assets of
        the respective Plans allocable to such vested benefits. Neither ADESA
        nor any Subsidiary has any knowledge that any "reportable  event" as
        defined in ERISA has occurred with respect to any Plan.

h.      Payment of Taxes. ADESA,  Funding and all of the Subsidiaries have filed
        all federal,  state and local tax returns and tax related  reports which
        any of them is  required to file by any  statute or  regulation  and all
        taxes and any tax related  interest  payments and penalties that are due
        and payable have been paid,  except for taxes which are being  contested
        in good  faith and by  appropriate  proceedings  and for the  payment of
        which appropriate  reserves have been provided.  Adequate  provision has
        been made for the  payment  when due of all tax  liabilities  which have
        been incurred, but are not as yet due and payable.

                                      31

i.      Investment Company Act. None of ADESA,  Funding nor any Subsidiary is an
        "investment  company"  or  a  company  "controlled"  by  an  "investment
        company"  within the meaning of the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as
        amended.

j.      Regulation  U. None of ADESA,  Funding  nor any  Subsidiary  is  engaged
        principally,  or as one of its important activities,  in the business of
        extending  credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock
        within the  meaning of  Regulation  U of the Board of  Governors  of the
        Federal Reserve System.  Not more than twenty-five  percent (25%) of the
        consolidated  assets of  ADESA,  Funding  or of any of the  Subsidiaries
        consists of margin stock.

k.      Hazardous   Substances.   Except  as  disclosed  on  the   "Schedule  of
        Exceptions"  attached as Schedule  4.e, to the best  knowledge  of ADESA
        after due inquiry and  investigation,  there are no underground  storage
        tanks of any kind on any premises owned or occupied by or under lease to
        ADESA  or  any  Subsidiary  and  there  are no  tanks,  drums  or  other
        containers  of any kind on premises  owned or occupied by or under lease
        to ADESA or any  Subsidiary,  the contents of which are unknown to ADESA
        or the Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed on the "Schedule of Exceptions"
        attached  as Schedule  4.e.,  to the best  knowledge  of ADESA after due
        inquiry and  investigation,  no  premises  owned or occupied by or under
        lease to ADESA or any Subsidiary have ever been used, and as of the date
        of this  Agreement,  no such premises are being used for any  activities
        involving the use,  treatment,  transportation,  generation,  storage or
        disposal of any Hazardous  Substances in  reportable  quantities  and no
        Hazardous Substances in reportable  quantities have been released on any
        such  premises  nor is there any  threat  of  release  of any  Hazardous
        Substances in reportable quantities on any such premises.

l.      Other  Representations.  ADESA, Funding and each Subsidiary is qualified
        to do business  in every  jurisdiction  in which:  (i) the nature of the
        business  conducted or the character or location of properties  owned or
        leased by ADESA and  Subsidiaries,  or the  residences  or activities of
        employees  of  ADESA  and  the  Subsidiaries  make  such   qualification
        necessary,   and  (ii)  failure  so  to  qualify  could   reasonably  be
        anticipated  to impair the title of ADESA and  Subsidiaries  to material
        properties or the right of ADESA or any  Subsidiary to enforce  material
        contracts or result in exposure of ADESA and  Subsidiaries  to liability
        for material  penalties in such  jurisdiction.  No jurisdiction in which
        ADESA or any  Subsidiary  is not  qualified  to do business has asserted
        that ADESA or any  Subsidiary is required to be qualified  therein.  The
        principal   office  of  ADESA  is  located  at  1919  South  Post  Road,
        Indianapolis, Indiana. ADESA does not conduct any material operations or
        keep any material amounts of property at any other location. Funding was
        incorporated  on February 6, 1992,  and since its  incorporation  it has
        conducted no operations  and has engaged in no  transactions  other than
        those  necessarily  involved in the issuance of the Floating Rate Notes.

        Section 5.  COLLATERAL  FOR THE  OBLIGATIONS.  The  Obligations  will be
secured as provided in this Section.

a.      The ADESA Security  Agreement.  The Obligations are and will continue to
        be secured by a security interest in all equipment,  inventory, accounts
        receivable  and  general  intangibles  of ADESA now  owned or  hereafter
        acquired  and in the  proceeds  thereof,  which  security  interest  was
        created and will  continue to exist by virtue of the Security  Agreement
        dated April 22, 1992,  executed by ADESA in favor of the Agent  pursuant
        to the  requirements  of the  Original  Agreement  (the "ADESA  Security
        Agreement").  ADESA shall execute the Amendment to Collateral  Documents
        in the form of Exhibit  "G"  attached  hereto to add all of the Banks as
        secured  parties  under  the  ADESA  Security  Agreement.  The  Security
        Agreement  provides  a security  interest  in the  collateral  described
        therein  subject only to liens and security  interests  described in the
        exceptions  enumerated in Section 7.b. The Agent acknowledges that as an
        incident to the execution of the Original  Agreement,  ADESA provided to
        the Agent appraisal reports with respect to the forced liquidation value
        of  substantially  all of the  equipment  then  owned by  ADESA  and the
        Subsidiaries.  ADESA  shall  provide  to the  Banks at  ADESA's  expense
        appraisal  reports,  addressed to the Banks,  of the forced  liquidation
        value of any equipment  subsequently  or hereafter  acquired by ADESA or
        any of  the  Subsidiaries,  which  acquisitions  individually  or in the
        aggregate  are  material to the  consolidated  financial  statements  of
        ADESA.  Upon the Banks'  request,  ADESA  shall  furnish to the Banks at
        ADESA's expense  currently  dated appraisal  reports with respect to the
        forced   liquidation  value  of  all  of  the  equipment  shown  in  the
        consolidated  financial  statements  of ADESA  from  time to time as the
        Banks  may  reasonably  require,  but not more  than once in any two (2)
        consecutive fiscal years of ADESA.

b.      Guaranties.  The Obligations  will further be supported by unconditional
        guaranties of prompt  payment of Funding,  and each of the  Subsidiaries
        excluding AFC, which guaranties are evidenced by the Guaranty Agreements
        executed by Funding and such  Subsidiaries  pursuant to the requirements
        of the Original Agreement. Funding and each Subsidiary shall execute the

d.      Subsidiary  Security  Agreements -- Subsidiary  Pledge  Agreements.  The
        obligations  of Funding,  and each of the  Subsidiaries,  excluding AFC,
        under  their  respective  Guaranty  Agreements  shall  be  secured  by a
        security  interest  in  all  of  the  equipment,   inventory,   accounts
        receivable   and  general   intangibles  of  Funding  and  each  of  the
        Subsidiaries, now owned or hereafter acquired, and the proceeds thereof,
        which security interests were created and will continue by virtue of the
        Security Agreements  executed by Funding and such Subsidiaries  pursuant
        to the requirements of the Original Agreement (the "Subsidiary  Security
        Agreements"). Funding and each Subsidiary shall execute the Amendment to
        Collateral  Documents  in the form of  Exhibit  "G" to add the  Banks as
        Secured Parties. In the case of any other subsidiary hereafter formed or
        acquired by ADESA,  including but no limited to ADESA New Jersey,  Inc.,
        Auto  Banc  Corporations  and ADESA  Remarketing  Services,  Inc.,  such
        security interest will be created by a Security Agreement  substantially
        in the form of Exhibit  "I". The  Subsidiary  Security  Agreements  will
        provide a security interest in the collateral described therein, subject
        only  to  liens  and  security  interests  described  in the  exceptions
        enumerated in Section 7.b. The obligations of A.D.E.  Management Company

        The Obligations of ADESA Indianapolis, Inc. under its Guaranty Agreement
        are and shall continue to be secured by pledge of 5 shares of the common
        stock of ADESA Auto Transport, Inc. Such pledges are evidenced by Pledge
        Agreements (the  "Subsidiary  Pledge  Agreements")  each dated April 22,
        1992,  which  Subsidiary  Pledge  Agreements were executed and delivered
        pursuant  to  the   requirements   of  the  Original   Agreement.   Such
        Subsidiaries  shall  execute  the  Amendment  to  Collateral   Agreement
        attached  as  Exhibit  "G" to add the  Banks  as  parties  thereto.  The
        obligations of ADESA Canada,  Inc.,  under its Guaranty shall be secured

        Agreement  dated August 16, 1993,  as amended and restated by an Amended
        and Restated

        Pledge  Agreement dated June 30, 1994.  ADESA-Ottawa,  Inc. shall secure
        its  Guaranty by a pledge of all of the shares of common  stock of ADESA
        Remarketing Services, Inc. pursuant to a Pledge Agreement in the form of
        Exhibit "O" attached hereto.

e.      Pledged Notes. In addition to all other  collateral for the Obligations,
        the Obligation are and shall continue to be further  secured by a pledge
        of and a security interest in any Floating Rate Notes purchased with the
        proceeds of any Remarketing Drawing (the "Pledged Notes"),  which pledge
        and security  interest  Funding  hereby grants to the Banks.  As soon as
        possible following any Remarketing  Drawing, and in any event within ten
        (10) days of the date of such Drawing, Funding will cause the Trustee to
        deliver the Pledged Notes related to that Drawing to the Agent,  for the
        benefit of the Banks,  which  Pledged  Notes shall be  registered in the
        name of the  Agent,  for the  benefit  of the  Banks,  or in the name of
        Funding and  accompanied  by  appropriate  endorsements  or  assignments
        executed on behalf of Funding in blank, with the signatures  guaranteed.
        If any of the Pledged Notes are in the custody of or are registered to a
        Clearing  Corporation  or  other  Financial   Intermediary,   then  this
        Agreement  will  in and  of  itself  constitute  an  Instruction  to the
        Clearing  Corporation or other  Financial  Intermediary  to transfer the
        Pledged Notes from the account of Funding to the account of the Agent on
        the books of the Clearing  Corporation or other Financial  Intermediary.
        During the period in which any  Floating  Rate Notes are Pledged  Notes,
        the Banks  shall be  entitled  to receive  and retain  all  payments  of
        principal and interest on account of the Pledged Notes and such payments
        shall be  applied by the Banks to  satisfaction  of  Obligations  in the
        order provided below. If Funding should receive any payment of principal
        or interest on account of any Pledged Notes,  Funding shall receive such
        amounts  in trust for the  Banks  and  subject  to the  Banks'  security
        interest,  and shall immediately  forward any such payment to the Agent,
        for the  benefit of the Banks in the form in which  received by Funding,
        adding only such  assignments  or  endorsements  as may be  necessary to
        perfect the Agent's title thereto.  Funding appoints and constitutes the
        Agent  as  its  agent  and  any  officer  of  the  Agent  as   Funding's
        attorney-in-fact   for  purposes  of:  (i)  executing   instruments   of
        assignment  or  endorsement  of any  Pledged  Notes;  (ii)  issuing  any
        Instruction  or taking any other  action  necessary to cause any Pledged
        Notes to be  transferred  on the books of any  Clearing  Corporation  or
        other Financial  Intermediary from the account of Funding to the Agent's
        account or to cause the Pledged  Notes to be  registered  in the Agent's
        name on the books and records of any  Registrar  for the  Floating  Rate
        Notes,  and (iii) taking any other action  necessary to cause the Banks'
        security  interest to be perfected or to facilitate  any transfer of the
        Pledged Notes deemed necessary or desirable by the Required Banks.  Such
        appointment  and such  power are  irrevocable  so long as the  Letter of
        Credit is outstanding or any Obligations remain unsatisfied.  Should any
        Pledged Notes be sold by the Remarketing  Agent pursuant to the terms of
        the Trust Indenture,  the Agent will deliver such Pledged Notes together
        with appropriate  instruments of assignment to or in accordance with the
        instructions of the Remarketing Agent against payment of the proceeds of
        such  sale,  which  proceeds  shall  then be applied by the Agent to the
        satisfaction  of  Obligations in the order  provided  below.  Should any
        Pledged  Notes not be sold by the  Remarketing  Agent on or  before  the
        ninetieth day following the related

                                      36
<PAGE>

        Remarketing  Drawing, or on or before the next following Business Day if
        such  ninetieth  day is not a Business Day, then the Agent shall deliver
        the  Pledged  Notes to the  Trustee for  cancellation.  Any  payments of
        principal  or interest on account of Pledged  Notes and any  proceeds of
        Pledged Notes sold by the Remarketing  Agent received by the Agent shall
        be  applied  by  the  Agent  first  to  satisfy  ADESA's   reimbursement
        obligation with respect to the Remarketing Drawing the proceeds of which
        were used to purchase the related Pledged Notes, next to the transaction
        fee related to such Remarketing  Drawing,  and then to such other of the
        Obligations as may then be  outstanding,  as the Required Banks in their
        discretion shall choose.  If no Obligations are then due and payable and
        if no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is
        continuing,  the Agent shall pay any remaining  portion of such funds to
        ADESA.  ADESA may use such funds for any purpose  permissible  under the
        terms of this Agreement. As used in this paragraph,  the terms "Clearing
        Corporation,"  "Instruction"  and "Financial  Intermediary"  are used as
        defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in Indiana.

f.      Sinking  Fund  Reserve.   In  addition  to  the  Investment   Account  B
        established  by ADESA with the Trust Group of the Agent  pursuant to the
        requirements of Section 6.i, ADESA has established  with the Trust Group
        of the Agent,  an investment  agency  account  ("Investment  Account A")
        under  the  Agent's  usual  and  customary  form of  agreement  for such
        accounts.  ADESA shall pay the Agent's usual and  customary  charges for
        services  rendered by the Agent's  Trust Group in  connection  with such
        account for the Agent's sole  benefit.  All of the assets of  Investment
        Account A are and shall  continue  to be  pledged to the Banks to secure
        the  Obligations on the terms  expressed in the pledge  agreement  dated
        April 22, 1992, (the "Pledge  Agreement")  executed by ADESA in favor of
        the Agent  pursuant to the terms of the  Original  Agreement,  and shall
        constitute a fund (the "Sinking Fund Reserve") in order to assure timely
        reimbursement to the Agent of all principal drawings under the Letter of
        Credit.  ADESA shall execute  Amendment to  Collateral  Documents in the
        form of Exhibit "G" to add the Banks as secured parties under the Pledge
        Agreement.  Investments  of  Investment  Account A shall be  limited  to
        Qualified Investments, provided that no certificate of deposit purchased
        as an asset of  Investment  Account A shall have a maturity  date beyond
        the  nearer  of the  first  Business  Day of  March  or  September  next
        following and no specific  security  purchased as an asset of Investment
        Account A shall  have a maturity  more than six months  from the date of
        purchase.  So long as any of the  Floating  Rate Notes are  outstanding,
        ADESA shall make such  deposits to the  Sinking  Fund  Reserve as may be
        necessary  to cause the balance of the Sinking Fund Reserve on the first
        Business Day of each May, June, July,  August and September of each year
        to be not less than 1/6,  1/3,  1/2, 2/3 and 5/6,  respectively,  of the
        amount of the mandatory  Sinking Fund  redemption of Floating Rate Notes
        required  to be made on the  following  October  1 under  the  terms  of
        Section 3.02 of the Trust Indenture. So long as any of the Floating Rate
        Notes are  outstanding,  ADESA  shall make such  deposits to the Sinking
        Fund  Reserve as may be  necessary  to cause the  balance of the Sinking
        Fund  Reserve  on the first  Business  Day of each  November,  December,
        January,  February and March of each year to be not less than 1/6,  1/3,
        1/2, 2/3 and 5/6,  respectively,  of the amount of the mandatory Sinking
        Fund redemption of Floating Rate

                                      37
<PAGE>

        Notes  required to be made on the  following  April 1 under the terms of
        Section  3.02 of the Trust  Indenture.  The Agent shall give  continuing
        instructions  to its Trust Group to transfer  the entire net  realizable
        cash value of the  Account of the  Sinking  Fund  Reserve to the Blocked
        Account  on the  Business  Day which is two  Business  Days prior to the
        first Business Day of each March and September. As used in the preceding
        sentence,  the phrase "net  realizable  cash value of the Account" means
        the amount of the  Account  which then  consists of or can be reduced to
        cash,  less charges of the Agent's Trust Group due and payable under the
        terms of Investment  Account A. Such instructions shall remain in effect
        until an Event of Default  shall have  occurred  and is  continuing,  at
        which time the Banks may deal with the Sinking  Fund Reserve as with any
        other collateral for the Obligations.

g.      Pledge of Investment  Account B. The  Obligations are and shall continue
        to be further  secured by a pledge of and a security  interest in all of
        the  cash and  securities  held in  Investment  Account  B  (established
        pursuant to the  requirements  of Section 6.i) and the proceeds  thereof
        which pledge and security  interest  shall be on the terms  expressed in
        the Pledge Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the pledge of Investment Account
        B, ADESA shall be free to withdraw assets from Investment  Account B and
        use them for any proper corporate purpose consistent with the provisions
        of this Agreement until such time as an Event of Default or an Unmatured
        Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Required  Banks,
        during the  continuance  of such Event of Default or Unmatured  Event of
        Default, shall have notified the Agent's Trust Group that (i) no further
        withdrawal of assets from Investment Account B nor changes in the assets
        held in  Investment  Account B may be made  without  the  consent of the
        Required Banks and (ii) the Agent shall  thereafter  otherwise  exercise
        control over Investment  Account B as provided in the Pledge  Agreement.
        After the  Required  Banks  through the Agent shall have given notice to
        the Agent's Trust Group as provided in the preceding sentence, the Agent
        shall continue to exercise control over Investment Account B for so long
        as the  Required  Banks in their  discretion  deems it prudent to do so,
        notwithstanding the fact that all Events of Default and Unmatured Events
        of  Default  which  existed  at the time such  notice was given or which
        occurred thereafter shall have been cured. Investment Account B shall be
        a  segregated  account,  separate  from the  investment  agency  account
        established  by ADESA with the Trust Group of the Agent  pursuant to the
        requirements of Section 5.f.

h.      Pledge of Stock of Funding and the Subsidiaries. The Obligations are and
        shall  continue to be further  secured by a pledge,  evidenced by and on
        the terms and conditions  expressed in the Pledge  Agreement,  of all of
        the shares of each class of equity securities of Funding and each of the
        Subsidiaries  owned by ADESA.  ADESA  shall  execute  the  Amendment  to
        Collateral  Documents  in the form of  Exhibit  "G" to add the  Banks as
        parties thereto.  ADESA shall further execute and deliver to the Agent a
        new Schedule to Pledge Agreement in the form of Exhibit "J", listing all
        Subsidiaries  owned by ADESA  as of the  date of this  Agreement.  ADESA
        shall  deliver or shall  have  delivered  to the Agent the  certificates
        representing all of the shares of, or ownership interest in, any

                                      38
<PAGE>

        Subsidiary  created  or  acquired  after  the  date of  this  Agreement,
        together with an amendment to the Schedule to Pledge Agreement.

i.      Pledge of Inter-Company  Notes,  Inter-Company  Security  Agreements and
        Inter-Company  Mortgages. The obligations of each of the Subsidiaries to
        ADESA on account of any loans or  advances  made at any time by ADESA to
        the Subsidiary  shall be evidenced by a promissory  note executed by the
        Subsidiary  in  favor  of ADESA  in the  form of  Exhibit  "K"  (each an
        "Inter-Company  Note").  All of the  obligations  of each  Subsidiary to
        ADESA  represented  by an  Inter-Company  Note  executed by a Subsidiary
        which is the owner of one of the Parcels  subject to a Mortgage (each of
        which  Subsidiary  is  hereafter  referred  to in this  Subsection  as a
        "Mortgagor  Subsidiary") shall be secured by mortgage liens and security
        interests  created by mortgages or deeds of trust (each a "Inter-Company
        Mortgage" and collectively,  the "Inter-Company Mortgages"). In the case
        of the  Parcels  owned  by  each  of the  Mortgagor  Subsidiaries,  such
        mortgage liens and security interests were created and shall continue to
        exist by virtue of the  mortgages  and  deeds of trust  executed  by the
        Mortgagor  Subsidiaries  pursuant to the  requirements  of the  Original
        Agreement. Each of the Inter-Company Mortgages was collaterally assigned
        by ADESA to the  Agent,  for the  benefit  of the  Banks,  to secure the
        Obligations  by  Collateral   Assignments   executed   pursuant  to  the
        requirements of the Original  Agreement.  ADESA shall execute amendments
        to the Collateral  Assignments to add the Banks as parties thereto.  All
        of the  obligations  of  each  Subsidiary  to  ADESA  represented  by an
        Inter-Company  Note shall be further  secured by a security  interest in
        all  of  the  equipment,  inventory,  accounts  receivable  and  general
        intangibles of the Subsidiary,  now owned or hereafter acquired, and the
        proceeds thereof, which security interest shall be created by a security
        agreement (each an "Inter-Company Security Agreement" and, collectively,
        the  "Inter-Company  Security  Agreements").  In the case of each of the
        Subsidiaries, such security interests were created and shall continue to
        exist by virtue of the Inter-Company  Security  Agreements,  executed by
        the respective Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of the Original
        Agreement.  In the case of any  other  Subsidiary  hereafter  formed  or
        acquired by ADESA,  including but not limited to ADESA New Jersey, Inc.,
        Auto  Banc  Corporation  and  ADESA  Remarketing  Services,  Inc.,  such
        security interest shall be created by a security agreement substantially
        in the Form of Exhibit "L". The Inter-Company  Security  Agreements will
        provide a security interest in the collateral described therein which is
        second and inferior to the security  interests created by the Subsidiary
        Security  Agreements,  but otherwise,  subject only to those other liens
        and security interests described in the exceptions enumerated in Section
        7.b. All of the Obligations are and shall continue to be further secured
        by a pledge and collateral assignment of each of the Inter-Company Notes
        and each of the  Inter-Company  Security  Agreements,  which  pledge and
        collateral  assignment  shall be  evidenced by and shall be on the terms
        and conditions  expressed in the Pledge  Agreement.  The  obligations of
        A.D.E.  Management Company  ("Management")  under its Inter-Company Note
        are and shall  continue to be further  secured by a pledge of 100 shares
        of the common stock of A.D.E. of Jacksonville,  Inc., which pledge shall
        provide a security  interest in such stock which is second and  inferior
        to the security interest of the Banks created by the

                                      39

        Subsidiary Pledge Agreement executed by Management.  The pledge in favor
        of ADESA to secure Management's Inter-Company Note is and shall continue
        to be  evidenced by the  Inter-Company  Security  Agreement  executed by
        Management  and is and shall  continue  to be  perfected  by the Agent's
        holding  the  Note  as  collateral   agent  for  ADESA  as  provided  in
        Management's  Subsidiary  Pledge  Agreement.  The  obligations  of ADESA
        Indianapolis, Inc. under its Inter-Company Note is and shall continue to
        be further  secured by a pledge of 5 shares of the common stock of ADESA
        Auto Transport,  Inc., which pledge shall provide a security interest in
        such stock which is second and inferior to the security  interest of the
        Banks  created by the  Subsidiary  Pledge  Agreement  executed  by ADESA
        Indianapolis,  Inc.  The  pledge  in  favor of  ADESA  to  secure  ADESA
        Indianapolis,  Inc.'s  Inter-Company  Note is and shall  continue  to be
        evidenced  by the  Inter-Company  Security  Agreement  executed by ADESA
        Indianapolis,  Inc.  and is and shall  continue to be  perfected  by the
        Agent's  holding the Note as  collateral  agent for ADESA as provided in
        ADESA Indianapolis, Inc.'s Subsidiary Pledge Agreement. The Subsidiaries
        shall  execute the  Amendment  to  Collateral  Documents  in the form of
        Exhibit "G" to add the Banks as parties thereto.

j.      Agent as Collateral  Agent for Banks.  All collateral  from time to time
        securing  the  Obligations  shall exist for the  ratable  benefit of the
        Banks.  The  interest of each Bank in the  collateral  from time to time
        existing  shall  be pro  rata  according  to  the  proportion  that  its
        Commitment  bears to all  Commitments of the Banks,  but the interest of
        each Bank in the  collateral  shall rank  equally in  priority  with the
        interest of each other Bank.  Notwithstanding  the time, order or method
        of  attachment  or  perfection  of any  security  interest or lien,  and
        notwithstanding  anything  contained in any filing or agreement to which
        any of the Banks is a party,  any lien or security  interest in favor of
        any of the  Banks  in any of  the  collateral  described  in the  Credit
        Documents which arises out of any prior or subsequent  transaction shall
        be  subordinate to the security  interest or lien in such  collateral in
        favor of the Banks under the Credit Documents. The Banks acknowledge and
        agree  that the Agent  shall  serve as  collateral  agent for all of the
        Banks  and  that  any  filing,  mortgage,  security  agreement  or other
        instrument  perfecting or evidencing a lien or security  interest in the
        collateral  in the  name of the  Agent  shall  be  deemed  to be for the
        benefit of all of the Banks in accordance with this  Agreement.  Subject
        to the further  provisions of this Agreement,  and subject to the advice
        of its  counsel,  the Agent  shall act with  respect  to the  collateral
        securing the Obligations under the Credit Documents as instructed by the
        Required  Banks.  No Bank will take any action to enforce  its  rights,
        pursue any remedy or foreclose any liens against  ADESA,  Funding or any
        Subsidiary (other than by way of set-off), except through the Agent.

k.      Adjustments to Collateral. If any Bank (a "Benefited Bank") shall at any
        time  receive  any  payment  of  all  or any  part  of  the  Obligations
        hereunder,  or interest  thereon,  or receive any  collateral in respect
        thereof  (whether by set-off or otherwise) in a greater  proportion than
        its ratable  portion,  such  Benefited Bank shall purchase for cash from
        the other Banks such portion of the other Banks' Notes, or shall provide
        such  other  Banks  with the  benefits  of any such  collateral,  or the
        proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to

                                      40
<PAGE>


        cause the Benefited Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such
        collateral or proceeds ratably with the other Banks; provided,  however,
        that if all or any  portion  of  such  excess  payment  or  benefits  is
        thereafter  recovered  from the Benefited  Bank,  such purchase shall be
        rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned to the extent of
        such recovery,  but without interest.  ADESA and Funding agree that each
        Bank so  purchasing  a portion of another  Bank's Notes may exercise all
        rights of payment  (including,  without  limitation,  rights of set-off)
        with  respect  to such  portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct
        holder of such  portion.  If during any period of an Unmatured  Event of
        Default or Event of Default,  a Benefited Bank receives payment or other
        proceeds in connection  with any other credit facility with ADESA or any
        Subsidiary,  excluding  AFC,  such payment or proceeds  shall be applied
        exclusively for the pro rata benefit of the Banks in connection with the
        Obligations  hereunder  prior to any  application  to such other  credit
        facility.

        Section 6.  AFFIRMATIVE  COVENANTS.  Until all  Obligations  of ADESA or
Funding  terminate  or are  paid  and  satisfied  in  full,  and so  long as any
Commitment or the Letter of Credit is outstanding,  ADESA and Funding agree that
each will strictly observe each of the following covenants applicable to it, and
ADESA  agrees  that it will  cause  Funding  to  observe  each of the  following
covenants  applicable  to Funding,  unless at any time the Required  Banks shall
otherwise expressly consent in writing,  which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed:

        corporate existences and ADESA shall preserve the corporate existence of
        each Subsidiary.

                  with the audit  report,  unqualified  as to scope,  of Ernst &
                  Young.  Each  such  set  of  financial   statements  shall  be

                  financial officer of ADESA that such financial statements have

        attached as Schedule 4.e., ADESA shall  immediately  notify the Agent of
        the  commencement  of such activity with respect to each such  Hazardous
        Substance.  ADESA shall cause any Hazardous  Substances which are now or
        may hereafter be used or generated in the  operations of ADESA,  Funding
        or any  Subsidiary  in  reportable  quantities  to be accounted  for and
        disposed of in compliance with all applicable federal,

                                      45

        state,  Canadian,  Canadian  provincial and local laws and  regulations.
        ADESA shall notify the Agent immediately upon obtaining knowledge that:

           (i)    any premises which have at any time been owned and occupied by
                  or have been under lease to ADESA,  Funding or any  Subsidiary
                  are  the  subject  of an  environmental  investigation  by any
                  federal,   state,  Canadian,   Canadian  provincial  or  local
                  governmental agency having jurisdiction over the regulation of
                  any Hazardous  Substances,  the purpose of which investigation
                  is to quantify the levels of the Hazardous  Substances located
                  on such premises, or

           (ii)   ADESA,  Funding  or  any  Subsidiary  has  been  named  or  is
                  threatened to be named as a party responsible for the possible
                  contamination  of any  real  property  or  ground  water  with
                  Hazardous  Substances,  including,  but  not  limited  to  the
                  contamination of past and present waste disposal sites.

        If ADESA,  Funding or any Subsidiary is notified of any event  described
        at items (i) or (ii) above, ADESA shall immediately engage or cause such
        Subsidiary  to  engage  a firm or firms of  engineers  or  environmental
        consultants appropriately qualified to determine as quickly as practical
        the extent of  contamination  and the potential  financial  liability of
        ADESA,  Funding or any Subsidiary  with respect  thereto,  and the Agent
        shall be provided with a copy of any report  prepared by such firm or by
        any  governmental  agency as to such  matters as soon as any such report
        becomes   available  to  ADESA.   The  selection  of  any  engineers  or
        environmental  consultants  engaged pursuant to the requirements of this
        Section  shall be subject to the approval of the Agent,  which  approval
        shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Notwithstanding any other provision
        of this subsection,  if ADESA,  Funding or any Subsidiary is notified of
        any event described at items (i) or (ii) above,  and if ADESA determines
        that the course of action  outlined above should not be required in view
        of the  manifest  magnitude  of the  problem,  or would not be a prudent
        course of action  for ADESA to pursue in view of all the  circumstances,
        ADESA  shall  immediately  notify  the  Agent  of that  fact  and of the
        alternate  course of  action  which  ADESA  proposes  to pursue  and the
        Required  Banks shall not  unreasonably  withhold their approval of such
        alternate course of action.

l.      Sinking Fund Reserve Payments.  ADESA shall make deposits to the Sinking
        Fund Reserve in a timely  manner as required  under the terms of Section
        5.f.

m.      Obligations  Under the Floating Rate Note  Documents.  ADESA and Funding
        will  pay  and  perform  in a  timely  manner  all of  their  respective
        obligations  under those  Floating Rate Note Documents to which they are
        respectively parties.

        Section 7. NEGATIVE  COVENANTS OF ADESA.  Until all Obligations of ADESA
or Funding  terminate or are paid and  satisfied in full,  and so long as either
the Commitment or the Letter of Credit is  outstanding,  ADESA and Funding agree
that each will strictly observe each of

                                      46
<PAGE>

           (v)    easements,  licenses,  minor  irregularities in title or minor
                  encumbrances on or over any real property which do not, in the
                  judgment of the Agent,  materially  detract  from the value of
                  such property or its  marketability  or its  usefulness in the
                  business of ADESA, Funding or any Subsidiary;

           (vi)   liens for taxes and governmental charges which are not yet due
                  or which are being  contested in good faith and by appropriate

                  established;

                  permissible  under the limitation on indebtedness  incurred to
                  persons other than the Banks expressed in Section 7.k;

           (ix)   those specific  liens now existing  described on the "Schedule

        to create,  assume or suffer any liens (as defined in Section 7.b above)
        on any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired.

d.      Guaranties,  Loans or Advances. ADESA shall not be a guarantor or surety

                                      48
<PAGE>


        Exceptions"  attached as Schedule  4.e.,  (ii)  extensions  of credit or

        merger.  Neither ADESA nor Funding shall  purchase,  and ADESA shall not
        permit any  Subsidiary  to purchase  the capital  stock of or  otherwise

        acquire any  material  part of the assets of any other  business  entity
        other than in the ordinary course of business. Neither ADESA nor Funding
        shall sell,  transfer,  convey or lease,  and ADESA shall not permit any
        Subsidiary to sell,  transfer,  convey or lease all or any material part
        of its assets,  except inventory in the ordinary course of business,  or
        sell or assign with or without recourse any receivables. ADESA shall not
        cause to be created or otherwise  acquire any  additional  Subsidiaries,
        except for the creation of Subsidiaries for purposes of reorganizing the
        business being conducted by ADESA and the Subsidiaries prior to the time
        such new Subsidiary is created.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of
        this Section,  ADESA may, without the prior written consent of any Bank,
        effect  a  start-up  or  acquire   directly  or  indirectly   through  a
        Subsidiary,  all of the  capital  stock or other  equity  interest  in a
        corporation or other business  entity,  or acquire all or  substantially
        all of the business assets of any such entity,  either by purchase or by
        merger,  provided  that either  ADESA or a Subsidiary  is the  surviving
        corporation in the case of any merger,  and provided further that in the
        case of any such acquisition or start-up all of the following conditions
        are fulfilled: (i) the cost to ADESA, considered on a consolidated basis
        (excluding  AFC), of any one start-up or  acquisition  consummated  in a
        fiscal year does not exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (excluding
        costs of the  Jacksonville,  Florida and Manville,  New Jersey  auctions
        presently  being  developed),  (ii) the cost to ADESA,  considered  on a
        consolidated   basis   (excluding   AFC),  of  all  such  start-ups  and
        acquisitions  consummated  in any  fiscal  year does not  exceed  Twelve
        Million Dollars  ($12,000,000.00)  (excluding costs of the Jacksonville,
        Florida and Manville, New Jersey auctions presently being

                                      49
<PAGE>


        developed);  and (iii) no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
        exists at the time of any such  start-up or  acquisition  or occurs as a
        result  thereof.  The cost of any  acquisition or start-up shall include
        the present value of future lease  payments.  As used in this paragraph,
        the term  "start-up"  means the acquisition of assets and the payment of
        other  initial  expenses  necessary  to  commence  operation  of an auto
        auction at a location  other than a location at which such an  operation
        is conducted by ADESA or any Subsidiary prior to such acquisition.

f.      Margin  Stock.  Neither  ADESA nor  Funding  shall use,  nor shall ADESA
        permit  any  Subsidiary  to use or cause or permit the  proceeds  of the
        Loans  or the  Floating  Rate  Notes  to be  used,  either  directly  or
        indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate,  incidental or ultimate,
        of  purchasing  or  carrying  any margin  stock  within  the  meaning of
        Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as
        amended from time to time.  ADESA shall not permit more than twenty-five
        percent  (25%) of its  consolidated  assets  to  consist  at any time of
        margin stock,  within the contemplation of Regulation U, as amended form
        time to time.

g.      Other  Agreements.  Neither  ADESA  nor  Funding  shall  enter  into any
        agreement, and ADESA shall not permit any Subsidiary,  excluding AFC, to
        enter  into  any  agreement  containing  any  provision  which  would be
        violated or breached in  material  respect by the  performance  of their
        respective  Obligations  under this Agreement or under any instrument or
        document  delivered or to be  delivered by ADESA,  Funding or any of the
        Subsidiaries under this Agreement or in connection herewith.

h.      Judgments.  Neither ADESA nor Funding shall permit,  and ADESA shall not
        permit any  Subsidiary  to permit any  uninsured  judgment  or  monetary
        penalty rendered against it in any judicial or administrative proceeding
        to remain  unsatisfied  for  period in  excess of  forty-five  (45) days
        unless  such  judgment  or penalty is being  contested  in good faith by
        appropriate  proceedings  and  execution  upon  such  judgment  has been
        stayed,  and unless an  appropriate  reserve has been  established  with
        respect thereto.

i.      Principal  Office.  Neither ADESA nor Funding  shall  change,  and ADESA
        shall not permit any  Subsidiary to change the location of its principal
        office unless it gives not less than ten (10) days prior written  notice
        of such a change to the Agent.

j.      Hazardous Substances. Neither ADESA nor Funding shall allow or permit to
        continue,  and ADESA shall not permit any  Subsidiary to allow permit to
        continue the release or threatened  release of any Hazardous  Substances
        in reportable  quantities on any premises  owned or occupied by or under
        lease to ADESA, Funding or any Subsidiary.

k.      Debt.  Neither  ADESA nor Funding  shall  incur or permit to exist,  and
        ADESA  shall not  permit  any  Subsidiary  (excluding  AFC) to incur nor
        permit  to  exist  any   indebtedness  for  borrowed  money  except  (i)
        indebtedness to the Banks, (ii) the indebtedness of Funding with respect
        to the Floating Rate Notes, (iii) subordinated indebtedness of up to

                                      50
<PAGE>
        $20,000,000  to  ADESA  from  Minnesota   Power  &  Light  Co.,  or  its
        wholly-owned  subsidiary  provided that the  Subordination  Agreement is
        entered into among the Agent,  ADESA and Minnesota Power & Light Co., or
        its wholly-owned  subsidiary;  (iv) those existing obligations disclosed
        on the "Schedule of Exceptions" attached as Schedule 4.e., and (v) other
        indebtedness  which does not exceed  $10,000,000 in aggregate  principal
        amount outstanding at any time for ADESA,  Funding, and the Subsidiaries
        on a consolidated  basis,  excluding AFC. For purposes of this covenant,
        the phrase  "indebtedness  for  borrowed  money,"  shall be construed to
        include equipment lease obligations under capital and operating leases.

l.      Limitation  on  Activities  of Funding.  Funding shall not engage in any
        business  other than lending the proceeds of the Floating  Rate Notes to
        ADESA on such terms that timely  payment by ADESA of the  principal  and
        interest on such loan from  Funding  shall  provide  Funding  with funds
        required to make all payments due on account of the Floating  Rate Notes
        in a timely  manner.  Funding  shall not incur any material  obligations
        other than the  obligation  represented  by the Floating  Rate Notes nor
        shall  it  acquire  any  material  amount  of  assets,  other  than  the
        indebtedness  of ADESA to Funding arising by reason of the loan to ADESA
        of the proceeds of the Floating Rate Notes.

        Section 8. CONDITIONS OF LENDING.  The several  obligations of the Banks
to make the Loans and any Advance, to maintain the Letter of Credit and to issue
any L/C shall be  subject to  fulfillment  of each of the  following  conditions

        the representations  contained in Section 4.d will be construed so as to
        refer to the latest financial statements furnished to the Banks by ADESA
        pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement,  (ii) the representation
        contained  in  Section  4.a  will  be  construed  so as to  include  any
        Subsidiary which may hereafter be formed or acquired by ADESA, and (iii)
        other representations  contained in Section 4 shall be construed to have
        been  modified in  accordance  with any change of which ADESA shall have

b.      Nonpayment of Monetary Obligations.  Failure by ADESA to pay to Bank One
        within  five (5) days of the date when due any amount due to Bank One on
        account of the  obligation of ADESA to reimburse  Bank One on account of
        Drawings under the Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms of Section 3.a

        in an aggregate  amount of $1,000,000,  or default in the performance or
        observance of any obligation or condition with respect to any such other
        indebtedness if the effect of such default is to accelerate the maturity
        of such other  indebtedness or to permit the holder or holders  thereof,
        or any trustee or agent for such holders,  to cause such indebtedness to
        become  due and  payable  prior to its  scheduled  maturity,  unless the
        defaulting  party is  contesting  the  existence of such default in good
        faith and by appropriate  proceedings and that appropriate reserves have
        been established with respect thereto.

d.      Other Material Obligations.  Subject to the expiration of any applicable
        grace period, default by ADESA, Funding or any Subsidiary in the payment
        when due, or in the  performance  or observance of any obligation of, or
        condition agreed to by ADESA,  Funding or any Subsidiary with respect to
        any purchase or lease of real property goods,  securities or services in
        an  aggregate  amount of  $500,000  except  only to the extent  that the
        existence  of any such  default is being  contested in good faith and by
        appropriate   proceedings  and  that  appropriate   reserves  have  been
        established with respect thereto.

        certificate,  financial  statement,  report,  notice,  or other  writing

        covenant or other  provision of this  Agreement  applicable to it, or to

        ADESA from the Agent.

                                      54
<PAGE>


        constitute an Event of Default under any of the preceding  provisions of
        this  Section 9) and  continuance  of such  failure for thirty (30) days
        after notice thereof to ADESA from the Agent.

        Section 10.  EFFECT OF EVENT OF DEFAULT.  When any Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing,  the Required Banks,  acting on behalf of all of the
Banks, may take any or all of the following actions:

a.      Acceleration of the Loans. If any Event of Default  described in Section
        9.e  shall  occur,  the  maturity  of the  Loans  shall  immediately  be
        accelerated and the Notes and the Loans evidenced thereby, and all other
        indebtedness  and  any  other  payment  Obligations  of  ADESA  and  all
        obligations  of Funding and the  Subsidiaries  to the Banks shall become
        immediately  due and  payable,  and the  Commitments  shall  immediately
        terminate,  all  without  notice  of any kind.  When any other  Event of
        Default has occurred and is continuing,  the Agent,  at the direction of
        the Required Banks may  accelerate  payment of the Loans and declare the
        Notes and all  other  payment  Obligations  due and  payable,  whereupon
        maturity of the Loans shall be  accelerated  and the Notes and the Loans
        evidenced  thereby,  and all  other  payment  Obligations  shall  become
        immediately  due and  payable  and  the  Commitments  shall  immediately
        terminate,  all without  notice of any kind.  The Agent on behalf of the
        Banks shall promptly advise ADESA of any such  declaration,  but failure
        to do so shall not impair the effect of such declaration.

b.      Refusal to Reinstate an Interest Drawing.  The Required Banks may direct
        Bank One to refuse to reinstate any Interest Drawing under the Letter of
        Credit by giving  notice to the  Trustee  of such  refusal in the manner
        provided in Section  8.02(m) of the Trust  Indenture and in the form and
        within the time provided under the terms of the Letter of Credit and the
        Required  Banks may direct Bank One to direct the Trustee to  accelerate
        the maturity of the Floating  Rate Notes as provided  under the terms of
        the Trust Indenture.

c.      Floating Rate Note Document Remedies. The Required Banks may direct Bank
        One to notify the  Trustee of the Event of Default  with the result that
        the  Trustee  will,  as  required  by the Trust  Indenture,  declare the
        principal  of all the  Floating  Rate  Notes  and the  interest  accrued
        thereon to be  immediately  due and payable and the  Required  Banks may
        direct Bank One to exercise any other remedy available to Bank One under
        any of the Floating Rate Note Documents.

d.      Deposit to Secure Payment of the Reimbursement Obligation.  The Required
        Banks may demand that ADESA immediately pay to the Agent for the benefit
        of the Banks,  an amount  equal to the Maximum  Available  Credit.  Such
        amount  shall be due and  payable  to the Agent for the  benefit  of the
        Banks immediately upon demand. ADESA grants to the Banks a pledge of and
        security  interest in any and all funds  (hereafter  referred to in this
        subsection as a "Special Collateral Account") paid by ADESA to the Agent
        or in transit to any deposit account or fund,  pursuant to the demand of
        the Banks made  pursuant to this  subsection.  Such pledge and  security
        interest shall secure to the Banks

                                      55
<PAGE>


        all  of  the  Obligations  relating  to  the  Letter  of  Credit.  ADESA
        acknowledges that the Banks would not have an adequate remedy at law for
        failure of ADESA to honor any demand made  pursuant  to this  subsection
        and, therefore, the Required Banks shall have the right to require ADESA
        specifically to perform such undertaking  whether or not any amounts are
        then  due  and  payable  by  ADESA  to  the  Banks  on  account  of  its
        reimbursement  obligation with respect to Drawings made under the Letter
        of  Credit.  In the  event  the Agent  makes a demand  pursuant  to this
        Section  10.d and ADESA  pays the funds  demanded,  the Agent  will hold
        funds in a Special  Collateral  Account  without  liability for interest
        thereon, provided that the Agent will, at the direction of ADESA and for
        the  account  and  risk  of  ADESA,  invest  the  funds  in the  Special
        Collateral  Account  in U.  S.  Treasury  Bills  with  30  days  or less
        remaining until maturity.  Any earnings from such investment may, at the
        discretion of the Required Banks, be released to ADESA. After the Letter
        of Credit has expired and all of the  Obligations  have been  satisfied,
        the Required Banks shall direct the Agent to return to ADESA any balance
        remaining in the Special Collateral Account established  pursuant to the
        requirements of this subsection.

e.      Other  Remedies.  The Agent at the  direction of the Required  Banks may
        pursue any other remedies available to them under any Credit Document or
        any  Floating  Note  Document.  The  Required  Banks may bring any other
        action  available at law or in equity to enforce payment and performance
        or otherwise to collect the Obligations.

The remedies enumerated in this Section 10 are not intended to be exclusive, but
shall be in addition to any other statutory,  equitable or contractual  remedies
available to the Banks.

        Section 11. CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

a.      Change in Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or
        any Note, if at any time any change in  applicable  law or regulation or
        in the interpretation  thereof makes it unlawful for any Bank to make or
        continue to maintain  LIBOR-based Rate Advances or Interbank-based  Rate
        Advances or to give effect to its obligations are  contemplated  hereby,
        such Bank shall promptly give notice  thereof to ADESA,  and such Bank's
        obligations   to  make  or  maintain   LIBOR-based   Rate   Advances  or
        Interbank-based Rate Advances under this Agreement shall terminate until
        it is no longer  unlawful for such bank to make or maintain  LIBOR-based
        Rate Advances or  Interbank-based  Rate Advances.  ADESA shall prepay on
        demand the outstanding principal amount of any such affected LIBOR-based
        Rate  Advances  or  Interbank-based  Rate  Advances,  together  with all
        interest  accrued  thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to
        such Bank under this Agreement; provided, however, subject to all of the
        terms and conditions of this  Agreement,  ADESA may then elect to borrow
        the  principal  amount of the  affected  LIBOR-based  Rate  Advances  or
        Interbank-based  Rate  Advances  from such Bank by means of  Prime-based
        Rate Advances from such Bank that shall not be made ratably by the Banks
        but only from such affected Bank.

                                      56
<PAGE>
b.      Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain,  or Inadequacy Of,
        LIBOR or Interbank Rate. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest
        Period for any Advance of LIBOR-based  Rate Advances or  Interbank-based
        Rate  Advances (i) the Agent  determines  that deposits in United States
        Dollars  (in the  applicable  amounts)  are  not  being  offered  in the
        relevant  market for such Interest  Period,  or (ii) the Required  Banks
        advise the Agent that LIBOR or the  Interbank  Rate, as  applicable,  as
        determined by the Agent will not  adequately and fairly reflect the cost
        to  such  Banks  of  funding   their   LIBOR-based   Rate   Advances  or
        Interbank-based Rate Advances, as applicable,  for such Interest Period,
        then the Agent  shall  forthwith  give  notice  thereof to ADESA and the
        Banks,  whereupon until the Agent notifies ADESA that the  circumstances
        giving rise to such  suspension no longer exist,  the obligations of the
        Banks  to  make  LIBOR-based  Rate  Advances  or  Interbank-based   Rate
        Advances, as applicable, shall be suspended.

c.      Increased Cost and Reduced Return.  (i) If, on or after the date hereof,
        the adoption of any applicable  law, rule or  regulation,  or any change
        therein,  or any change in the interpretation or administration  thereof
        by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
        with the interpretation or administration  thereof, or compliance by any
        Bank (or its Lending Office as defined in Section 11.d) with any request
        or  directive  (whether  or not  having  the  force  of law) of any such
        authority, central bank or comparable agency:

              (a) shall  subject  any Bank (or its  Lending  Office) to any tax,
           duty or other charge with respect to its LIBOR-based Rate Advances or
           Interbank-based  Rate Advances,  its Notes, or its obligation to make
           LIBOR-based Rate Advances or Interbank-based Rate Advances,  or shall
           change the basis of  taxation of payments to any Bank (or its Lending
           Office) of the  principal  of or  interest  on its  LIBOR-based  Rate
           Advances or  Interbank-based  Rate  Advances or any other amounts due
           under this Agreement in respect of its  LIBOR-based  Rate Advances or
           Interbank-based  Rate Advances (except for changes in the rate of tax
           on the overall net income of such Bank or its Lending  Office imposed
           by the jurisdiction in which such Bank's  principal  executive office
           or Lending Office is located); or

              (b) shall impose,  modify or deem applicable any reserve,  special
           deposit or similar requirement  (including,  without limitation,  any
           such  requirement  imposed by the Board of  Governors  of the Federal
           Reserve  System)  against assets of, deposits with or for the account
           of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Lending Office) or on the
           interbank  market or any other  condition  affecting its  LIBOR-based
           Rate Advances or  Interbank-based  Rate Advances,  its Notes,  or its
           obligation to make LIBOR-based Rate Advances or Interbank-based  Rate
           Advances;  and the result of any of the  foregoing is to increase the
           cost to such Bank (or its  Lending  Office) of making or  maintaining
           any LIBOR-based Rate Advances or Interbank-based  Rate Advances or to
           reduce the amount of any sum received or  receivable by such Bank (or
           its  Lending  Office)  under this  Agreement  or under its Notes with
           respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such

                                      57
<PAGE>


           Bank to be material,  then,  within fifteen (15) days after demand by
           such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), ADESA shall be obligated to pay
           to such Bank such  additional  amount or amounts  as will  compensate
           such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

                  (ii) If, any the date hereof, any Bank or the Agent shall have
        determined  that the adoption of any applicable  law, rule or regulation
        regarding capital adequacy,  or any change therein  (including,  without
        limitation,  any revision in the Final Risk-Based  Capital Guidelines of
        the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve  System (12 CFR Part 208,
        Appendix  A;  12 CFR  Part  225,  Appendix  A) or of the  Office  of the
        Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A), or in any other
        applicable   capital  rules   heretofore   adopted  and  issued  by  any
        governmental  authority),   or  any  change  in  the  interpretation  or
        administration  thereof by any governmental  authority,  central bank or
        comparable  agency  charged with the  interpretation  or  administration
        thereof,  or  compliance  by any Bank (or its Lending  Office)  with any
        request or directive  regarding  capital adequacy (whether or not having
        the  force of law) of any such  authority,  central  bank or  comparable
        agency,  has or would have the effect of reducing  the rate of return on
        such Bank's capital,  or on the capital of any  corporation  controlling
        such Bank,  as a  consequence  of its  obligations  hereunder to a level
        below that which such Bank could have  achieved  but for such  adoption,
        change or compliance  (taking into  consideration  such Bank's  policies
        with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be
        material,  then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand
        by such Bank  (with a copy to the  Agent)  ADESA  shall pay to such Bank
        such additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such
        reduction.

                  (iii) Each Bank that  determines  to seek  compensation  under
        this Section 11.c. shall notify ADESA and the Agent of the circumstances
        that  entitle  such Bank to such  compensation  pursuant to this Section
        11.c. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section
        11.c. and setting forth the  additional  amount or amounts to be paid to
        it  hereunder   shall  be   conclusive  in  the  absence  of  errors  in
        calculation.   In  determining  such  amount,  such  Bank  may  use  any
        reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

d.      Lending  Offices.  Each  Bank  may,  at its  option,  elect  to make its
        Advances  hereunder  at the branch,  office or  affiliate  specified  on
        Schedule  A hereof  (each a "Lending  Office")  for each type of Advance
        available  hereunder  or at  such  other  of its  branches,  offices  or
        affiliates  as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written
        notice to ADESA and the Agent.

e.      Discretion  of Bank as to Manner of Funding.  Notwithstanding  any other
        provision  of this  Agreement,  each Bank shall be  entitled to fund and
        maintain its funding of all or any part of its  Commitment in any manner
        it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this
        Agreement all determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had
        actually  funded  and  maintained  each   LIBOR-based  Rate  Advance  or
        Interbank-

                                      58

        based Rate Advance  through the  purchase of deposits in the  eurodollar
        interbank  market  having a  maturity  corresponding  to such  Advance's
        Interest  Period and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR-based  Rate
        or Interbank-based Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period.

        Section 12. THE AGENT.

a.      Appointment.  Each Bank hereby appoints Bank One, Indianapolis,  N.A. as
        the Agent under the Credit Documents, and hereby authorizes the Agent to
        act as the agent on its behalf and to  exercise  such  powers  under the
        Credit  Documents as are  delegated  to the Agent by the terms  thereof,
        together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

b.      Agent and its  Affiliates.  The Agent  shall  have the same  rights  and
        powers under this Agreement and the other Credit  Documents as any other
        Bank and may exercise or refrain from  exercising  the same as though it
        were not the Agent, and the Agent and its affiliates may (without having
        to account  therefor to any Bank) accept  deposits from,  lend money to,
        and  generally  engage in any kind of banking,  trust or other  business
        with ADESA or any  Subsidiary of ADESA as if it were not the Agent under
        the Credit  Documents and may accept fees and other  consideration  from
        ADESA for  services  in  connection  with this  Agreement  or  otherwise
        without  having to account for the same to the Banks except as specified
        herein.  The term  "Bank" or  "Banks"  as used  herein  and in all other
        Credit  Documents,   unless  the  context  otherwise  clearly  requires,
        includes the Agent in its individual capacity as a Bank.

c.      Action by Agent.  In the event  that the  Agent  receives  from  ADESA a
        written  notice of an Event of Default,  the Agent shall  promptly  give
        each of the Banks written notice  thereof.  The obligations of the Agent
        under the Credit  Documents are only those  expressly set forth therein.
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not be
        required  to take any action  hereunder  with  respect to any  Unmatured
        Event of Default or Event of Default,  except as  expressly  provided in
        Section 10. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,  the Agent shall
        take such action  with  respect to the  enforcement  of its liens on the
        collateral and the  preservation  and protection  thereof as it shall be
        directed  to take by the  Required  Banks,  but  unless  and  until  the
        Required Banks have given such direction the Agent shall take or refrain
        from  taking  such  actions  as it  deems  appropriate  and in the  best
        interest  of all the  Banks.  In no event,  however,  shall the Agent be
        required to take any action in  violation  of  applicable  law or of any
        provision  of any Credit  Document,  and the Agent shall in all cases be
        fully  justified  in failing or refusing to act  hereunder  or under any
        other  Credit  Document  unless  it shall be  first  indemnified  to its
        reasonable satisfaction by the Banks against any and all costs, expense,
        and  liability  which  may be  incurred  by it by  reason  of  taking or
        continuing  to take any such  action.  The Agent  shall be  entitled  to
        assume  that no  Unmatured  Event of Default or Event of Default  exists
        unless  notified to the  contrary by a Bank or ADESA or unless the Agent
        has actual knowledge. In all cases in which this Agreement and the other

                                      59
<PAGE>

        Credit Documents do not require the Agent to take certain  actions,  the
        Agent shall be fully  justified  in using its  discretion  in failing to
        take or in taking any action hereunder and thereunder.

d.      Consultation  with  Experts.  The Agent may consult with legal  counsel,
        independent  public  accountants  and other  experts  selected by it and
        shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in
        good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
        experts.

e.      Liability of Agent;  Credit  Decision.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
        directors, officers, agents, or employees shall be liable for any action
        taken or not taken by it in  connection  with the Credit  Documents  (i)
        with the consent or at the request of the Required  Banks or (ii) in the
        absence  of its own gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct,  and any
        action taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto shall be binding on all
        of the  Banks.  Neither  the Agent nor any of its  directors,  officers,
        agents  or  employees  shall  be  responsible  for or have  any  duty to
        ascertain,  inquire  into or  verify  (i)  any  statement,  warranty  or
        representation  made in  connection  with  this  Agreement  or any other
        Credit  Document,  (ii)  the  performance  or  observance  of any of the
        covenants or agreements of ADESA, Funding or the Subsidiaries  contained
        herein or in any other Credit  Document;  (iii) the  satisfaction of any
        condition specified in Section 8 hereof except receipt of items required
        to be  delivered  to the  Agent;  or (iv) the  validity,  effectiveness,
        genuineness, enforceability,  perfection, value, worth or collectibility
        hereof or of any other Credit  Document or of the liens  provided for by
        Section 5 hereof or of any other  documents  or  writings  furnished  in
        connection with any Credit Document or of the collateral;  and the Agent
        makes no  representation  of any kind or  character  with respect to any
        such matter mentioned in this sentence. The Agent may execute any of its
        duties  under  any of the  Credit  Documents  by or  through  employees,
        agents, and  attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Banks,
        ADESA or any other  Person  for the  default or  misconduct  of any such
        agents or  attorneys-in-fact  selected with reasonable care,  except for
        willful  misconduct or gross  negligence.  The Agent shall not incur any
        liability by acting in reliance upon any notice,  consent,  certificate,
        other document or statement  (whether written or oral) believed by it to
        be genuine or to be sent by the proper party or parties.  In  particular
        and  without  limiting  any of the  foregoing,  the Agent  shall have no
        responsibility  for confirming the existence or worth of any collateral,
        compliance  certificate or other  document or instrument  received by it
        under the Credit Documents. The Agent may treat the owner of any Note as
        the holder  thereof  until  written  notice of transfer  shall have been
        filed with the Agent  signed by such owner in form  satisfactory  to the
        Agent.  Each Bank  acknowledges  that it has  independently  and without
        reliance  on  the  Agent  or  any  other  Bank,   and  based  upon  such
        information,  investigations and inquiries as it deems appropriate, made
        its own credit analysis and decision to extend credit to ADESA,  Funding
        and the Subsidiaries in the manner set forth in the Credit Documents. It
        shall be the  responsibility  of each Bank to keep itself informed as to
        the  creditworthiness  of ADESA,  Funding and the  Subsidiaries  and the
        Agent shall have no  liability  to any Bank with  respect  thereto.  The
        Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the


                                      60
<PAGE>

        performance  or  observance  by ADESA of this  Agreement  or the  Credit
        Documents,  or to inspect  the  properties  or books of ADESA  unless an
        inspection  of the  properties  or books is  requested in writing by the
        Required  Banks,  or to access or keep  under  review on its  behalf the
        financial condition,  creditworthiness,  condition,  affairs,  status or
        nature of ADESA.  Each Bank  acknowledges  that a copy of this Agreement
        and a copy of Exhibits  hereto have been made available to it and to its
        individual legal counsel for review and each Bank  acknowledges  that it
        is  satisfied  with the form and  substance  of this  Agreement  and the
        Exhibits hereto.

f.      Costs and  Expenses.  Each Bank  agrees to  reimburse  the Agent for all
        out-of-pocket  expenses  (including  allocated costs of Agent's in-house
        counsel)  suffered  or incurred  by the Agent in  performing  its duties
        hereunder and under the other Credit Documents or in the exercise of any
        right or power  imposed or  conferred  upon the Agent  hereby or thereby
        (except to the  extent  that such  costs and  expenses  arise out of the
        Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct),  to the extent that the
        Agent is not promptly  reimbursed  for the same by ADESA,  or out of the
        collateral, all such costs and expenses to be borne by the Banks ratably
        in accordance with their  respective  shares of the aggregate  amount of
        the Commitments hereunder.

g.      Indemnity.  Each Bank shall ratably, in accordance with their respective
        shares of the aggregate amount of the Commitments  hereunder,  indemnify
        and hold the Agent, and its directors,  officers,  employees, agents and
        representatives  harmless  from and  against  any  liabilities,  losses,
        damages,  penalties,   actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs  or  expenses
        suffered or incurred  by it under any Credit  Document or in  connection
        with the transactions contemplated thereby,  regardless of when asserted
        or arising,  except to the extent they are promptly  reimbursed  for the
        same by ADESA or out of the proceeds of the collateral and except to the
        extent  that  any  event  giving  rise  to a  claim  was  caused  by the
        negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking to be indemnified.
        The  obligations of the Banks under this Section 12.g. and under Section
        12.f. above shall survive termination of this Agreement.

h.      Resignation  of Agent and Successor  Agent.  The Agent may resign at any
        time by giving written  notice thereof to the Banks and ADESA.  Upon any
        such  resignation of the Agent,  the Required Banks shall have the right
        to appoint a successor  Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so
        appointed  by  the  Required   Banks  and  shall  have   accepted   such
        appointment,  within thirty (30) days after the retiring  Agent's giving
        of notice of resignation,  then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
        Banks,  appoint a successor Agent,  which shall be any Bank hereunder or
        any  commercial  bank  organized  under the laws of the United States of
        America  or of any state  thereof  and  having a  combined  capital  and
        surplus of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of its appointment
        as the Agent hereunder,  such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
        and become  vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring  Agent
        under the Credit  Documents,  and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
        from its duties and obligations  thereunder.  After any retiring Agent's
        resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of

                                      61
<PAGE>

        this Section 12 and all  protective  provisions of the Credit  Agreement
        shall  inure to its  benefit  as to any  actions  taken or omitted to be
        taken by it while it was Agent.

i.      Reliance by ADESA. ADESA shall have the right to rely upon the authority
        of the Agent to act  hereunder  unless it has received  actual notice of
        the  resignation  of  the  Agent.  In the  event  of  any  conflicts  or
        inconsistencies between any notices or similar action taken by the Agent
        compared to that of the Banks or the Required Banks, as the case may be,
        ADESA shall be entitled to rely upon the notice or information  provided
        by the Agent until ADESA has received  actual notice of the  resignation
        of the Agent,  in which  event  ADESA  shall be entitled to act upon the
        most recent  documents  provided by the Agent until such  documents  are
        rescinded by the Banks, or the Required Banks, as the case may be, or by
        the successor Agent.

        Section 13. MISCELLANEOUS

a.      Waiver.  No delay on the part of the Agent or the Banks or any holder of
        the Notes in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as
        a waiver thereof,  nor as an acquiescence in any default,  nor shall any
        single or partial exercise by any of them of any right,  power or remedy
        preclude any other or further exercise  thereof,  or the exercise of any
        other right,  power or remedy,  and the rights and remedies hereunder of
        the Agent,  the Banks and the holder of any Note are  cumulative to, and
        not  exclusive  of any  rights  or  remedies  which  any of  them  would
        otherwise have.

b.      Payments Free of Withholding.  Except as otherwise required by law, each
        payment by ADESA  under this  Agreement  or the other  Credit  Documents
        shall be made with  withholding  for or on  account  of any  present  or
        future taxes (other than overall net income taxes measured or based upon
        the  overall  net  income of the  recipient)  imposed  by or within  the
        jurisdiction in which ADESA is domiciled,  any  jurisdiction  from which
        ADESA makes any payment or (in each case) any political  subdivision  or
        taxing  authority  thereof or therein by reason of the  participation by
        the Banks in the  transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement.  If any
        such withholding is so required,  ADESA shall make the withholding,  pay
        the amount withheld to the  appropriate  governmental  authority  before
        penalties  attach thereto or interest  accrues thereon and forthwith pay
        such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
        actually  received  by each  Bank and the  Agent  free and clear of such
        taxes  (including such taxes on such additional  amount) is equal to the
        amount  which  that Bank or the  Agent  (as the case may be) would  have
        received had such  withholding  not been made.  If the Agent or any Bank
        pays any amount in  respect of any such  withheld  taxes,  penalties  or
        interest,  ADESA shall reimburse the Agent or that Bank for that payment
        on demand in the currency in which such payment was made.  If ADESA pays
        any such taxes,  penalties or interest,  it shall  deliver  official tax
        receipts  evidencing  that  payment or certified  copies  thereof to the
        Banks or Agent on whose account such  withholding  was made (with a copy
        to the Agent if not the  recipient  of the  original)  on or before  the
        thirtieth day after payment.  If any Bank or the Agent determines it has
        received or been granted a credit

                                      62
<PAGE>
        against or relief or remission  for, or repayment  of, any taxes paid or
        payable by it because of any taxes,  penalties or interest paid by ADESA
        and  evidenced by such a tax receipt,  such Bank or Agent shall,  to the
        extent it can do so without  prejudice to the retention of the amount of
        such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to ADESA such amount as
        such Bank or Agent  determines  is  attributable  to such  deduction  or
        withholding and which will leave such Bank or Agent (after such payment)
        in no better or worse  position  than it would have been in if ADESA had
        not been required to make such deduction or withholding. Nothing in this
        Agreement  shall  interfere with the right of each Bank and the Agent to
        arrange its tax affairs in whatever  manner it thinks fit nor oblige any
        Bank or the  Agent  to  disclose  any  information  relating  to its tax
        affairs or any computations in connection with such taxes.

c.      Notices. Any notice given under or with respect to this Agreement or any
        other Credit Document to ADESA,  Funding,  any Subsidiary,  the Agent or
        the Banks shall be in writing and, if delivered by hand, shall be deemed
        to have been given when  delivered  and,  if mailed,  shall be deemed to
        have been given five (5) days after the date when sent by  registered or
        certified mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to ADESA,  Funding,  such
        Subsidiary,  the Agent or the  Banks at its  address  shown  below or on

        judgments,   liabilities  and  expenses  of  the  Agent  and  the  Banks
        (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees and legal
        expenses)  incurred  by them in  connection  with or arising  out of the
        enforcement of this Agreement,  the Letter of Credit or any other Credit
        Document or any of the transactions  contemplated  thereby. In the event
        that ADESA, Funding, or a Subsidiary

                                      63
<PAGE>

        shall be the prevailing  party in any action to enforce its rights under
        this  Agreement  against the Agent or any Bank,  then ADESA,  Funding or
        such Subsidiary  shall be entitled to recover its reasonable  attorneys'
        fees and legal expenses in such action or  proceeding.  ADESA shall also
        reimburse the Agent and the Banks for expenses incurred by the Agent and
        the banks in  connection  with any audit of the  books  and  records  or
        physical assets of ADESA and each of the Subsidiaries conducted pursuant
        to any right  granted to the Banks under the terms of this  Agreement or
        any other Credit Document.  Such  reimbursement  shall include,  without
        limitation,  reimbursement of the Agent and the Banks for their overhead
        expenses reasonably  allocated to such audits. In addition,  ADESA shall
        pay or reimburse  the Agent and the Banks for all  expenses  incurred by
        the  Agent  and the  Banks  in  connection  with the  perfection  of any
        security interests granted to the Agent and the Banks by ADESA, Funding,

        transaction  taxes which may be payable in connection with the execution
        or  delivery  of this  Agreement  or any  other  Credit  Document  or in
        connection with any other  instruments or documents  provided for herein
        or  delivered  or required in  connection  herewith  including,  without
        limitation,  expenses  incident  to any  lien or title  search  or title
        insurance  commitment or policy.  All  obligations  provided for in this

        payment  of  principal  of or  interest  on any  Loan  or of  any  other
        Obligation shall fall due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest
        or fees  (as  applicable)  at the  rate,  if  any,  such  Loan or  other
        Obligation  bears for the period  prior to  maturity  shall  continue to
        accrue  on such  Obligation  from the  stated  due date  thereof  to and
        including the next  succeeding  Business Day, on which the same shall be
        payable.

f.      Survival of  Representations.  All  representations  and warranties made
        herein or in  certificates  given  pursuant  hereto  shall  survive  the
        execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
        and shall  continue in full force and effect with respect to the date as
        of which they were made as long as any  Obligations  are due and payable
        or any credit is in use or available hereunder.

g.      Successors and Assigns.  This  Agreement and the other Credit  Documents
        shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of ADESA,  Funding,
        the Agent and the Banks and their  respective  successors  and  assigns,

h.      Participants  and Note Assignees.  Each Bank shall have the right,  with
        the  prior  written   consent  of  ADESA,  at  its  own  cost  to  grant
        participations   (to  be  evidenced  by  one  or  more   agreements   or
        certificates of participation) in the Loans made and/or Commitments held
        by such Bank and its  participation  in the Letter of Credit and any L/C
        at any time and from time to time,  and to assign its rights  under such
        Loans, or the Notes  evidencing  such Loans,  and under the other Credit
        Documents,  to  one  or  more  other  Persons;  provided  that  no  such
        participation  or  assignment  shall  relieve  any  Bank  of  any of its
        obligations under this Agreement,  and,  provided,  further that no such
        assignee  or  participant  shall  have any rights  under this  Agreement
        except as provided in this  Section  13.h.,  and the Agent shall have no
        obligation  or  responsibility  to such  participant  or  assignee.  Any
        agreement  pursuant to which such  participation or assignment of a Note
        or the rights thereunder is granted shall provide that the granting Bank
        shall  retain  the  sole  right  and   responsibility   to  enforce  the
        obligations of ADESA under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
        including,  without  limitation,  the right to  approve  any  amendment,
        modification  or waiver of any  provision of the Credit  Documents.  Any
        Bank  assigning any Note  hereunder  shall give prompt notice thereof to
        ADESA and the Agent,  who shall in each case only be  required  to treat
        such  assignee  of a Note as the holder  thereof  after  receipt of such
        notice.  ADESA,  Funding  and the  Subsidiaries  authorize  each Bank to
        disclose to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of an interest in its
        Loans or its Commitments under this Section 13.h. any financial or other
        information  pertaining to ADESA,  Funding and  Subsidiaries.  ADESA and
        Funding shall not be in privity with any  participant of any Bank and no
        such  participant  shall  have any right to  enforce  any of the  Credit
        Documents  against  ADESA and Funding  other than  through the  granting
        Bank.  In  addition,  no such  participant  shall be entitled to receive
        payment  hereunder of any amount greater than the amount that would have
        been payable had the applicable Bank not granted such participation.

i.      Assignment of Commitments by Banks.  Each Bank shall have the right,  at
        any time with the prior  written  consent of ADESA and  Funding  and the
        Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld to sell, assign, transfer
        or  negotiate  all or any  part of its  Commitment  (including  the same
        percentage of its Note and outstanding  Loans and its  participation  in
        the  Letter of Credit and any  L/C's) to one or more  Persons,  provided
        that  such  assignment  shall be of a fixed  percentage  (and not by its
        terms a varying percentage) of the assigning Bank's Commitment. Any such
        assignee shall become a Bank for all purposes hereunder to the extent of
        the  Commitment it assumes and the assigning Bank shall be released from
        its  obligations,  and will have  released  its rights  under the Credit
        Documents  to the  extent of such  assignment.  ADESA,  Funding  and the
        Subsidiaries  authorize  each  Bank  and the  Agent to  disclose  to any
        purchaser  or  prospective  purchaser  of an  interest  in its  Loans or
        Commitment  under Section  13.h. or 13.i.  hereof any financial or other
        information pertaining to ADESA, Funding and the Subsidiaries.

j.      Amendments.  Any  provision  of the Credit  Documents  may be amended or
        waived if, but only if,  such  amendment  or waiver is in writing and is
        signed by (a) ADESA and

                                      65
<PAGE>

        Funding,  (b) the Required Banks, and (c) if the rights or duties of the
        Agent are affected  thereby,  the Agent;  provided  that no amendment or
        waiver pursuant to this Section shall (i) increase any Commitment of any
        Bank  without  the consent of such Bank,  (ii)  increase  the  aggregate
        amount of all  Commitments,  (iii)  reduce the amount of or postpone any
        fixed date for payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or of
        any fee payable hereunder without the consent of each Bank, (iv) release
        the security  interests or liens on any collateral,  (v) permit ADESA or
        Funding to assign its rights  hereunder,  (vi) change the  provisions of
        this Section, (vii) change the definition of Required Banks or otherwise
        change the percentage of Banks required to take any action  hereunder or
        under  any of  the  other  Credit  Documents,  or  (viii)  decrease  the
        Commitments  other than on a ratable basis, in each case, except for (i)
        above, without the consent of all the Banks.

k.      Set-Off.  In  addition  to any rights  now or  hereafter  granted  under
        applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
        occurrence of any Event of Default, each Bank and each subsequent holder
        of any Note,  subject to Section 5.k.  hereof,  is hereby  authorized by
        ADESA and  Funding at any time or from time to time,  without  notice to
        ADESA or Funding or to any other  Person,  any such notice  being hereby
        expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all
        deposits   (general   or  special,   including,   but  not  limited  to,
        indebtedness  evidenced by certificates  of deposit,  whether matured or
        unmatured,  but not including trust accounts,  and in whatever  currency
        denominated) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by 
        that Bank or that  subsequent  holder to or for the credit or the 
        account of ADESA or Funding,  whether or not matured, against and on
        account of the obligations  and  liabilities  of ADESA or  Funding to
        that Bank or that subsequent holder under the Credit Documents,
        including, but not limited to, all claims of any nature or description 
        arising out of or connected with the Credit Documents,  irrespective of
        whether or not (i) that Bank or that subsequent  holder shall have made
        any demand  hereunder or (ii) the principal of or the interest on the
        Loans or Notes and other amounts due hereunder  shall have become due
        and payable  pursuant to Section 10 hereof and although said 
        obligations and  liabilities,  or any of them, may be contingent or
        unmatured.

l.      Counterparts.   This   Agreement  may  be  executed  in  any  number  of
        counterparts,  and by the different  parties on different  counterparts,
        each of which when  executed  shall be deemed an  original  but all such
        counterparts   taken  together   shall   constitute  one  and  the  same
        instrument.

m.      Severability.  If any  provision  of this  Agreement or any other Credit
        Document is determined to be illegal or  unenforceable,  such  provision
        shall be deemed to be severable  from the balance of the  provisions  of
        this  Agreement  or such Credit  Document and the  remaining  provisions
        shall be enforceable in accordance with their terms.

n.      Captions.  Section  captions used in this Agreement are for  convenience
        only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.

o.      Governing  Law -  Jurisdiction.  This  Agreement  and the  other  Credit
        Documents  are made  under  and  will be  governed  in all  cases by the
        substantive laws of the State of Indiana,  notwithstanding the fact that
        Indiana  conflicts of law rules might otherwise  require the substantive
        rules of law of another  jurisdiction to apply. ADESA,  Funding and each
        Subsidiary  consents to the  jurisdiction  of any state or federal court
        located  within Marion  County,  Indiana.  All service of process may be
        made by messenger,  by certified mail, return receipt  requested,  or by
        registered  mail  directed to ADESA or Funding at the address  stated in
        Section 13.c.  ADESA and Funding each waives any objection  which it may
        have to any  proceeding  commenced  in a federal or state court  located
        within Marion  County,  Indiana,  based upon improper venue or forum non
        conveniens.  Nothing contained in this Section shall affect the right of
        the Agent,  for the benefit of the Banks,  to serve legal process in any
        other  manner  permitted  by law or to bring any  action  or  proceeding
        against ADESA or Funding or their  respective  property in the courts of
        any other jurisdiction.

p.      Prior Agreements, Etc. This Agreement supersedes all previous agreements
        and  commitments  made by the  Banks,  Bank One and  ADESA or any of the
        Subsidiaries  with  respect to the  Loans,  the Letter of Credit and all
        other subjects of this Agreement,  including,  without  limitation,  any
        oral or written  proposals or commitments made or issued by the Banks or
        by Bank One.

        Executed and delivered at Indianapolis,  Indiana as of the 28th day of
        July, 1995.

                         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                         ------------------------------


         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made this 23rd day of February, 1995 by
and between ADESA CORPORATION ("ADESA") and D. Michael Hockett ("Executive").

         WHEREAS,  Minnesota Power & Light Company ("MPL"), ADESA, Executive and
others have entered into a letter  agreement  dated  January 5, 1995 ("Letter of
Intent") which  contemplates,  among other things, that a subsidiary of MPL will
be  merged  with and into  ADESA  (the  "Merger")  pursuant  to the  terms of an
Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date among ADESA, Executive and others (the
"Merger  Agreement"),  that  ADESA  will  survive  the  Merger,  and that (i) in
connection with the Merger,  Executive will sell a portion,  but not all, of his
shares  of common  stock of ADESA  and his  unexercised  stock  options  will be
canceled; and

         WHEREAS,  the Letter of Intent  contemplates that immediately after the
Merger,  MPL will own 80% of the issued and  outstanding  capital stock of ADESA
and  certain   executives  of  ADESA  ("Management   Shareholders"),   including
Executive, will own the remaining 20% of the capital stock of ADESA, in order to
provide the Management Shareholders,  including Executive,  with an incentive to
continue their employment with ADESA; and

         WHEREAS,  MPL will not  undertake  the Merger unless it is assured that
after the Merger,  ADESA will  continue to have  available to it the services of
Executive; and

         WHEREAS, to induce MPL to enter into the Merger Agreement  contemplated
by the Letter of Intent, and thereafter to consummate the Merger,  Executive and
ADESA desire to enter into this Executive Employment  Agreement,  upon the terms
and  conditions  hereof  including  those  providing  for   noncompetition   and
nondisclosure covenants on the part of Executive.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the premises and the  covenants
hereinafter set forth the parties agree as follows:

         1. Employment. ADESA hereby agrees to continue to employ the Executive,
and the Executive hereby accepts such engagement and agrees to continue to serve
ADESA, on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         2. Term.  The  employment  of the  Executive  by ADESA as  provided  in
Section 1 will  commence at the  Effective  Time, as that term is defined in the

terminated as hereinafter provided.

         3.  Position  and Duties.  The  Executive  shall serve as an officer of

Executive by ADESA's board of directors (the "Board") that are  consistent  with
such  responsibilities,   duties  and  authority.  The  Executive  shall  devote
substantially  all his working  time and efforts to the  business and affairs of

         Security Act of 1974,  as amended,  as ADESA may establish and maintain
         from  time to time  during  the term  hereof  and for  which  Executive
         continues to qualify  subject,  however,  to ADESA's  right to amend or
         terminate any such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall
         be  entitled  to  participate  in  the  incentive   compensation   plan

         upon  delivery of a Notice of  Termination  to the  Executive.  For the
         purposes hereof the Executive  shall be deemed  "Disabled" if: (i) as a
         result of the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness,
         including  chemical  dependency,  the Executive  shall have been absent
         from his full time duties with ADESA for six months during any 12 month
         period;  or (ii) the Executive is found to be  permanently  disabled by
         (A) any  insurer  of ADESA  pursuant  to the  terms  of any  disability
         insurance  contract covering Executive which is then in effect, (B) the
         Social  Security   Administration   for  purposes  of  Social  Security
         disability payments, or (C) by any tribunal or court.

            5.3  By  ADESA  for  Cause.  ADESA  may  terminate  the  Executive's
         employment  hereunder for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement,  ADESA
         shall have "Cause" to terminate the  Executive's  employment  hereunder
         upon (a) the failure by the  Executive to perform his  material  duties
         hereunder  after written  demand for  performance is delivered by ADESA
         that  specifically  identifies  the manner in which ADESA  believes the
         Executive has not performed his duties,  or (b) the willful engaging by
         the  Executive in conduct  which is contrary to the interests of ADESA,
         monetarily or otherwise.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Executive
         shall  not be  deemed to have been  terminated  for Cause  without  (1)
         reasonable  notice  to the  Executive  setting  forth the  reasons  for
         ADESA's  intention to terminate for Cause,  (2) an opportunity  for the
         Executive, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board, and
         (3) delivery to the Executive of a Notice of Termination from the Board
         finding that in the good faith  opinion of the Board the  Executive was
         guilty of  conduct  set forth  above in clause (a) or (b)  hereof,  and
         specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

            5.4 By ADESA Without  Cause.  ADESA may  terminate  the  Executive's
         employment  hereunder without Cause upon delivery to the Executive of a
         Notice of Termination.

            5.5 By Executive.  Prior to the expiration of the Term the Executive
         may  terminate  the  Executive's  employment  with ADESA for any of the
         reasons set forth below.

               (a) At any time for Good Reason.  For purposes of this  Agreement
            the term "Good  Reason"  means (i) a failure by ADESA to comply with
            any material  provision of this  Agreement  which has not been cured
            within 10 days after written notice of such  noncompliance  has been
            given  by  the  Executive  to  ADESA,  (ii)  a  substantial  adverse
            alteration   in  the   nature   or   status   of   the   Executive's
            responsibilities,  (iii) that ADESA has required in writing that the
            Executive move his principal  office location to a new location that
            is not the same as ADESA's then principal  place of business or (iv)
            any purported termination of the Executive's employment which is not
            consistent with Sections 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4 hereof; or

               (b) If ADESA imposes  material  restrictions  or  limitations  on
            ADESA's  existing  personnel  or ethics  policies  (except  for such
            changes as are, at any time,  required by law) which are not removed
            within 30 days after written notice of such imposition by Executive.

            5.6  Notice  of  Termination.  Any  termination  of the  Executive's
         employment  by  ADESA  or by  the  Executive  (other  than  termination
         pursuant to  subsection  5.1 hereof) shall be  communicated  by written
         Notice of Termination to the other party hereto. For purposes of this
         Agreement,  a "Notice of  Termination"  shall mean a notice which shall
         indicate the specific  termination  provision in this Agreement  relied
         upon and shall, in the case of a termination  under Section 5.3 or 5.5,
         set forth in reasonable detail the facts and  circumstances  claimed to
         provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the
         provision so indicated.

            5.7 Date of Termination.  "Date of  Termination"  shall mean: (a) if
         the Executive's  employment is terminated by his death, the date of his
         death;  and (b) if the  Executive's  employment is  terminated  for any
         other reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination.

         6. Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability.

            6.1.  During  Disability  and Upon  Termination  Due to  Disability.
         During  any  period  that the  Executive  fails to  perform  his duties
         hereunder as a result of incapacity  due to 

                                          4
<PAGE>

         physical or mental illness ("disability  period"),  the Executive shall
         continue to receive his full base salary at the rate then in effect for
         such period (offset by any payments to the Executive  received pursuant
         to disability benefit plans maintained by ADESA or disability  benefits
         from governmental entities) until his employment is terminated pursuant
         to Section 5.2 hereof,  and upon such termination,  the Executive shall
         be entitled to all amounts to which the Executive is entitled  pursuant
         to applicable law and Employee  Benefit Plans,  all in accordance  with
         the terms  thereof  as  amended  from  time to time.  In  addition,  if
         Executive is terminated under Section 5.2, ADESA will pay to Executive,
         on the date the same would have been payable  under Section 4.2 and the
         Incentive  Compensation Plan if Executive had not been terminated,  any
         Performance  Bonus and any  Incentive  Compensation  Plan payments that
         would  have been  payable  to the  Executive  for the year in which the
         Disability occurred, pro-rated to the Date of Termination.

            6.2.  Death.  If the  Executive's  employment  is  terminated by his
         death, ADESA shall within 10 days following the date of the Executive's
         death pay to the Executive's  estate his full unpaid base salary at the
         rate then in effect, through the Date of Termination, together with any
         other amounts to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to applicable
         law and ADESA Employee  Benefit Plans, all in accordance with the terms
         thereof as  amended  from time to time.  In  addition,  if  Executive's
         employment  is  terminated  under  Section  5.1,  ADESA will pay to the
         Executive's  estate, on the date the same would have been payable under
         Section 4.2 and the  Incentive  Compensation  Plan if Executive had not
         died,  any  Performance  Bonus  and  any  Incentive  Compensation  Plan
         payments  that would have been payable to the Executive for the year in
         which his death occurred, pro-rated to the Date of Termination.

            6.3. By ADESA For Cause or By  Executive  In Breach  Hereof.  If the
         Executive's  employment is  terminated by ADESA for Cause,  ADESA shall
         pay the Executive at the regular time salary payments are due hereunder
         his full base salary through the Date of Termination.  If the Executive
         terminates his employment in breach hereof,  ADESA shall pay Executive,
         at the rate in effect at the time of such termination, through the date
         on which the Executive  terminates  his  employment.  In either of such
         events, except as aforesaid, ADESA shall have no further obligations to
         the Executive  under this  Agreement  and,  except for any claims which
         ADESA may have against Executive (i) for breach of contract, (ii) based
         upon,  related to or arising out of the event or events which  resulted
         in the  termination  of Executive for Cause and (iii) under Sections 7,
         8, 9 and 10 hereof,  Executive  shall have no  further  obligations  to
         ADESA under this Agreement.

         or (b) the  Executive  terminates  his  employment  for Good  Reason as
         defined in Section  5.5(a),  then ADESA shall pay the  Executive at the

         Incentive  Compensation  Plan, any Performance  Bonus and any Incentive
         Compensation  Plan  payments  that  would  have  been  payable  to  the
         Executive under Section 4.2 and the Incentive Compensation Plan for the
         year in which such termination occurred.

            6.5  Termination  by Executive  Under Section  5.5(b).  If Executive

         April 30, 1999. In addition,  ADESA will pay to Executive,  on the date
         the same would have been payable  under  Section 4.2 and the  Incentive
         Compensation Plan, any Performance Bonus and any Incentive Compensation
         Plan  payments  that would have been  payable  to the  Executive  under
         Section 4.2 and the Incentive  Compensation  Plan for the year in which
         such termination  occurred pro-rated to the date on which the Executive
         terminated his employment.

            6.6. Certain Benefit Plans.  Except as otherwise  provided by law or
         any  applicable   Employee  Benefit  Plan,   unless  the  Executive  is
         terminated for Cause or the Executive  terminates  his employment  with
         ADESA in breach of this  Agreement,  the Executive shall be entitled to
         continue to participate,  after  termination,  in all Employee  Benefit
         Plans, to the extent  permitted under the terms thereof as amended from
         time to time,  but ADESA shall have no  obligation  to make any further
         payments with respect thereto on behalf of Executive.

                  7. Non-Disclosure. Executive acknowledges that he has received
and will continue to receive and  contribute to the  production of  Confidential
Information.  Except as required by his duties  hereunder,  Executive  will not,

if Executive is receiving  payments under Section 6.4 hereof) or for three years
thereafter, use any Confidential Information for his own benefit or disclose any
Confidential  Information to any third person.  The Executive  agrees to refrain
from any acts or  omissions  that  would  reduce  the value of the  Confidential
Information.  Upon termination of Executive's  employment with ADESA,  Executive
shall leave with or return to ADESA all records,  correspondence,  compositions,
articles,  writing,  programs, codes, devices,  equipment,  prototypes and other
papers  which  incorporate,  embody or  disclose  any  

                                          6
<PAGE>

Confidential  Information  (whether  written,  prepared or made by  Executive or
others),  including all copies and memorializations thereof. The obligations set
forth in this  Section 7 shall not apply to any  information  or  knowledge  the
entirety of which is now publicly known or subsequently  becomes publicly known,
other than as a direct or indirect result of the breach of this Agreement by the
Executive  or the breach of a  confidentiality  obligation  owed to ADESA by any
third party. For the purposes hereof:

               (a) The term "Confidential  Information" means all information or
            material  proprietary  to  ADESA  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  or
            designated  as  Confidential  Information  by  ADESA  or  any of its
            subsidiaries  and not  generally  known other than by  personnel  of
            ADESA  or  its  subsidiaries,  of  or  to  which  Executive  obtains
            knowledge  or  access   through  or  as  a  result  of   Executive's
            relationship  (whether  prior or subsequent to the date hereof) with
            ADESA (including  information conceived,  originated,  discovered or
            developed   in  whole  or  in  part  by   Executive).   Confidential
            Information includes,  but is not limited to, the following types of
            information  and other  information of a similar nature  (whether or
            not reduced to  writing),  discoveries,  inventions  (whether or not
            patentable),   ideas,  concepts,   software  in  various  stages  of
            development, designs, drawings, specifications,  techniques, models,
            data, devices, source codes, object codes, documentation,  formulae,
            patterns,   computations,   diagrams,   flow  charts,  research  and
            development data, programs, processes,  procedures,  know-how, Trade
            Secrets,   marketing   techniques  and   materials,   marketing  and
            development plans,  customer names and other information  related to
            customers,  price lists, pricing policies and financial information.
            Confidential  Information  also includes any  information  described
            above which ADESA or any of its  subsidiaries  obtains  from another
            party  and  which  ADESA  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  treats  as
            proprietary or designates as  Confidential  Information,  whether or
            not owned by or developed by ADESA or any of its subsidiaries.

               (b) The term  "Trade  Secrets"  means  information,  including  a
            formula pattern,  compilation,  program device, method, technique or
            process,   that  derives  independent   economic  value,  actual  or
            potential,  from not being generally known to, and not being readily
            ascertainable  by proper  means by,  other  persons  who can  obtain
            economic  value from its  disclosure  or use,  and is the subject of
            efforts that are reasonable under the  circumstances to maintain its
            secrecy.

         8. Covenant Not to Compete.

            8.1  Agreement  Not To Compete.  The  Executive  agrees that,  for a
         period  of  three  (3)  years  commencing  on  the  later  of  (i)  his
         termination  of employment or (ii) the date the last payment is made to
         Executive under Section 6.4 or Section 6.5 hereof, he will not within a
         territory  consisting  of the  continental  United  States and  Canada,
         engage or be  interested  in (x) the  vehicle  redistribution  business
         (except that  Executive  may engage in the retail or wholesale  sale of
         vehicles,  other than as an owner of,  employee of or  consultant  to a
         vehicle  auction),  (y) the vehicle auction  business or (z) the dealer
         floorplan  financing  business.  The  Executive  shall be  deemed to be
         interested  in a business if the  Executive is engaged or interested in
         that  business  as  a   shareholder,   director,   officer,   employee,
         independent   contractor,   agent,  partner,   individual   proprietor,
         consultant or otherwise,  but not if such interest is limited solely to
         passive investments  existing on the date hereof or the ownership of 5%
         or fewer of the equity or debt  securities  of any entity  whose shares
         are listed for trading on a national  securities  exchange or traded in
         the over the counter market.

            8.2 Indirect Competition.  The Executive agrees that during the term
         of his employment (or until April 30, 1999, if longer, and if Executive
         is  receiving  payments  under  Section  6.4 hereof) by ADESA and for a
         period of three years  thereafter,  the Executive will not, directly or
         indirectly,  assist or  encourage  any other  person in  carrying  out,
         directly or  indirectly,  any activity  that would be prohibited by the
         provisions  of Section  8.1 if such  activity  were  carried out by the
         Executive  either directly or indirectly.  In particular,  but not as a
         limitation,  the  Executive  agrees  that  he  will  not,  directly  or
         indirectly,  induce any employee of ADESA or any of its subsidiaries to
         carry out, directly or indirectly, any such activity.

            8.3 Necessary and Reasonable;  Ancillary to Purchase.  The Executive
         agrees that the  covenants  provided for in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 hereof
         are  ancillary  to the  purchase  of  stock  of  ADESA  by MPL  and are
         necessary and  reasonable in order to protect ADESA,  its  subsidiaries
         and MPL in the conduct of their  respective  businesses  and to protect
         ADESA,  its  subsidiaries  and MPL in the  utilization  of the  assets,
         tangible and intangible,  including the goodwill of ADESA, purchased by
         MPL pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

         9. No  Solicitation.  The Executive  agrees that during the term of his
employment  by ADESA (or until April 30,  1999,  if longer,  and if Executive is
receiving  payments  under  Section  6.4 hereof) and for a period of three years
thereafter he will not, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or another,
solicit

                                          8
<PAGE>

the  hiring  on  any  basis  of  any  person  employed  by  ADESA  or any of its
subsidiaries.

         10. Injunctive  Relief. The Executive agrees that it would be difficult
to compensate ADESA, its subsidiaries or MPL fully for damages for any violation
of the  provisions of Sections 7, 8, or 9 of this  Agreement.  Accordingly,  the
Executive  specifically  agrees that any of ADESA, its subsidiaries or MPL shall
be  entitled  to  temporary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief to  enforce  the
provisions  of this  Agreement,  that such  relief  may be granted  without  the
necessity of proving  actual  damages,  and that,  in  connection  with any such
proceeding the Executive shall waive the defense that ADESA, its subsidiaries or
MPL,  as the case may be, has an adequate  remedy at law.  This  provision  with
respect to injunctive  relief shall not,  however,  diminish the right of ADESA,
its  subsidiaries  or MPL to claim and recover damages in addition to injunctive
relief.

         11.  Arbitration  of all  Disputes.  Except for matters  arising  under
Sections  7, 8, 9 or 10  hereof,  any  controversy  or claim  arising  out of or
relating  to  this  Agreement,  or the  breach  thereof,  shall  be  settled  by
arbitration in the City of Indianapolis,  Indiana,  in accordance with the rules
of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, or, if the parties shall
agree in writing,  by  mediation,  and judgment  upon the award  rendered by the
arbitrators or mediator,  as the case may be, may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.

         12. Early  Termination of Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10. Sections 7, 8, 9 and
10 hereof shall apply only so long as (i) ADESA and its subsidiaries continue to
be engaged in the vehicle  auction  business as a principal line of business and
(ii) MPL and the Management  Shareholders  own more than 50% of the  outstanding
shares of common stock of ADESA.

         13. Miscellaneous.

            13.1  Recitals.  The recitals to this Agreement are true and correct
         and constitute substantive provisions of this Agreement.

            13.2  No  Assignment.  Neither  this  Agreement  nor any  rights  or
         obligations  hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any party hereto
         without the written consent of the other parties.

            13.3   Notices.   Any   notices,   requests,   demands   and   other
         communications  provided for by this Agreement  shall be in writing and

         the  case  of  ADESA,  to its  principal  executive  office,  attention
         President.  All  notices  shall be  copied  to MPL at 30 West  Superior
         Street, Duluth, Minnesota 55822, Attention: Chairman of the Board. Such
         notice  shall be deemed to be  received  when  delivered  if  delivered
         personally,  the next  business day after  receipt of  electronic  sent
         confirmation (or other confirmation of receipt) if telecopied, the next
         business day if sent by a national overnight delivery service, or three
         business  days after the date mailed if sent by certified or registered
         mail.  Whenever  the giving of notice is  required,  the giving of such
         notice may be waived in writing by the party  entitled to receive  such
         notice.

            13.4  Governing  Law.  The  provisions  of this  Agreement  shall be
         construed and the rights and  obligations of the parties  determined in
         accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana,  notwithstanding  the
         choice of law rules of Indiana or any other jurisdiction.

            13.5 Entire  Agreement;  Amendment.  This  Agreement  sets forth the
         entire agreement of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter
         contained  herein  and  supersedes  all  prior  agreements,   promises,
         covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties,
         whether oral or written, by any officer,  employee or representative of
         any party  hereto;  and any prior  agreement  of the parties  hereto in
         respect of the subject matter contained  herein shall,  with respect to
         the Executive, be of no further force or effect. This Agreement may not
         be modified or amended  without the prior  written  consent of MPL, and
         then may only be modified or amended by an  instrument  in writing duly
         executed by Executive and ADESA.

            13.6 Meanings of Pronouns;  Singular and Plural Words.  All pronouns
         used in this  Agreement  shall be  deemed  to  refer to the  masculine,
         feminine, neuter, singular and plural, as the identity of the person to
         which or to whom  reference is made may require.  Unless the context in
         which it is used shall clearly indicate to the contrary,  words used in
         the  singular  shall  include the plural,  and words used in the plural
         shall include the singular.

            13.7  Interpretation.  When a reference is made in this Agreement to
         Sections or Exhibits such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit to
         this  Agreement   unless  otherwise   indicated.   Whenever  the  words
         "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this Agreement,  they
         shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

            13.8 Benefit.  This  Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and be
         enforceable  by  Executive  or  by   Executive's   personal  and  legal
         representatives,   executors,   administrators,   heirs,  devisees  and
         legatees. In addition, it is the intention of 

                                          10
<PAGE>

         the parties that MPL be a third party  beneficiary  of this  Agreement,
         entitled to enforce this Agreement for and on behalf of ADESA.

            13.9  Severability.  To  the  extent  that  any  provision  of  this
         Agreement  shall be  determined  to be  invalid or  unenforceable,  the
         invalid or  unenforceable  portion of such  provision  shall be deleted
         from  this  Agreement,  and  the  validity  and  enforceability  of the
         remainder of such provision and of this Agreement  shall be unaffected.
         The Executive  acknowledges  the uncertainty of the law in this respect
         and expressly  stipulates  that this Agreement  shall be construed in a
         manner  which  renders  its  provisions  valid and  enforceable  to the
         maximum  extent  (not  exceeding  its  express  terms)  possible  under
         applicable law.

            13.10  Counterparts.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
         counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
         of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

            13.11 Survival.  Except as provided in Section 12, the provisions of
         Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement
         and the termination of the Executive's employment hereunder.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties  have  executed  and  delivered  this
Agreement on the day and year first written above, effective as aforesaid.

effective May 1, 1995.

         WHEREAS, Employee and Minnesota Power desire to enter into an agreement
with respect to certain aspects of the employment  relationship existing between
them; and

         WHEREAS, Employee enters into this agreement voluntarily and of his own
free will and deed;

                                                                 2/23/95

                         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made this 23rd day of February, 1995 by
and between ADESA CORPORATION ("ADESA") and Larry S. Wechter ("Executive").

         WHEREAS,  Minnesota Power & Light Company ("MPL"), ADESA, Executive and
others have entered into a letter  agreement  dated  January 5, 1995 ("Letter of
Intent") which  contemplates,  among other things, that a subsidiary of MPL will
be  merged  with and into  ADESA  (the  "Merger")  pursuant  to the  terms of an
Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date among ADESA, Executive and others (the
"Merger  Agreement"),  that  ADESA  will  survive  the  Merger,  and that (i) in
connection with the Merger,  Executive will sell a portion,  but not all, of his
shares  of common  stock of ADESA  and his  unexercised  stock  options  will be
canceled; and

         WHEREAS,  the Letter of Intent  contemplates that immediately after the
Merger,  MPL will own 80% of the issued and  outstanding  capital stock of ADESA
and  certain   executives  of  ADESA  ("Management   Shareholders"),   including
Executive, will own the remaining 20% of the capital stock of ADESA, in order to
provide the Management Shareholders,  including Executive,  with an incentive to
continue their employment with ADESA; and

         WHEREAS,  MPL will not  undertake  the Merger unless it is assured that
after the Merger,  ADESA will  continue to have  available to it the services of
Executive; and

         WHEREAS, to induce MPL to enter into the Merger Agreement  contemplated
by the Letter of Intent, and thereafter to consummate the Merger,  Executive and
ADESA desire to enter into this Executive Employment  Agreement,  upon the terms
and  conditions  hereof  including  those  providing  for   noncompetition   and
nondisclosure covenants on the part of Executive.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the premises and the  covenants
hereinafter set forth the parties agree as follows:

ADESA, on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         2. Term.  The  employment  of the  Executive  by ADESA as  provided  in
Section 1 will  commence at the  Effective  Time, as that term is defined in the

terminated as hereinafter provided.

         3.  Position  and Duties.  The  Executive  shall serve as an officer of

Executive by ADESA's board of directors (the "Board") that are  consistent  with
such  responsibilities,   duties  and  authority.  The  Executive  shall  devote
substantially  all his working  time and efforts to the  business and affairs of

         3(3)  of the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act of  1974,  as
         amended,  as ADESA may  establish and maintain from time to time during
         the term hereof and for which Executive  continues to qualify  subject,
         however,  to  ADESA's  right  to  amend or  terminate  any  such  plan.
         Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,   Executive   shall  be  entitled  to
         participate in the incentive  compensation plan contemplated by Section
         7.6 of and Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement  ("Incentive  Compensation

<PAGE>

         Termination  to the  Executive.  For the purposes  hereof the Executive
         shall be  deemed  "Disabled"  if:  (i) as a result  of the  Executive's
         incapacity  due to  physical  or  mental  illness,  including  chemical
         dependency,  the  Executive  shall have been  absent from his full time
         duties with ADESA for six months  during any 12 month  period;  or (ii)
         the Executive is found to be permanently disabled by (A) any insurer of
         ADESA  pursuant  to the  terms  of any  disability  insurance  contract
         covering  Executive  which is then in effect,  (B) the Social  Security
         Administration for purposes of Social Security disability payments,  or

            5.3  By  ADESA  for  Cause.  ADESA  may  terminate  the  Executive's
         employment  hereunder for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement,  ADESA
         shall have "Cause" to terminate the  Executive's  employment  hereunder
         upon (a) the failure by the  Executive to perform his  material  duties
         hereunder  after written  demand for  performance is delivered by ADESA
         that  specifically  identifies  the manner in which ADESA  believes the
         Executive has not performed his duties,  or (b) the willful engaging by
         the  Executive in conduct  which is contrary to the interests of ADESA,
         monetarily or otherwise.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Executive
         shall  not be  deemed to have been  terminated  for Cause  without  (1)
         reasonable  notice  to the  Executive  setting  forth the  reasons  for
         ADESA's  intention to terminate for Cause,  (2) an opportunity  for the
         Executive, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board, and
         (3) delivery to the Executive of a Notice of Termination from the Board
         finding that in the good faith  opinion of the Board the  Executive was
         guilty of  conduct  set forth  above in clause (a) or (b)  hereof,  and
         specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

            5.4 By ADESA Without  Cause.  ADESA may  terminate  the  Executive's
         employment  hereunder without Cause upon delivery to the Executive of a
         Notice of Termination.

         may  terminate  the  Executive's  employment  with ADESA for any of the
         reasons set forth below.

<PAGE>

                (a) At any time for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement
            the term "Good  Reason"  means (i) a failure by ADESA to comply with
            any material  provision of this  Agreement  which has not been cured
            within 10 days after written notice of such  noncompliance  has been
            given  by  the  Executive  to  ADESA,  (ii)  a  substantial  adverse
            alteration   in  the   nature   or   status   of   the   Executive's
            responsibilities,  (iii) that ADESA has required in writing that the
            Executive move his principal  office location to a new location that
            is not the same as ADESA's then principal  place of business or (iv)
            any purported termination of the Executive's employment which is not
            consistent with Sections 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4 hereof; or

                (b) If ADESA imposes  material  restrictions  or  limitations on
            ADESA's  existing  personnel  or ethics  policies  (except  for such
            changes as are, at any time,  required by law) which are not removed
            within 30 days after written notice of such imposition by Executive.

            5.6  Notice  of  Termination.  Any  termination  of the  Executive's
         employment  by  ADESA  or by  the  Executive  (other  than  termination
         pursuant to  subsection  5.1 hereof) shall be  communicated  by written
         Notice of Termination  to the other party hereto.  For purposes of this
         Agreement,  a "Notice of  Termination"  shall mean a notice which shall
         indicate the specific  termination  provision in this Agreement  relied
         upon and shall, in the case of a termination  under Section 5.3 or 5.5,
         set forth in reasonable detail the facts and  circumstances  claimed to
         provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the
         provision so indicated.

            5.7 Date of Termination.  "Date of  Termination"  shall mean: (a) if
         the Executive's  employment is terminated by his death, the date of his
         death;  and (b) if the  Executive's  employment is  terminated  for any
         other reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination.

            6.1.  During  Disability  and Upon  Termination  Due to  Disability.
         During  any  period  that the  Executive  fails to  perform  his duties
         hereunder as a result of incapacity  due to physical or mental  illness
         ("disability period"), the Executive shall continue to receive his full
         base salary at the rate then in effect for such  period  (offset by any
         payments to the Executive received pursuant to disability benefit plans
         maintained by ADESA or disability benefits from governmental  entities)
         until his employment is terminated  pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof, and
         upon such  termination,  the Executive shall be entitled to all amounts
         to which the  Executive  is  entitled  pursuant to  applicable  law and
         Employee  Benefit  Plans,  all in accordance  with the terms thereof as
         amended  from time to time.  In addition,  if  Executive is  terminated
         under Section 5.2,  ADESA will pay to  Executive,  on the date the same
         would  have  been  payable   under   Section  4.2  and  the   Incentive
         Compensation Plan if Executive had not been terminated, any Performance
         Bonus and any Incentive Compensation Plan payments that would have been
         payable to the Executive for the year in which the Disability occurred,
         pro-rated to the Date of Termination.

            6.2.  Death.  If the  Executive's  employment  is  terminated by his
         death, ADESA shall within 10 days following the date of the Executive's
         death pay to the Executive's  estate his full unpaid base salary at the
         rate then in effect, through the Date of Termination, together with any
         other amounts to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to applicable
         law and ADESA Employee  Benefit Plans, all in accordance with the terms
         thereof as  amended  from time to time.  In  addition,  if  Executive's
         employment  is  terminated  under  Section  5.1,  ADESA will pay to the
         Executive's  estate, on the date the same would have been payable under
         Section 4.2 and the  Incentive  Compensation  Plan if Executive had not
         died,  any  Performance  Bonus  and  any  Incentive  Compensation  Plan
         payments  that would have been payable to the Executive for the year in
         which his death occurred, pro-rated to the Date of Termination.

            6.3. By ADESA For Cause or By  Executive  In Breach  Hereof.  If the
         Executive's  employment is  terminated by ADESA for Cause,  ADESA shall
         pay the Executive at the regular time

<PAGE>

         salary payments are due hereunder his full base salary through the Date
         of  Termination.  If the Executive  terminates his employment in breach
         hereof, ADESA shall pay Executive, at the rate in effect at the time of
         such  termination,  through the date on which the Executive  terminates
         his employment.  In either of such events,  except as aforesaid,  ADESA
         shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement
         and,  except for any claims which ADESA may have against  Executive (i)
         for breach of contract,  (ii) based upon,  related to or arising out of
         the event or events which resulted in the  termination of Executive for
         Cause and (iii) under Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 hereof,  Executive  shall
         have no further obligations to ADESA under this Agreement.

            6.4 Without  Cause or by  Executive  For Good  Reason.  If (a) ADESA
         terminates the Executive's  employment without Cause under Section 5.4,
         or (b) the  Executive  terminates  his  employment  for Good  Reason as
         defined in Section  5.5(a),  then ADESA shall pay the  Executive at the
         regular  time salary  payments are due  hereunder  his full base salary
         through  April 30,  1999 at the rate in  effect  at the time  Notice of
         Termination is given. In addition,  ADESA will pay to Executive, on the
         date the  same  would  have  been  payable  under  Section  4.2 and the
         Incentive  Compensation  Plan, any Performance  Bonus and any Incentive
         Compensation  Plan  payments  that  would  have  been  payable  to  the
         Executive under Section 4.2 and the Incentive Compensation Plan for the
         year in which such termination occurred.

            6.5  Termination  by Executive  Under Section  5.5(b).  If Executive
         terminates his employment with ADESA under Section  5.5(b),  then ADESA

         April 30, 1999. In addition,  ADESA will pay to Executive,  on the date
         the same would have been payable  under  Section 4.2 and the  Incentive
         Compensation Plan, any Performance Bonus and any Incentive Compensation
         Plan  payments  that would have been  payable  to the  Executive  under

            6.6. Certain Benefit Plans.  Except as otherwise  provided by law or
         any  applicable   Employee  Benefit  Plan,   unless  the  Executive  is
         terminated for Cause or the Executive  terminates  his employment  with
         ADESA in breach of this  Agreement,  the Executive shall be entitled to
         continue to participate,  after  termination,  in all Employee  Benefit
         Plans, to the extent  permitted under the terms thereof as amended from
         time to time,  but ADESA shall have no  obligation  to make any further
         payments with respect thereto on behalf of Executive.

         7. Non-Disclosure. Executive acknowledges that he has received and will
continue  to  receive  and   contribute  to  the   production  of   Confidential
Information.  Except as required by his duties  hereunder,  Executive  will not,
either during his  employment by ADESA (or until April 30, 1999, if longer,  and
if Executive is receiving  payments under Section 6.4 hereof) or for three years
thereafter, use any Confidential Information for his own benefit or disclose any
Confidential  Information to any third person.  The Executive  agrees to refrain
from any acts or  omissions  that  would  reduce  the value of the  Confidential
Information.  Upon termination of Executive's  employment with ADESA,  Executive
shall leave with or return to ADESA all records,  correspondence,  compositions,
articles,  writing,  programs, codes, devices,  equipment,  prototypes and other
papers  which  incorporate,  embody or  disclose  any  Confidential  Information
(whether written, prepared or made by Executive or others), including all copies
and memorializations  thereof. The obligations set forth in this Section 7 shall
not apply to any  information or knowledge the entirety of which is now publicly
known or subsequently becomes publicly known, other than as a direct or indirect
result of the  breach of this  Agreement  by the  Executive  or the  breach of a

         8. Covenant Not to Compete.

            8.1  Agreement  Not To Compete.  The  Executive  agrees that,  for a
         period  of  three  (3)  years  commencing  on  the  later  of  (i)  his
         termination  of employment or (ii) the date the last payment is made to
         Executive under Section 6.4 or Section 6.5 hereof, he will not within a
         territory  consisting  of the  continental  United  States and  Canada,
         engage or be  interested  in (x) the  vehicle  redistribution  business
         (except that  Executive  may engage in the retail or wholesale  sale of
         vehicles,  other than as an owner of,  employee of or  consultant  to a
         vehicle  auction),  (y) the vehicle auction  business or (z) the dealer
         floorplan  financing  business.  The  Executive  shall be  deemed to be
         interested  in a business if the  Executive is engaged or interested in
         that  business  as  a   shareholder,   director,   officer,   employee,
         independent   contractor,   agent,  partner,   individual   proprietor,
         consultant or otherwise,  but not if such interest is limited solely to
         passive investments  existing on the date hereof or the ownership of 5%
         or fewer of the equity or debt  securities  of any entity  whose shares
         are listed for trading on a national  securities  exchange or traded in
         the over the counter market.

            8.2 Indirect Competition.  The Executive agrees that during the term
         of his employment (or until April 30, 1999, if longer, and if Executive
         is  receiving  payments  under  Section  6.4 hereof) by ADESA and for a
         period of three years  thereafter,  the Executive will not, directly or
         indirectly,  assist or  encourage  any other  person in  carrying  out,
         directly or  indirectly,  any activity  that would be prohibited by the
         provisions  of Section  8.1 if such  activity  were  carried out by the
         Executive  either directly or indirectly.  In particular,  but not as a
         limitation,  the  Executive  agrees  that  he  will  not,  directly  or
         indirectly,  induce any employee of ADESA or any of its subsidiaries to
         carry out, directly or indirectly, any such activity.

            8.3 Necessary and Reasonable;  Ancillary to Purchase.  The Executive
         agrees that the  covenants  provided for in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 hereof
         are  ancillary  to the  purchase  of  stock  of  ADESA  by MPL  and are
         necessary and  reasonable in 


                                        10
<PAGE>

            order to protect ADESA,  its  subsidiaries and MPL in the conduct of
            their  respective  businesses and to protect ADESA, its subsidiaries
            and MPL in the  utilization of the assets,  tangible and intangible,
            including  the  goodwill of ADESA,  purchased by MPL pursuant to the
            Merger Agreement.

         9. No  Solicitation.  The Executive  agrees that during the term of his
employment  by ADESA (or until April 30,  1999,  if longer,  and if Executive is
receiving  payments  under  Section  6.4 hereof) and for a period of three years
thereafter he will not, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or another,
solicit  the hiring on any basis of any person  employed  by ADESA or any of its
subsidiaries.

         10. Injunctive  Relief. The Executive agrees that it would be difficult
to compensate ADESA, its subsidiaries or MPL fully for damages for any violation
of the  provisions of Sections 7, 8, or 9 of this  Agreement.  Accordingly,  the
Executive  specifically  agrees that any of ADESA, its subsidiaries or MPL shall
be  entitled  to  temporary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief to  enforce  the
provisions  of this  Agreement,  that such  relief  may be granted  without  the
necessity of proving  actual  damages,  and that,  in  connection  with any such
proceeding the Executive shall waive the defense that ADESA, its subsidiaries or
MPL,  as the case may be, has an adequate  remedy at law.  This  provision  with
respect to injunctive  relief shall not,  however,  diminish the right of ADESA,
its  subsidiaries  or MPL to claim and recover damages in addition to injunctive
relief.

         11.  Arbitration  of all  Disputes.  Except for matters  arising  under
Sections  7, 8, 9 or 10  hereof,  any  controversy  or claim  arising  out of or
relating  to  this  Agreement,  or the  breach  thereof,  shall  be  settled  by
arbitration in the City of Indianapolis,  Indiana,  in accordance with the rules
of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, or, if the parties shall
agree in writing,  by  mediation,  and judgment  upon the award  rendered by the
arbitrators or mediator,  as the case may be, may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.

         12. Early  Termination of Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10. Sections 7, 8, 9 and
10 hereof shall apply only so long as (i) ADESA and its subsidiaries continue to
be engaged in the vehicle  auction  


                                        11
<PAGE>

business  as a  principal  line of  business  and  (ii)  MPL and the  Management
Shareholders  own more than 50% of the  outstanding  shares  of common  stock of
ADESA.

         covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties,
         whether oral or written, by any officer,  employee or representative of
         any party  hereto;  and any prior  agreement  of the parties  hereto in
         respect of the subject matter contained  herein shall,  with respect to
         the Executive, be of no further force or effect. This Agreement may not
         be modified or amended  without the prior  written  consent of MPL, and
         then may only be modified or amended by an  instrument  in writing duly
         executed by Executive and ADESA.

            13.6 Meanings of Pronouns;  Singular and Plural Words.  All pronouns
         used in this  Agreement  shall be  deemed  to  refer to the  masculine,
         feminine, neuter, singular and plural, as the identity of the person to
         which or to whom  reference is made may require.  Unless the context in
         which it is used shall clearly indicate to the contrary,  words used in
         the  singular  shall  include the plural,  and words used in the plural
         shall include the singular.

            13.7  Interpretation.  When a reference is made in this Agreement to
         Sections or Exhibits such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit to
         this  Agreement   unless  otherwise   indicated.   Whenever  the  words
         "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this Agreement,  they
         shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

            13.8 Benefit.  This  Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and be
         enforceable  by  Executive  or  by   Executive's   personal  and  legal
         representatives,   executors,   administrators,   heirs,  devisees  and
         legatees. In addition, it is the intention of the parties that MPL be a
         third party  beneficiary  of this  Agreement,  entitled to enforce this
         Agreement for and on behalf of ADESA.

            13.9  Severability.  To  the  extent  that  any  provision  of  this

                                        13
<PAGE>

         provision  shall be deleted from this  Agreement,  and the validity and
         enforceability of the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement
         shall be unaffected.  The Executive acknowledges the uncertainty of the
         law in this respect and expressly  stipulates that this Agreement shall
         be  construed  in a manner  which  renders  its  provisions  valid  and
         enforceable  to the maximum  extent (not  exceeding its express  terms)
         possible under applicable law.

            13.10  Counterparts.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
         counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
         of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

            13.11 Survival.  Except as provided in Section 12, the provisions of
         Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement
         and the termination of the Executive's employment hereunder.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties  have  executed  and  delivered  this
Agreement on the day and year first written above, effective as aforesaid.

         Shareholders' Notices of Exercise for that Put Date exceeds the Maximum
         Number of Shares for that Put Date,  then each request by a Shareholder
         that MPL purchase his Shares on that Put Date shall be  proportionately
         reduced  so that the  total  number  of  Shares  to be  purchased  from
         Shareholders pursuant to the Shareholders' Notices of Exercise

                                        2
<PAGE>

         for that Put Date does not exceed the Maximum Number of Shares for that
         date.

            2.2 Price.  The purchase price for each Share to be purchased  under
         Section 2.1 shall be the per share EBITDA as of the Put Date, determine
         by dividing  EBITDA as of the Put Date by the  weighted  daily  average
         number of shares of capital stock of ADESA  outstanding  during the 365
         day period ending on the Put Date. In  determining  the weighted  daily
         average  number of  shares  of ADESA  capital  stock  outstanding,  the
         outstanding  shares of ADESA capital stock shall be deemed increased by
         the number of share of ADESA which James P.  Hallett  ("James")  and/or
         Helene  Hallett  ("Helene")  would own if their then owned ADESA Canada
         shares were converted  into ADESA shares at a conversion  ration of 9.8
         ADESA shares for each share of ADESA Canada and such  increased  number
         of shares  shall be deemed to have been  outstanding  during the entire
         365-day period ending on the Put Date.

         3. MPL's Right to Call Shares Owned by Shareholder.

            3.1 Number of  Shares. At least 5 days prior to each Call Date,  MPL
         shall  inform  each  Shareholder  in  writing  whether  MPL  desires to
         purchase from that Shareholder on that Call Date any of his Shares and,
         if so, the number of Shares to be purchased  (a "Notice of  Exercise").
         MPL may not purchase  under  Sections 2.1 and 3.1 a number of Shares in
         excess of the Maximum Number of Shares for that Call Date. In addition,
         purchases under Section 3.1 from each Shareholder  shall be in the same
         proportion  as the number of Shares owned by that  Shareholder  on that
         Call Date bears to all Shares  owned by all  Shareholders  on that Call
         Date,  after giving  effect to any Shares to be put to MPL on that date
         under Section 2.1. Subject to these limitations each Shareholder shall,
         on the Call Date,  sell to MPL all Shares MPL desires to  purchase,  as
         specified in the Notice of Exercise.

            3.2 Price. The purchase price for each Share to be purchased  under
         Section 3.1 shall be: (a) for Shares purchased as of April 30, 1997 or
         April 30, 1998, the greater of $17.00 per Share or the per share EBITDA
         as of the Call Date, determined by dividing EBITDA as of the Call Date
         by the weighted  daily  average  number of shares  of  capital  stock
         of ADESA outstanding during the 365-day period ending on that Call
         Date, and (b) for Shares purchased as of April 30, 1999,  EBITDA as of
         the Call Date, divided by the weighted daily average number of shares
         of capital stock of ADESA  outstanding  during the  365-day  period 
         ending on that Call Date. In  determining  the weighted  daily average
         number of shares of  ADESA  capital  stock  outstanding,  the 
         outstanding  shares  of ADESA capital  stock  shall be deemed increased
         by the  number of shares of ADESA which  James  and/or  Helene  would 
         own if their than owned ADESA Canada shares were converted into ADESA

                                        3
<PAGE>
         shares at a  conversion  ratio of 9.8 ADESA  shares  for each  share of
         ADESA  Canada and such  increased  number of shares  shall be deemed to
         have been  outstanding  during the entire  365-day period ending on the
         Call Date.

         4. Closing.  The closing of any purchase and sale hereunder shall occur
at the offices of ADESA on the 60th day  following  the  applicable  Put Date or
Call  Date,  or if such day is not a business  day,  on the first  business  day
thereafter.  At the closing each Shareholder  shall deliver to MPL a certificate
for the total  number of his Shares to be sold  hereunder as of that Put Date or
Call Date, duly endorsed for transfer, and MPL shall deliver to each Shareholder
a  certified  or  cashier's  check in the amount of the  purchase  price for the
Shares.

         5.  Representations.  Each  Shareholder  represents that (a) all Shares
sold by him hereunder  will be, at the time of a closing,  free and clear of all
liens,  claims and  encumbrances  of any sort,  except as run in favor of MPL or
ADESA (b) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement does not and
will not breach, violate or conflict with any agreement order, judgment,  decree
or law to which he is or becomes a party or by which his  property is or becomes
bound.

         6. Legend on Shares Certificates.

            6.1 Legend on Currently Outstanding Certificates. In addition to any
         other  legends  required to be placed on such  certificates,  ADESA and
         each Shareholder agrees that a legend substantially as follows shall be
         conspicuously  endorsed on each certificate  evidencing Shares owned by
         the Shareholder:

                  "The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is
                  restricted by, and subject to, the provisions of a certain Put
                  and Call Agreement,  dated as of February __, 1995,  among the
                  company,  the holder hereof,  Minnesota  Power & Light Company
                  and  others.  A copy  of the  Agreement  is on file  with  the
                  Secretary of the company."

         The  Secretary of ADESA shall keep a copy of this  Agreement on file in
         ADESA's principal office.

            6.2 Legend on Certificates  Issued Subsequent Hereto. A copy of this
         Agreement  shall be filed with the Secretary of ADESA.  During the term
         of this  Agreement,  a legend  reading as above shall be  conspicuously
         endorsed on each  certificate  representing  Shares hereafter issued by
         ADESA to the Shareholder.

                                        4

         7. Right to Specific Performance.  The parties agree that the remedy at
law for  failure  of any  party to  perform  would be  inadequate,  and that the
injured  party or  parties,  at his  option,  shall have the right to compel the
specific  performance  of this  Agreement in a court of competent  jurisdiction.
This  right  shall  be in  addition  to and  not in lieu  of any  additional  or
alternative  right or  remedy  which  may be  available  to a party at law or in
equity.

         8. Miscellaneous Provisions.

            8.1  Offset  of  Shareholder  Indebtedness.  If,  at the time of the
         purchase  of Shares  hereunder,  a  Shareholder  is  indebted to MPL or
         ADESA,  MPL  shall  have the  right to  offset  any such  indebtedness,
         including  interest  thereon,  against  the  purchase  price  due  such
         Shareholder for the Shares.

            8.2 Notices.  All notices,  requests,  and other communications from
         any of the parties  hereto to another  shall be in writing and shall be

         WHEREAS,  MPL will not  undertake  the Merger unless it is assured that
after the Merger the  Shareholder  will be obligated to sell his ADESA shares to

         WHEREAS, to induce MPL to enter into the Merger Agreement  contemplated
by the Letter of Intent,  and thereafter to consummate  the Merger,  Shareholder

         upon the  occurrence  of a Triggering  Event ADESA shall  purchase from
         Shareholder, and the Shareholder shall sell to ADESA, all of the Shares
         at the purchase price specified in Section 2.2 hereof.
         
            2.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price per Share for sales occurring
         under this Section 2 shall be: (a) if the Triggering Event occurs on or
         before April 30, 1999, the

                                       2
<PAGE>

         greater of (i) $17.00,  or (ii) EBITDA  divided by the  weighted  daily
         average number of shares of ADESA's  capital stock  outstanding  during
         the 365-day period ending on the date of the Triggering  Event, and (b)
         if the Triggering Event occurs after April 30, 1999, the greater of (i)
         EBITDA  divided  by the  weighted  daily  average  number  of shares of
         ADESA's capital stock  outstanding  during the 365-day period ending on
         the date of the Triggering  Event or (ii) the fair value of the Shares,
         without  discount for  minority  interest or lack of  marketability  as
         determined  by agreement by the parties or, if the parties do not reach
         agreement within thirty days after the Triggering Event, the fair value
         of the Shares as determined by arbitration in Indianapolis, Indiana or,
         if the parties shall agree in writing, by mediation. In determining the
         weighted  daily  average  number  of  shares  of  ADESA  capital  stock
         outstanding,  the  outstanding  shares of ADESA  capital stock shall be
         deemed  increased by the number of shares of ADESA which James  Hallett
         and/or Helene Hallett would own if their then owned ADESA Canada shares
         were  converted  into ADESA shares at a  conversion  ratio of 9.8 ADESA
         shares for each  share of ADESA  Canada  and such  increased  number of
         shares  shall be deemed  to have  been  oustanding  during  the  entire
         365-day  period  ending  on  the  date  of  the  Triggering  Event.  If
         arbitration  is  used,  the  arbitration  shall be  conducted  by three
         arbitrators; one arbitrator shall be selected by each party and the two
         arbitrators shall chose an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside
         at the  arbitration.  If either  party fails to appoint its  arbitrator
         within 10 days after being  requested to do so by the other party,  the
         latter,  after 10 days'  notice of its  intention to do so, may appoint
         the second arbitrator.  If the two arbitrators are unable to agree upon
         the third arbitrator within 10 days after their appointment,  the third
         arbitrator  shall be  selected  from a list of six  individuals  (three
         named by each  arbitrator)  by a judge of the  federal  district  court
         having jurisdiction over the geographical area in which the arbitration
         is to take place,  or if the federal  court  declines to act, the state
         court  having  general   jurisdiction  in  such  area.  Promptly  after
         appointment  of all  arbitrators,  the panel  shall meet and  determine
         timely  periods for briefs,  discovery  procedures  and  schedules  for
         hearings.  The decision of any two  arbitrators  or the  mediator  when
         rendered in writing  shall be final and binding and  judgment  upon the
         award of the arbitrators or mediator may be entered in any court having
         jurisdiction  thereof.  All costs of the arbitration or mediation shall
         be allocated by the panel or the mediator.  If arbitration is used, the
         arbitration  shall, in all other  respects,  be conducted in accordance
         with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.
            
            2.3 Closing. The closing of any purchase and sale under this Section
         2 shall occur at the offices of ADESA.  The closing  shall occur on the
         later of the 30th day after (a) the

                                      3
<PAGE>

         Triggering  Event (or if such date is not a business  day,  on the next
         business day  thereafter),  or (b) not more than 10 business  days from
         the date the  mediator  or  arbitrators  render a decision in the event
         that  the  parties  fail  to  reach  agreement  as to fair  value  in a
         circumstance governed by Section 2.2(b).

         3.  Prohibition of Certain  Voluntary  Transfers.  From the date hereof
through and  including  April 30,  1999 the  Shareholder  shall not  voluntarily
Transfer any Shares to any person or entity without the prior written consent of
ADESA which consent may be withheld by ADESA in its sole discretion.

         4. Right of First Refusal in Favor of Corporation.

            4.1 Voluntary  Transfers After April 30, 1999. After April 30, 1999,
         the Shareholder shall not voluntarily Transfer any Shares to any person
         or entity  without  first giving ADESA 60 days'  written  notice of his
         intent to transfer  Shares  during which time  Shareholder  will, if so
         requested by ADESA,  enter into good faith negotiations with ADESA with
         respect  to  the  purchase  of  the  Shares  by  ADESA.  If  ADESA  and
         Shareholder  are unable,  within said  60-day  period,  to agree on the
         price and  terms  for the  purchase  of the  Shares  by  ADESA,  and if
         Shareholder is not then in default hereunder,  the Shareholder shall be
         entitled,  for a period of 90 days  following  the  expiration  of said
         60-day period, to Transfer the Shares to a Transferee.  If the Transfer
         of  the  Shares  has  not  closed  within  said  90-day   period,   the
         Shareholder's  right to Transfer the Shares free of the restriction set
         forth in this  Section  4.1  shall  expire  and the  Shares  shall  not
         thereafter be  Transferred  without again  complying  with this Section
         4.1.

            4.2 Involuntary  Transfers.  In the case of any involuntary Transfer
         of any of the Shares  (other  than a  Transfer  upon  death)  after the
         Effective Date as a consequence of an order in a divorce  proceeding or
         due to any other  consequences,  ADESA shall have the right to purchase
         such Shares in the manner set forth in this  Section  4.2.  Immediately
         upon  becoming  aware of an  involuntary  Transfer  of his  Shares  the
         Shareholder  shall  furnish  written  notice  to  ADESA.  For a  period
         expiring on the later of the 60th day after the Shareholder's notice or
         the first day on which ADESA becomes aware of an involuntary  Transfer,
         ADESA shall have the right to elect to purchase the Shares  acquired by
         the Transferee at the price specified in Section 2.2(a) if the Transfer
         occurs on or before April 30, 1999,  or the price  specified in Section
         2.2(b) if the Transfer occurs after April 30, 1999.  ADESA shall inform
         the  Shareholder  and the Transferee of its election by written notice.
         If ADESA  fails  to give  written  notice  to the  Shareholder  and the
         Transferee  within the  60-day  period,  ADESA  shall be deemed to have
         elected not to purchase the Shares, and the involuntary

                                      4
<PAGE>

         transferee shall become the owner thereof, free of the restrictions set
         forth herein.

            4.3 Closing.  The closing of any purchase under this Section 4 shall
         occur at the offices of ADESA.  A closing under Section 4.1 shall occur
         on the date agreed upon by ADESA and the  Shareholder.  A closing under
         Section  4.2 shall  occur on a date  specified  by ADESA but in no case
         later  than the 61st day  after  the  later of the date on which  ADESA
         receives notice from the Shareholder of the involuntary Transfer or the
         date on which ADESA otherwise learns of the involuntary Transfer.

         5. Representations.  The Shareholder represents that (a) at the time of
closing,  all Shares sold by him hereunder  will be free and clear of all liens,
claims  and  encumbrances  of any  sort  and (b)  the  execution,  delivery  and
performance of this Agreement does not and will not breach,  violate or conflict
with any agreement  order,  judgment,  decree or law to which he is or becomes a
party or by which his property is or becomes bound.

         6. Offset of Shareholder Indebtedness.  If, at the time of the purchase
of the Shares hereunder,  the Shareholder is indebted to ADESA, ADESA shall have
the right to offset any such indebtedness,  including interest thereon,  against
the purchase price due for the Shares.

         7. Legend on Shares Certificates.
                            
            7.1 Legend on Currently Outstanding Certificates. In addition to any
         other legends  required to be placed on such  certificates,  ADESA and
         the Shareholder  agree that the following legend shall be conspicuously
         endorsed  on  each   certificate   evidencing   Shares   owned  by  the
         Shareholder:

            "The transfer of the shares  represented by this certificate is
            restricted  by, and  subject  to, the  provisions  of a certain
            Stock  Purchase  Agreement,  dated  as of  February  ___,  1995
            between the registered holder hereof and ADESA  Corporation.  A
            copy of the  Agreement  is on file  with the  secretary  of the
            Company."

         The  Secretary of ADESA shall keep a copy of this  Agreement on file in
         ADESA's principal office.

            7.2 Legend on Certificates  Issued Subsequent Hereto. A copy of this
         Agreement  shall be filed with the Secretary of ADESA.  During the term
         of this  Agreement,  a legend  reading as above shall be  conspicuously
         endorsed on each  certificate  representing  Shares hereafter issued by
         ADESA to the Shareholder.

                                      5

         8. Right to Specific Performance.  The parties agree that the remedy at
law for  failure  of any  party to  perform  would be  inadequate,  and that the
injured  party or  parties,  at his  option,  shall have the right to compel the
specific  performance  of this  Agreement in a court of competent  jurisdiction.
This  right  shall  be in  addition  to and  not in lieu  of any  additional  or
alternative  right or  remedy  which  may be  available  to a party at law or in
equity.
        
         9. Miscellaneous Provisions.

         the next business day after receipt of electronic sent confirmation (or
         other confirmation of receipt) if telecopied,  the next business day if
         sent by a national overnight  delivery service,  or three business days

         reasonably be required of them in order to carry out the  provisions of
         this Agreement.  It is the intention of the parties that MPL be a third

         the  singular  shall  include the plural,  and words used in the plural
         shall include the singular.

                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         STOCK  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT,  made  and  entered  into as of this 23rd
day of February, 1995, by and among ADESA CORPORATION, an Indiana corporation 
(the "ADESA"), and LARRY W. WECHTER ("Shareholder").

         WHEREAS,  Minnesota Power & Light Company ("MPL"),  ADESA,  Shareholder
and others have entered into a letter  agreement  dated January 5, 1995 ("Letter
of Intent")  which  contemplates,  among other things,  that a subsidiary of MPL
will be merged  with and into ADESA (the  "Merger")  pursuant to the terms of an
Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date ("Merger Agreement"),  that ADESA will
survive the Merger and that, in connection  with the Merger,  Shareholder  will,
after the Merger, continue to own 68,388 shares of ADESA; and

         WHEREAS,  the Letter of Intent  contemplates  that the Shareholder will
agree  to sell  his  ADESA  shares  to  ADESA  upon  his  death,  disability  or
termination of employment; and

         WHEREAS,  MPL will not  undertake  the Merger unless it is assured that
after the Merger the  Shareholder  will be obligated to sell his ADESA shares to
ADESA in said circumstances; and

         WHEREAS, to induce MPL to enter into the Merger Agreement  contemplated
by the Letter of Intent,  and thereafter to consummate  the Merger,  Shareholder
and ADESA desire to enter into this Stock Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and
conditions hereof.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants and  agreements  hereinafter  set forth,  the parties  hereby agree as
follows:

         1. Definitions.  The following terms shall have the following  meanings
hereunder:

            1.1  "Shares"  shall mean all the  shares of capital  stock of ADESA
         owned by the Shareholder at the time of any Triggering Event.

            1.2   "Disability"   shall   mean  (a)  that  as  a  result  of  the

         12-month period or (b) while employed by ADESA, Shareholder is found to
         be  permanently  disabled by (i) any  insurer of ADESA  pursuant to the

         of Social  Security  disability  payments,  or (iii) by any tribunal or

            1.3 "EBITDA"  shall mean the product of (a) six and (b) the trailing

         subsidiaries  during said period (i) all interest expense  exclusive of

<PAGE>


         greater of (i) $17.00,  or (ii) EBITDA  divided by the  weighted  daily
         average number of shares of ADESA's  capital stock  outstanding  during
         the 365-day period ending on the date of the Triggering  Event, and (b)
         if the Triggering Event occurs after April 30, 1999, the greater of (i)
         EBITDA  divided  by the  weighted  daily  average  number  of shares of
         ADESA's capital stock  outstanding  during the 365-day period ending on
         the date of the Triggering  Event or (ii) the fair value of the Shares,
         without  discount for  minority  interest or lack of  marketability  as

         of the Shares as determined by arbitration in Indianapolis, Indiana or,
         if the parties shall agree in writing, by mediation. In determining the
         weighted  daily  average  number  of  Shares  of  ADESA  capital  stock
         outstanding,  the  outstanding  shares of ADESA  capital stock shall be
         deemed  increased by the number of shares of ADESA which James  Hallett
         and/or Helene Hallett would own if their then owned ADESA Canada shares
         were  converted  into ADESA shares at a  conversion  ratio of 9.8 ADESA
         shares for each  share of ADESA  Canada  and such  increased  number of
         shares  shall be deemed  to have been  outstanding  during  the  entire
         365-day  period  ending  on  the  date  of  the  Triggering  Event.  If
         arbitration  is  used,  the  arbitration  shall be  conducted  by three
         arbitrators; one arbitrator shall be selected by each party and the two
         arbitrators shall chose an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside
         at the  arbitration.  If either  party fails to appoint its  arbitrator
         within 10 days after being  requested to do so by the other party,  the
         latter,  after 10 days'  notice of its  intention to do so, may appoint
         the second arbitrator.  If the two arbitrators are unable to agree upon
         the third arbitrator within 10 days after their appointment,  the third
         arbitrator  shall be  selected  from a list of six  individuals  (three
         named by each  arbitrator)  by a judge of the  federal  district  court
         having jurisdiction over the geographical area in which the arbitration
         is to take place,  or if the federal  court  declines to act, the state
         court  having  general   jurisdiction  in  such  area.  Promptly  after
         appointment  of all  arbitrators,  the panel  shall meet and  determine
         timely  periods for briefs,  discovery  procedures  and  schedules  for
         hearings.  The decision of any two  arbitrators  or the  mediator  when
         rendered in writing  shall be final and binding and  judgment  upon the
         award of the arbitrators or mediator may be entered in any court having
         jurisdiction  thereof.  All costs of the arbitration or mediation shall
         be allocated by the panel or the mediator.  If arbitration is used, the
         arbitration  shall, in all other  respects,  be conducted in accordance
         with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.

            2.3 Closing. The closing of any purchase and sale under this Section
         2 shall occur at the offices of ADESA.  The closing  shall occur on the
         later of the 30th day after (a) the

                                       3
<PAGE>


         Triggering  Event (or if such date is not a business  day,  on the next
         business day  thereafter),  or (b) not more than 10 business  days from
         the date the  mediator  or  arbitrators  render a decision in the event
         that  the  parties  fail  to  reach  agreement  as to fair  value  in a
         circumstance governed by Section 2.2(b).

         3.  Prohibition of Certain  Voluntary  Transfers.  From the date hereof
through and  including  April 30,  1999 the  Shareholder  shall not  voluntarily
Transfer any Shares to any person or entity without the prior written consent of
ADESA which consent may be withheld by ADESA in its sole discretion.

         4. Right of First Refusal in Favor of Corporation.

            4.1 Voluntary  Transfers After April 30, 1999. After April 30, 1999,
         the Shareholder shall not voluntarily Transfer any Shares to any person
         or entity  without  first giving ADESA 60 days'  written  notice of his
         intent to transfer  Shares  during which time  Shareholder  will, if so
         requested by ADESA,  enter into good faith negotiations with ADESA with
         respect  to  the  purchase  of  the  Shares  by  ADESA.  If  ADESA  and
         Shareholder  are unable,  within said  60-day  period,  to agree on the
         price and  terms  for the  purchase  of the  Shares  by  ADESA,  and if
         Shareholder is not then in default hereunder,  the Shareholder shall be
         entitled,  for a period of 90 days  following  the  expiration  of said
         60-day period, to transfer the Shares to a Transferee.  If the Transfer
         of  the  Shares  has  not  closed  within  said  90-day   period,   the
         Shareholder's  right to transfer the Shares free of the restriction set
         forth in this  Section  4.1  shall  expire  and the  Shares  shall  not
         thereafter be Transferred without again complying with this Section 4.1

            4.2 Involuntary  Transfers.  In the case of any involuntary Transfer
         of any of the Shares  (other  than a  Transfer  upon  death)  after the
         Effective Date as a consequence of an order in a divorce  proceeding or
         due to any other  consequences,  ADESA shall have the right to purchase
         such Shares in the manner set forth in this  Section  4.2.  Immediately
         upon  becoming  aware of an  involuntary  Transfer  of his  Shares  the
         Shareholder  shall  furnish  written  notice  to  ADESA.  For a  period
         expiring on the later of the 60th day after the Shareholder's notice or
         the first day on which ADESA becomes aware of an involuntary  Transfer,
         ADESA shall have the right to elect to purchase the Shares  acquired by
         the Transferee at the price specified in Section 2.2(a) if the Transfer
         occurs on or before April 30, 1999,  or the price  specified in Section
         2.2(b) if the Transfer occurs after April 30, 1999.  ADESA shall inform
         the  Shareholder  and the Transferee of its election by written notice.
         If ADESA  fails  to give  written  notice  to the  Shareholder  and the
         Transferee  within the  60-day  period,  ADESA  shall be deemed to have
         elected not to purchase the Shares, and the involuntary

                                       4
<PAGE>


         transferee shall become the owner thereof, free of the restrictions set
         forth herein.

            4.3 Closing.  The closing of any purchase under this Section 4 shall
         occur at the offices of ADESA.  A closing under Section 4.1 shall occur
         on the date agreed upon by ADESA and the  Shareholder.  A closing under
         Section  4.2 shall  occur on a date  specified  by ADESA but in no case
         later  than the 61st day  after  the  later of the date on which  ADESA
         receives notice from the Shareholder of the involuntary Transfer or the
         date on which ADESA otherwise learns of the involuntary Transfer.

         5. Representations.  The Shareholder represents that (a) at the time of
closing,  all Shares sold by him hereunder  will be free and clear of all liens,
claims  and  encumbrances  of any  sort  and (b)  the  execution,  delivery  and
performance of this Agreement does not and will not breach,  violate or conflict
with any agreement  order,  judgment,  decree or law to which he is or becomes a
party or by which his property is or becomes bound.

         6. Offset of Shareholder Indebtedness.  If, at the time of the purchase
of the Shares hereunder,  the Shareholder is indebted to ADESA, ADESA shall have
the right to offset any such indebtedness,  including interest thereon,  against
the purchase price due for the Shares.

         7. Legend on Shares Certificates.

            7.1 Legend on Currently Outstanding Certificates. In addition to any
         other legends required to be placed on such certificates, ADESA and the
         Shareholder  agree that the  following  legend  shall be  conspicuously
         endorsed  on  each   certificate   evidencing   Shares   owned  by  the
         Shareholder:

            "The  transfer  of the shares  represented  by this  certificate  is
            restricted  by, and subject to, the  provisions  of a certain  Stock
            Purchase  Agreement,  dated  as  of  February  ,  1995  between  the
            registered  holder  hereof  and  ADESA  Corporation.  A copy  of the
            Agreement is on file with the secretary of the Company."

         The  Secretary of ADESA shall keep a copy of this  Agreement on file in
         ADESA's principal office.

            7.2 Legend on Certificates  Issued Subsequent Hereto. A copy of this
         Agreement  shall be filed with the Secretary of ADESA.  During the term
         of this  Agreement,  a legend  reading as above shall be  conspicuously
         endorsed on each  certificate  representing  Shares hereafter issued by
         ADESA to the Shareholder.

                                       5

         8. Right to Specific Performance.  The parties agree that the remedy at
law for  failure  of any  party to  perform  would be  inadequate,  and that the
injured  party or  parties,  at his  option,  shall have the right to compel the
specific  performance  of this  Agreement in a court of competent  jurisdiction.
This  right  shall  be in  addition  to and  not in lieu  of any  additional  or
alternative right or remedy which may be available to a party at law or in
equity.

         then own Shares or ADESA Canada stock,  shall have consented thereto in
         writing.

         reasonably be required of them in order to carry out the  provisions of
         this Agreement.  It is the intention of the parties that MPL be a third

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations

   Minnesota  Power has  operations  in four  business  segments:  (1)  electric
operations,  which include electric and gas services, and coal mining; (2) water
operations,   which  include  water  and  wastewater  services;  (3)  automobile
auctions,  which also include a finance  company and an auto transport  company;
and (4)  investments,  which  include  real estate  operations,  a 22.1%  equity
investment  in a  financial  guaranty  reinsurance  company,  and  a  securities
portfolio.
   Earnings  Per Share.  Earnings  per share of common  stock were $2.16 in 1995
compared  to $2.06  in 1994 and  $2.20  in  1993.  The most  significant  factor
contributing  to the higher earnings in 1995 was the recognition of tax benefits
associated with real estate  operations  which  contributed 52 cents to earnings
per  share.  Of the 52  cents  recognized,  5  cents  is  attributed  to  normal
operations in 1995.  Earnings in 1995 also reflect  increased  electric sales to
industrial customers and other power suppliers,  and the improved performance of
the Company's securities portfolio. Earnings in 1995 were reduced by lower water
sales in Florida and a 14 cent per share loss associated with exiting Reach All,
the  truck-mounted  lifting  equipment  business.  Automobile  auctions  did not
contribute to earnings per share for the six months ended Dec. 31, 1995.
   Major factors  contributing to 1994 earnings  include 42 cents per share from
the  sale of  certain  water  plant  assets  and 13  cents  per  share  from the
recognition  of escrow  funds  associated  with  real  estate  operations.  Poor
securities market conditions,  in addition to a 21 cent per share write-off of a
securities  investment  and  an 11  cent  per  share  loss  from  the  Company's
investment in Reach All,  lowered  earnings in 1994. In 1993 the  recognition of
unbilled revenue and increased sales to other power suppliers helped offset lost
electric revenue from the idling of one of the Company's large power customers.
   Discontinued  operations  include the paper and pulp business  which was sold
in June 1995.  The increase in income from discontinued  operations  reflect 
higher paper and pulp prices in 1995 and 1994. A worldwide  excess paper supply
depressed paper prices in 1993.

Consolidated Financial Review
   Operating  Revenue  and Income.  Electric  operations  operating  revenue was
higher in 1995 than 1994  because  of record kWh  sales.  There  were  increased
retail sales,  higher commercial and residential  rates, and significantly  more
sales to other  power  suppliers.  1994 was lower than 1993  because the Company
recognized $5.1 million of unbilled  revenue and recovered $14.6 million more of
coal contract termination costs in 1993. Also, National, a taconite producer and
major  electric  customer of the Company,  operated all year in 1995,  only four
months in 1994 and seven  months in 1993.  The decrease in kWh sales in 1994 was
offset by $11.1 million of additional revenue from an interim rate increase.
   Water operations  operating  revenue and income was lower in 1995 compared to
1994 due to 15,000 fewer  customers  following  the December 1994 sale of Venice
Gardens' assets. The sale resulted in a $19.1 million gain in 1994. In addition,
1994  included  12 months of  increased  rates,  while 1993  included  only four
months.  Abnormally  high  rainfall in Florida and customer  water  conservation
efforts also lowered operating revenue in 1995 and 1994.
   Automobile  auctions  operating  revenue is included as of July 1, 1995,  the
purchase date of ADESA, the automobile auction business.
   Investments  operating  revenue and income in 1995 reflects  improved results
due to the  record-setting  securities  market.  1994  includes a $10.1  million
write-off of a  securities  investment.  Operating  revenue and income from real
estate  operations  was  lower  in 1995  compared  to 1994 and 1993 due to fewer
commercial land sales and Lehigh's maturing accounts  receivable  portfolio.  In
1994 Lehigh recognized $4.5 million of escrow funds.

<PAGE>

   Operating  Expenses.  Fuel and purchased  power  expenses were higher in 1995
than 1994 because of a 13% increase in kWh sold.  Power purchases  increased $17
million  primarily  because of the increased  demand by industrial  customers in
Minnesota  and  also by  neighboring  utilities.  Expenses  were  lower  in 1994
compared to 1993 because the monthly  amortization of coal contract  termination
costs was completed in March 1994. 1994 expenses included  additional  purchased
power to provide  for  unscheduled  outages at  Boswell  and to meet  unexpected
demand from three taconite customers.
   Operations  expenses  were higher in 1995 than 1994 due to the  inclusion  of
ADESA,  scheduled electric  maintenance costs, and increased expenses related to
conservation improvement programs (CIP) and customer services.  Expenses in 1994
were  higher  than  1993  because  of  increased  expense  related  to  CIP  and
unscheduled outages at Boswell.
   Administrative  and general  expenses  were higher in 1995 than 1994 and 1993
due to the  addition  of ADESA and  salary  and  benefit  increases.  Salary and
benefit  increases were tempered by lower payroll costs associated with an early
retirement offering to electric utility employees that were age 53 or older with
10 or more years of service.
   Interest  expense was higher in 1995 than 1994 due to the  addition of ADESA.
Expense  was higher in 1994 than 1993  reflecting  debt  financing  for  capital
expenditures relating to water operations and more commercial paper outstanding.
   Income from equity investments was higher in 1995 compared to 1994 because of
increased  income from Capital Re. This increase was partially  offset by a $6.4
million loss associated with exiting Reach All in 1995. 1994 was lower than 1993
due to a $5.2 million loss at Reach All.
   Income tax expense in 1995  includes  the  recognition  of $18.4  million of 
tax  benefits  associated  with real estate operations.
   Income from  discontinued  operations  includes the operating results and the
$1.5 million net loss on the sale of the paper and pulp business.  Significantly
higher  paper and pulp prices  increased  earnings in 1995 and 1994  compared to
1993.  In June  1995 the  Company  sold the  paper  and pulp  business  for $118
million.


Electric Operations
     Electric operations  generate,  transmit,  distribute and sell electricity.
Minnesota Power provides electricity to 122,000 customers in northern Minnesota,
while the Company's  wholly owned  subsidiary,  Superior Water,  Light and Power
Company,  sells  electricity  to  14,000  customers  and  natural  gas to 11,000
customers,  and provides  water to 10,000  customers in northwestern  Wisconsin.
Another wholly owned  subsidiary,  BNI Coal, owns and operates a lignite mine in
North Dakota. Two electric generating cooperatives,  Minnkota Power Cooperative,
Inc. and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI Coal's production of lignite
coal under contracts extending to 2027.
   Electric  Retail Rates.  Effective June 1, 1995, the MPUC  authorized a final
rate increase of $19 million annually.

   Electric Sales. Kilowatt-hour sales reached a new record level in 1995 due to
warm summer  weather and increased  demand from large  industrial  customers and
other power suppliers.  The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand
services and  assistance  provided to its  customers  as well as increase  sales
beyond the Company's traditional service territory.
   The two major industries in Minnesota  Power's service territory are taconite
production,  and paper and wood  products  manufacturing.  These two  industries
contributed  about half of the Company's  electric  operating  revenue from 1993
through 1995.  Taconite mining customers accounted for 35% of electric operating
revenue  in 1995,  and 34% in 1994  and in 1993.  The  paper  and wood  products
industries  accounted for 12% of electric operating revenue in 1995, 13% in 1994
and 14% in 1993.
   Taconite is an important raw material for the steel industry and is made from
low iron content ore mined in northern Minnesota. Taconite processing plants use
large  quantities of electric  power to grind the ore and  concentrate  the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 47
million tons in 1995  compared to 43 million tons in 1994 and 41 million tons in
1993. Minnesota's taconite production in 1996 is expected to be approximately 48
million tons. An 18% increase in kWh sold to taconite  customers  contributed to
higher electric sales in 1995.
   While  taconite  production  is expected  to continue at near record  setting
levels,  the long-term  future of this cyclical  industry is less certain.  Even
with the Company's commitment to help the taconite customers remain competitive,
it is possible that production  will decline  gradually some time after the year
2005.

   Large Power  Customer  Contracts.  Electric  service  contracts with 11 large
power  industrial  customers  require  payment of minimum monthly demand charges
that cover most fixed costs  associated with having capacity  available to serve
them,  including a return on common  equity.  The demand charge is paid by these
customers even if no electrical  energy is taken.  An energy charge is also paid
to cover the variable  cost of energy  actually  used. A four-year  cancellation
notice is required  to  terminate  the  contracts.  The rates and  corresponding
revenue  associated  with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are
subject to change through the regulatory  process  governing all retail electric
rates.

Summary of Revenue and Demand Under Contract as of February 1, 1996
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Minimum Annual Revenue             Monthly Megawatts
    1996                    $100.5 million                          619
    1997                     $90.9 million                          572
    1998                     $79.0 million                          493
    1999                     $61.8 million                          388

The  Company   believes  revenue  from  these  large  power  customers  will  be
substantially in excess of the minimum contract amounts.

   These 11 large power  customers  each require 10 MW or more of power and have
contract  termination  dates ranging from April 1997 to December  2005.  Five of
these customers are taconite producers,  five are paper manufacturers and one is
a pipeline company. In addition to the minimum demand provisions,  the contracts
with the taconite  producers  require these  customers to purchase  their entire
electric service requirements from the Company. Six of the large power customers
purchase  a  combined  total  of 200 MW of  interruptible  service  pursuant  to
contract  amendments  incorporating an interruptible  rate schedule.  Under this
schedule  and pursuant to these  amendments,  the Company has the right to serve
100 MW of these customers' needs through Oct. 31, 2008, and an additional 100 MW
of these  customers'  needs through April 30, 2010. The Company has the right of
first  refusal to serve an  additional  200 MW during  these  same time  periods
following  the  termination  of any of  these  contracts.  In  total  these  six
customers will save about $12 million annually in reduced demand charges. These
savings are partially offset by the cost of  interruptible  energy being higher
than the cost of firm  energy.  The  Company is able to market the 200 MW of 
capacity to other power suppliers.
   Fuel. The cost of coal is the Company's  largest single operating  expense in
generating electricity. Coal consumption at the Company's generating stations in
1995 was 3.6  million  tons.  Minnesota  Power  currently  has two  coal  supply
agreements  in place with  Montana  suppliers  which  terminate  in May 1997 and
December 2000. Under these agreements the Company has the tonnage flexibility to
procure  between 55% and 100% of its total coal  requirements.  The Company will
use  this  flexibility  to  purchase  coal  under  spot-market  agreements  when
favorable  market  conditions  exist.  The Company  continues to explore  future
supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous
coal will be  available.  The Company has  contracts  with  Burlington  Northern
Railroad to deliver  coal from Montana and Wyoming to the  Company's  generating
facilities in Minnesota through December 2003.
   Purchased  Power  Contract.  Under an agreement  extending  through 2007 with
Square  Butte,  Minnesota  Power  purchases  71% (about 320 MW during the summer
months  and 333 MW during  the  winter  months)  of the  output of a  mine-mouth
generating unit located near Center,  North Dakota. The Square Butte unit is one
of two  lignite-fired  units at  Minnkota  Power  Cooperative's  Milton R. Young
Generating Station.
   Square Butte has the option,  upon five years advance  notice,  to reduce the
Company's  share of the unit's  output to 49%.  Minnesota  Power has the option,
though  not the  obligation,  to  continue  to  purchase  49% of the  output  at
market-based  prices  after  2007  to  the  end of the  plant's  economic  life.
Minnesota  Power must pay any Square Butte costs and expenses that have not been
paid by Square Butte when due, regardless of whether or not the Company received
any power from that unit.
   Early  Retirement Plan. In 1995 an early retirement offer was accepted by 178
of the 215 eligible electric utility employees,  representing a 12% reduction of
the electric operations  workforce.  A cost of approximately $15 million will be
amortized over 3 years consistent with regulatory precedent. The plan was funded
through excess pension plan assets.  The early  retirement  offer is part of
the Company's ongoing efforts to control costs and maintain low electric rates.
   Competition.  The competitive  landscape of the electric  utility industry is
changing at both the  wholesale and retail levels, and is affecting the way the
Company strategically views the future.
   Wholesale.  In 1995 the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on
Open Access  Non-Discriminatory  Transmission  Services by Public  Utilities and
Transmitting  Utilities and a supplemental  NOPR on Recovery of Stranded  Costs.
The purpose of the proposed rules is to facilitate  wholesale power competition,
remove undue  discrimination  in electric  transmission  and set  standards  for
recovery of stranded costs through  FERC-approved  rates for wholesale  service.
These final FERC rules are expected to be published by mid-1996.

   Regional.  The  Company  is a member of the  Mid-Continent  Area  Power  Pool
(MAPP). The MAPP power pool enhances electric service reliability,  and provides
the opportunity for members to enter into various  wholesale power  transactions
and coordinate planning of new generation and transmission facilities.  The MAPP
membership  is in the  process  of  reorganizing  to  establish  (1) a  regional
transmission group to provide comparable and efficient transmission service on a
regional  basis,  coordinate  regional  transmission  planning  and  to  resolve
transmission  service  disputes;  (2) a power and energy market for market-based
wholesale  transactions  among  interested  participants;  and (3) a  generation
reserve sharing pool to maintain and share  generation  reserves for purposes of
further  efficiencies.  The reorganization  must be approved by MAPP and will be
subject to FERC approval.
   Retail.  In 1995 the MPUC  initiated an  investigation  into  structural  and
regulatory  issues  in the  electric  utility  industry.  To make  certain  that
delivery  of  electric   service   continues  to  be  efficient   following  any
restructuring,  the MPUC adopted 15 principles to guide a deliberate and orderly
approach to developing  reasonable  restructuring  alternatives  that ensure the
fairness of a  competitive  market and protect the public  interest.  In January
1996  the  MPUC  established  a  competition  working  group  in  which  company
representatives   will  participate  to  initially  address  issues  related  to
wholesale  competition and then to consider retail  competition issues including
rate flexibility, innovative regulation, unbundling, safety and reliability.
   Customers.  Minnesota Power  anticipates  that its large power customers will
continue to aggressively  seek lower energy costs through  negotiations with the
Company and  consideration of alternative  suppliers.  With electric rates among
the lowest in the United States and with its long-term wholesale and large power
contracts in place,  Minnesota  Power believes it is well  positioned to address
competitive pressures. The Company remains opposed to retail wheeling because it
would benefit only a few large customers while potentially  adversely  impacting
smaller customers' rates and shareholder returns.
   Conservation.  Minnesota  requires electric utilities to spend 1.5% of annual
electric revenue on conservation improvement programs (CIP) each year. State law
allows utilities to recover  state-approved CIP costs through a customer billing
mechanism.  Since  January  1994 the  Company  has been  recovering  ongoing CIP
spending and $8.2 million of CIP spending from previous years. A billing 
adjustment and retail  base rates  allow the  Company to  recover both costs of
energy-saving programs and "lost margins" associated with power saved as a
result of such programs.
   The  Company's  largest  conservation  programs  are targeted at taconite and
paper  customers to promote  their  efficient  use of energy.  CIP also provides
demand-side  management  grants on a competitive  basis to commercial  and small
industrial  customers,  low-cost  financing for energy-saving  investments,  and
promotes energy conservation for all residential and commercial customers. SWL&P
also offers  electric and gas  conservation  programs to qualified  customers as
approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.
   Clean Air Act. While many utilities and their  customers will face high costs
to comply  with  clean-air  legislation,  the  Company  expects  to meet  future
requirements  without  major  spending.  By  burning  low-sulfur  fuels in units
equipped with pollution  control  equipment,  the Company's power plants already
operate at or near the sulfur dioxide  emission  limits set for the year 2000 by
the Federal  Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990.  To meet newly  proposed  nitrogen
oxide  emission  limits for 2000,  the  Company  expects  to install  new burner
technology that is currently  estimated to cost $9 to $11 million in total,  for
Boswell and Laskin.  No limits have been proposed for Hibbard.  Total  clean-air
compliance  costs cannot be accurately  estimated  yet, as  regulations  are not
final.
   1995 to 1994 Comparison.  1995 was an excellent year for electric operations.
The  Company  set new  records  for  electric  sales,  revenue  and  generation.
Operating revenue from electric  operations was higher in 1995 compared to 1994,
due to a 13% increase in total kWh sales, increased retail rates in effect since
June 1, 1995,  and  collection  of CIP  expenditures.  Warm  summer  weather and
increased  demand from large  industrial  customers  and other  power  suppliers
significantly  increased sales over 1994. Electric operations earned a return of
13.3% on average  common  equity  invested  in electric  utility  plant in 1995,
compared with 12.8% in 1994.
   1994 to 1993 Comparison.  Total electric sales increased 4% primarily because
of increased sales to large industrial customers,  wholesale customers and other
power suppliers.  Operating  revenue included $11.1 million from interim rates
collected after  March 1,  1994,  and $7.8 million  from the  recovery  of CIP 
expenses  in 1994. Operating  revenue was $12.4  million  lower in 1994  because
of reduced  demand revenue from National and lower rates associated with 
interruptible service. The Company also  completed  recovery of the remaining 
$3.9 million of coal contract buyout costs in March 1994, whereas 1993 included
$18.5 million, a full year recovery. Additionally  the  unbilled  revenue  
adjustment  added $5.1 million to revenue in 1993. Electric  operations  earned 
a return of 12.8% on average common equity invested in electric utility plant
in 1994, compared with 12.4% in 1993.

                                                                             17

Water Operations
   Water  operations  include  SSU and  Heater.  SSU  provides  water to 117,000
customers  and  wastewater  treatment  services to 53,000  customers in Florida.
Heater provides water to 26,000 customers and wastewater  treatment  services to
3,000 customers in North Carolina and South Carolina.
   Water and Wastewater Rates. Responding to a Florida Supreme Court decision
addressing the issue of retroactive ratemaking with respect to another company,
on March 5, 1996, the FPSC voted to reconsider an October 1995 order (Refund
Order) which would have required SSU to refund about $10 million, including
interest, to customers who paid more since October 1993 under uniform rates than
they would have paid under stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order, the 
collection of the $10 million from customers who paid less under uniform rates 
would not be permitted. The Refund Order was in response to the Florida First 
District Court of Appeals reversal in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order which
approved uniform rates for most of SSU's service areas in Florida. With "uniform
rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the same rates for water and
wastewater services. Uniform rates are an alternative to "stand-alone" rates
which are calculated based on the cost of serving each service area. The FPSC
will reconsider the Refund Order at an undetermined date. The Company continues
to believe that it would be improper for the FPSC to order a refund to one group
of customers without permitting recovery of a similar amount from the remaining
customers since the First District Court of Appeals affirmed the Company's total
revenue requirement for operations in Florida. No provision for refund has been
recorded.
   In June 1995 SSU filed a request with the FPSC for an $18.1 million annual
increase in water and  wastewater  treatment  rates.  On Nov. 1, 1995,  the FPSC
denied the Company's  original $12 million interim rate request for two reasons:
(1) it was based on uniform  rates which were  deemed  improper by a court order
subsequent  to the  Company's  original  filing,  and (2) the  FPSC  had not yet
formulated  a policy on allowable  investments  and expenses to be included in a
forward-looking  interim test year. The Company submitted additional information
to support interim rate approval of $12 million based on a forward-looking  test
year and $8.4 million based on a historical test year. On Jan. 4, 1996, the FPSC
permitted  the  Company  to  implement  an  interim  rate  increase  (based on a
historical  test year) of $7.9  million,  on an annualized  basis,  over revenue
previously  collected  under a uniform rate  structure.  Interim rates went into
effect on Jan. 23, 1996.  Final rates are anticipated to become effective in the
fourth quarter of 1996.
   Florida law permits  water and  wastewater  utilities to make an annual index
filing to recover  inflationary  increases in system  operations and maintenance
expenses,  thus  delaying  or  avoiding  the costs of full  rate  case  filings.
Similarly,  another  Florida law allows water and  wastewater  utilities to file
annually to recover increased purchased water and wastewater treatment costs and
property tax  increases.  Since 1993 the Company was allowed $2.9 million of the
$3 million requested in annual rate increases under these laws.

   Competition.  The responsibility of providing the fast growing populations of
Florida,  North  Carolina and South  Carolina  with an adequate  supply of clean
water  requires the constant  attention  and  foresight of the  Company's  water
operations.
   The regulated water and wastewater services industry is experiencing a series
of transformations  including privatization,  consolidation and regionalization.
These new trends are a direct result of expanded  environmental  regulation  and
increasingly limited water supply and wastewater disposal options. Consequently,
growth in the  industry  will be  realized  by those who make  adequate  capital
investment to achieve these  transformations.  Since economic regulation has not
kept pace with the investment  demands placed on private  utilities,  regulatory
lag has delayed the recovery of private utilities' service costs.
   Historically,  competition  and  change  have been  minimal in the water and
wastewater industry.  During the next five years,  however, the Company believes
that the  water  and  wastewater  industry  will  become  more  competitive  and
innovation-driven.  The Company is focused on the  application  of technology to
reduce  costs and  increase  efficiency,  objectives  that are  critical  in the
competitive pursuit of regulated, as well as unregulated, markets.
   1995 and 1994 Comparison.  Operating revenue and income from water operations
fell 24% in 1995  compared to 1994.  The decrease is  attributed to 15,000 fewer
customers  following  the sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets in December  1994 and
lower  water   consumption   due  to  abnormally   high  rainfall  and  customer
conservation  efforts.  The sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets  contributed  $19.1
million to water operations in 1994.  Customers lost in the Venice Gardens' sale
were replaced in December  1995 when the Company  purchased the assets of Orange
Osceola Utilities, Inc. for $13 million. This purchase added 17,000 customers to
the Company's Florida customer base.
   1994 and 1993 Comparison.  Operating revenue and income from water operations
increased 39% in 1994 compared to 1993 due to the $19.1 million gain  associated
with the December  1994 sale of Venice  Gardens'  assets.  1994 also included 12
months of increased rates, while 1993 included only four months. Abnormally high
rainfall in Florida and customer water conservation efforts offset the new rates
in 1994.

Automobile Auctions
   Minnesota Power has an 83% ownership interest in ADESA,  the third largest  
automobile auction  business in the United States.  ADESA,  headquartered  in 
Indianapolis, Indiana,  owns and  operates 19  automobile  auctions  in the 
United  States and Canada, through  which  used  cars and  other  vehicles  are 
sold to  franchised automobile dealers and licensed used car dealers.  Two 
wholly owned subsidiaries of ADESA, Automotive Finance Corporation (AFC) and 
ADESA Auto Transport, perform related services.  Sellers at ADESA's auctions 
include domestic and foreign auto manufacturers, car dealers, fleet/lease 
companies, banks and finance companies.
   The Company  acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995, for $167 million in cash.
Proceeds  from the sale of the paper and pulp  business  combined  with proceeds
from the sale of  securities  investments  were used to fund  this  acquisition.
Acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets associated with this acquisition
are being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over  periods not  exceeding  40
years. In January 1996 the Company provided an additional $15 million of capital
in exchange for  1,982,346  original  issue  common stock shares of ADESA.  This
capital contribution increased the Company's ownership interest in ADESA to 83%.
Put and call agreements with ADESA's four top managers  provide ADESA management
the right to sell to Minnesota Power, and Minnesota Power the right to purchase,
ADESA  management's  17% retained  ownership  interest in ADESA,  in  increments
during the years  1997,  1998 and 1999,  at a price  based on ADESA's  financial
performance.
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, 1995,  operating  revenue was $61.3 million
with no net income  contribution.  Financial  results are  attributed to auction
cancellations  because of severe weather conditions in the eastern United States
in December 1995, as well as start-up costs  associated with major  construction
projects.  First quarter 1996 financial  results will also be affected by severe
weather which continued in January 1996.
   Competition.  Within the automobile  auction  industry,  ADESA's  competition
includes  independently  owned auctions as well as major chains and associations
with auctions in  geographic  proximity to those of ADESA.  ADESA  competes with
other auctions for dealers,  financial institutions and other sellers to provide
automobiles  for  auction  at  consignment  sales  and for the  supply of rental
repurchase  vehicles from the  automobile  manufacturers  for auction at factory
sales.  The  automobile  manufacturers  often  choose  between  auctions  across
multi-state areas in distributing rental repurchase vehicles. ADESA competes for
sellers of  automobiles  by  attempting  to attract a large number of dealers to
purchase vehicles,  which ensures  competitive prices and supports the volume of
vehicles  auctioned,  and  by  providing  a full  range  of  services  including
floorplan  financing,  reconditioning  services  which prepare  automobiles  for
auction,  transporting  automobiles  to auction  and the prompt  handling of the
paperwork necessary to complete the sales.
   Auto auction  sales for the industry are predicted to rise at a rate of 6% to
8% annually.  ADESA expects to  participate  in this  industry's  growth through
acquisitions,  greenfield  start-ups and expanded  services.  In September  1995
ADESA  opened  the  world's  largest  indoor  automobile   auction  facility  in
Framingham,  Massachusetts.  Expansion  projects  at  Manville,  New  Jersey and
Jacksonville,  Florida and a  relocation  project in  Indianapolis,  Indiana are
nearing completion. These projects are expected to begin operations in the first
quarter of 1996.

Investments
   Investments include an 80% interest in Lehigh, a Florida real estate company,
a 22.1%  equity  investment  in Capital  Re, a  financial  guaranty  reinsurance
company,  and a portfolio  of  securities  managed by  Minnesota  Power which is
intended  to provide  funds for  reinvestment  and  business  acquisitions.  The
Company  ceased  operations at Reach All, the  truck-mounted  lifting  equipment
business, and sold its assets in 1995.
   Portfolio. The performance of the securities portfolio improved significantly
over 1994 earning an after-tax  return of 8.7% in 1995  compared to 1.7% in 1994
and 7.4% in 1993.  Securities  investments  totaling  $60  million  were sold to
partially fund the purchase of ADESA.  Poor market  conditions and the write-off
of a $10.1 securities  investment lowered earnings in 1994 compared to 1993. The
Company  plans to continue to  concentrate  in market  neutral  strategies  that
provide stable and acceptable  returns  without  sacrificing  needed  liquidity.
Returns will continue to be partially dependent upon general market yields.
   Reinsurance.  The Company's equity investment in Capital Re continues to be a
major  contributor to earnings.  In 1995 Capital Re contributed  $8.2 million to
earnings  compared  to $7 million in 1994 and $5.7  million in 1993.  Capital Re
earned  after-tax  returns  of 10.1% in 1995,  10.5% in 1994 and  10.1% in 1993.
Capital Re is the parent company of a group of specialty reinsurance companies.
   Real Estate Operations. Income from real estate operations was higher in 1995
than 1994 primarily due to the recognition of $18.4 million of tax benefits.  In
March  1995,  based on the  results of a project  which  analyzed  the  economic
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board
of directors of Lehigh  directed the management of Lehigh to dispose of Lehigh's
assets  in a  manner  that  would  maximize  utilization  of tax  benefits.  The
Company's portion of the tax benefits  reflected in net income is $14.7 million.
This tax  benefit  was  partially  offset  by fewer  commercial  land  sales and
Lehigh's maturing accounts  receivable  portfolio.  Earnings were higher in 1994
compared to 1993  because  the  recognition  of escrow  funds  contributed  $3.6
million in 1994.
   Lehigh currently owns 4,000 acres of land and  approximately  8,000 homesites
near Fort Myers,  Florida and 1,250  homesites in Citrus  County,  Florida. The
real estate strategy is to acquire large residential community properties at low
cost, adding value, and selling them at going market prices.
   Other.  Included  are the  financial  results  for Reach All and  charges for
general  corporate  expenses.  In 1995 Reach  All's  operating  assets were sold
resulting  in a 14 cent per share loss  compared to an 11 cent per share loss in
1994.  Pre-tax losses from Reach All were $6.4 million in 1995,  $5.2 million in
1994 and $764,000 in 1993.

                                                                             19

Liquidity and Capital Resources
   As  detailed in the  consolidated  statement  of cash flows,  cash flows from
operating  activities  were  affected by a number of factors  representative  of
normal operations.  Automobile auction operations are included since the July 1,
1995, acquisition of ADESA.
   Cash from investing  activities  included proceeds from the sale of the paper
and pulp  business  and  proceeds  from the sale of a portion of the  securities
portfolio that was used to fund the purchase of ADESA.
   Working  capital,  if and when  needed,  generally is provided by the sale of
commercial  paper.  In addition,  securities  investments  can be  liquidated to
provide funds for  reinvestment  in existing  businesses or  acquisition  of new
businesses,  and approximately 700,000 original issue shares of common stock are
available  for  issuance  through the DRIP.  Minnesota  Power's $77 million bank
lines of credit provide  liquidity for the Company's  commercial  paper program.
The amount and timing of future sales of the  Company's  securities  will depend
upon market  conditions and the specific  needs of the Company.  The Company may
from time to time sell securities to meet capital  requirements,  to provide for
the early  redemption of issues of long-term  debt and/or  preferred  stock,  to
reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.
   A substantial amount of ADESA's working capital is generated  internally from
payments made by vehicle purchasers. However, ADESA utilizes an $18 million line
of credit to meet  short-term  working  capital  requirements  arising  from the
timing of payment  obligations to vehicle sellers and the  availability of funds
from vehicle purchasers. During the sales process, ADESA does not typically take
title to vehicles.
   AFC  also  offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for  dealers  to  purchase
automobiles   at  auctions  in  exchange  for  a  security   interest  in  those
automobiles.  The  financing  is  provided  through  the earlier of the date the
dealer sells the  automobile  or a general  borrowing  term of 30-60 days.  As a
result,  AFC has a $40 million  revolving line of credit to meet its operational
requirements.
   In January  1996  SSU issued $35.1  million of 6.5%  Industrial  Development
Refunding  Revenue Bonds Series 1996 due Oct. 1, 2025. The proceeds were used to
refund  existing  industrial  development  revenue bonds totaling $33.8 million.
Also in January  1996  the Company  contributed  an  additional  $15 million of
equity to ADESA in exchange for 1,982,346  shares of ADESA original issue common
stock. As a result, the Company's  ownership interest increased from 80% to 83%.
Funds from the issuance of commercial paper were used to purchase the additional
shares. ADESA expects to use the funds to pay for capital expansion projects.
   Minnesota Power's electric utility first mortgage bonds and secured pollution
control bonds are currently rated the following investment grades: Baa1 by
Moody's Investor Services and BBB+ by Standard and Poor's.  The
disclosure of these  security  ratings is not a  recommendation  to buy, sell or
hold the Company's securities.
   In 1995 the Company paid out 94% of its per-share earnings in dividends. Over
the longer term,  Minnesota  Power's goal is to reduce dividend payout to 75% to
80% of earnings.  This is expected to be  accomplished  by  increasing  earnings
rather than reducing dividends.
   Capital Requirements.  Consolidated capital expenditures in 1995 totaled $115
million.  These expenditures  included $38 million for electric  operations,  of
which $7 million was for coal  operations,  $34 million for water operations and
$43 million for automobile  auction site relocation and development.  Internally
generated  funds and  long-term  bank  financing  was used to fund these capital
expenditures.
   Capital  expenditures  are expected to be $93 million in 1996 and total about
$325 million for 1997 through 2000.  The 1996 amount  includes $34 million for
routine  electric capital  expenditures,  $25 million for upgrades,  water reuse
projects and new water  facilities,  $28 million for automobile  auction site
relocation and development, and $6 million for coal mining  equipment  and other
capital  expenditures.  The Company expects to use internally generated funds, 
long-term bank financing and original issue equity securities to fund these 
capital expenditures.
   No new power plants or major  changes to existing  plants are expected in the
1996-2010  period.  Future water utility capital  expenditures  include facility
upgrades to meet environmental  standards and new water and wastewater treatment
facilities to accommodate  customer growth.  Capital expenditures for automobile
auctions will continue to be for auction site relocation and development.
   New Accounting Standards. In March 1995 the FASB issued SFAS 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of," effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 1995. SFAS 121 requires
that long-lived assets and intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable. SFAS 121 also requires that a utility's deferred regulatory charges
must be  probable  of  recovery  in future  rates.  The  adoption of SFAS 121 is
expected to be  immaterial to the  Company's  financial  position and results of
operations.
   In  October  1995 the FASB  issued  SFAS  123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation,"  effective for fiscal years  beginning  after Dec. 15, 1995. SFAS
123 requires companies to either record or disclose pro forma information on the
fair value of certain stock-based employee  compensation  programs.  In 1996 the
Company  anticipates  offering  stock  options  to  certain  employees  and,  in
accordance with SFAS 123, will be required either to record compensation expense
for stock options based on their fair values or provide pro forma disclosures of
net income and earnings per share reflecting this information. The Company plans
to account for its stock-based employee compensation programs in accordance with
APB 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees," and will provide the pro
forma disclosures required by SFAS 123, if material.

   In our opinion,  based upon our audits and the report of other auditors,  the
accompanying  consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements
of income,  of  retained  earnings  and of cash  flows  present  fairly,  in all
material   respects,   the  financial   position  of  Minnesota  Power  and  its
subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended  December
31, 1995, in conformity with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management;  our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial  statements of ADESA Corporation,  an
80% owned  subsidiary  acquired  July 1, 1995,  which  statements  reflect total
assets of  $355,819,000  at December 31, 1995 and total  revenues of $60,641,000
for the six month period ended December 31, 1995.  Those statements were audited
by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion
expressed  herein,  insofar  as it  relates to the  amounts  included  for ADESA
Corporation,  is based solely on the report of the other auditors.  We conducted
our audits of these  statements in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits  and the  report of other  auditors  provide a  reasonable  basis for the
opinion expressed above.

Management

   The consolidated  financial  statements and other financial  information were
prepared  by  management,   which  is  responsible   for  their   integrity  and
objectivity.  The financial  statements  have been  prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles as applied to regulated utilities and
necessarily  include some amounts that are based on informed  judgments and best
estimates of management.
   To  meet  its  responsibilities   with  respect  to  financial   information,
management  maintains  and  enforces a system of  internal  accounting  controls
designed to provide assurance,  on a cost effective basis, that transactions are
carried out in accordance with management's  authorizations  and that assets are
safeguarded  against  loss from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The  system
includes an organizational  structure which provides an appropriate  segregation
of  responsibilities,  careful  selection  and  training of  personnel,  written
policies and procedures,  and periodic reviews by the internal audit department.
In addition,  the Company has a personnel policy which requires all employees to
maintain a high standard of ethical conduct.  Management  believes the system is
effective and provides  reasonable  assurance that all transactions are properly
recorded and have been executed in accordance with  management's  authorization.
Management  modifies and improves its system of internal  accounting controls in
response to changes in business  conditions.  The Company's internal audit staff
is charged  with the  responsibility  for  determining  compliance  with Company
procedures.
   Five directors of the Company, not members of management,  serve as the Audit
Committee.  The  Board of  Directors,  through  its  Audit  Committee,  oversees
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets
regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants
to discuss  auditing and  financial  matters and to assure that each is carrying
out its responsibilities.  The internal auditors and the independent accountants
have full and free access to the Audit Committee without management present.
   Price  Waterhouse  LLP and Ernst & Young LLP,  independent  accountants,  are
engaged to express an opinion  on the  financial  statements.  Their  audits are
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and include a
review of internal  controls and test  transactions  to the extent  necessary to
allow them to report on the  fairness of the  operating  results  and  financial
condition of the Company.

2 Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
   Financial  Statement  Preparation.  Minnesota  Power  prepares its  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
principles  require management to make estimates and assumptions that (1) affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  (2) disclose  contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,  and (3) report amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
   Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial  statements include
the accounts of the Company and all of its majority owned subsidiary  companies.
All material  intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.
   Nature  of  Operations  and  Revenue   Recognition.   Minnesota  Power  is  a
diversified utility that has operations in four principal business segments.
   Electric  Operations.  Electric  service is provided to 136,000  customers in
northern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. Large industrial customers, which
include  paper mills,  Minnesota's  taconite  industry  and a pipeline  company,
purchase under contract about half of the electricity the Company generates. BNI
Coal, a subsidiary,  mines and sells lignite coal to two North Dakota mine-mouth
generating  units,  one of which is Square Butte which supplies  Minnesota Power
with 71% of its output under a long-term contract. (See Note 12.)
   Electric  rates are under  the  jurisdiction  of  various  state and  federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued  for  service  provided  but  not yet  billed.  Electric  rates  include
adjustment  clauses which bill or credit customers for fuel and purchased energy
costs above or below the base levels in rate schedules and bill retail customers
for the recovery of CIP expenditures not collected in base rates.
   During  1995,  1994 and 1993,  revenue  derived  from one major  customer was
$60.4, $60.2 and $59.6 million, respectively. Revenue derived from another major
customer was $44.9, $45.3 and $45 million, respectively.
   Water Operations.  SSU, a wholly owned subsidiary, is the largest independent
supplier of water and wastewater  utility  service in Florida.  Heater,  another
subsidiary,  provides water and wastewater  services in North Carolina and South
Carolina.  In total, 143,000 water and 56,000 wastewater treatment customers are
served.  Water  rates are under the  jurisdiction  of  various  state and county
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued for water sold but not billed.
   Automobile  Auctions.  In July 1995, the Company  purchased 80% of ADESA,  an
automobile  auction  business  that  operates in 19  locations  in the U.S.  and
Canada. As discussed in Note 3, the Company's  ownership  interest  increased to
83% in January 1996. ADESA acts as an agent in the sales process, receiving fees
from both buyers and sellers of automobiles. ADESA also provides a wide range of
related  services  such  as  floorplan  financing,  auto  reconditioning,  title
processing  and vehicle  transport.  Revenue is  recognized  when  services  are
performed.
   Investments.   The  Company's   securities   portfolio   provides  funds  for
reinvestment  and business  acquisitions.  The Company has a 22.1%  ownership in
Capital Re, a financial guaranty  reinsurance  company,  accounted for using the
equity method,  and an 80% ownership in Lehigh,  a Florida real estate business.
Real estate revenue is recognized on the accrual basis. Investment income is 
discussed in Note 7.
   Plant and  Depreciation.  Plant is  recorded at  original  cost.  The cost of
additions  to  plant  and  replacement  of  retirement  units  of  property  are
capitalized.  Maintenance  costs and replacements of minor items of property are
charged to expense as incurred.  Costs of depreciable units of plant retired are
eliminated  from the plant  accounts.  Such costs  plus  removal  expenses  less
salvage are charged to  accumulated  depreciation.  Plant  stated on the balance
sheet  includes  construction  work  in  progress  and  is  net  of  accumulated
depreciation.   Various   pollution   abatement   facilities   are  leased  from
municipalities  which have issued pollution control revenue bonds to finance the
cost  of the  facilities.  The  cost of the  facilities  and  the  related  debt
obligation,  which is guaranteed  by the Company,  has been recorded as electric
plant and long-term debt, respectively.
   Depreciation  of utility  plant is computed  using  rates based on  estimated
useful lives of the various classes of property.  Provisions for depreciation of
the average original cost of depreciable property  approximated 3.3% in 1995, 3%
in 1994 and 2.9% in 1993.  Contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) relate to
water  and  wastewater  plant  contributed  to the  Company  by  developers  and
customers. CIAC is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of
the asset to which it  relates  when  placed in  service.  Amortization  of CIAC
reduces depreciation expense.
   Fuel,  Material and Supplies.  Fuel, material and supplies are stated at the 
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method.
   Goodwill.  Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  cost  over  net  assets  of
businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years.
   Deferred  Regulatory  Charges  and  Credits.  The  Company  is subject to the
provisions  of SFAS  71,  "Accounting  for  the  Effects  of  Certain  Types  of
Regulation."  The Company  capitalizes as deferred  regulatory  charges incurred
costs  which  are  probable  of  recovery  in  future  utility  rates.  Deferred
regulatory  credits  represent  amounts  expected to be credited to customers in
rates. (See Note 4.)
   Unamortized  Expense,  Discount  and Premium on Debt.  Expense,  discount and
premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.
   Cash and Cash Equivalents.  The Company  considers all investments  purchased
with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

3 Acquisitions and Divestitures
   Acquisition of ADESA.  The Company acquired 80% of ADESA on July 1, 1995, for
$167 million in cash. The Company  accounted for the  acquisition as a purchase.
Acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets associated with this acquisition
are being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over  periods not  exceeding  40
years. In January 1996 the Company provided an additional $15 million of capital
in exchange for  1,982,346  original  issue  common stock shares of ADESA.  This
capital contribution increased the Company's ownership interest in ADESA to 83%.
Put and call agreements with ADESA's four top managers  provide ADESA management
the right to sell to Minnesota Power, and Minnesota Power the right to purchase,
ADESA  management's  17% retained  ownership  interest in ADESA,  in  increments
during the years  1997,  1998 and 1999,  at a price  based on ADESA's  financial
performance.
   The following summary presents unaudited pro forma consolidated results as if
ADESA was acquired on Jan. 1, 1994.  The pro forma  results are not  necessarily
indicative of what  actually  would have  occurred if the  acquisition  had been
completed as of the beginning of 1994,  nor are they  necessarily  indicative of
future consolidated results. The pro forma results should be read in conjunction
with the  historical  consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes of
Minnesota Power.

   Acquisition  of Orange  Osceola.  On Dec. 1, 1995, SSU acquired the operating
assets  of  Orange  Osceola  Utilities  for   approximately  $13  million.   The
acquisition adds over 17,000 water customers.
   Sale of Water Plant  Assets.  In December  1994 SSU sold all of the assets of
its Venice Gardens water and wastewater utilities to Sarasota County in Florida
(the  County) for $37.6  million.  The sale  increased  1994 net income by $11.8
million and contributed 42 cents to 1994 earnings per share. Water operations on
the  consolidated  statement of income  includes a pre-tax gain of $19.1 million
from the sale.  This sale was  negotiated in  anticipation  of an eminent domain
action by the County.
   Discontinued Operations.  On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its interest
in the paper and pulp  business  to  Consolidated  Papers,  Inc.  (CPI) for $118
million in cash,  plus CPI's  assumption of certain debt and lease  obligations.
The Company is still committed to a maximum  guaranty of $90 million to ensure a
portion of a $33.4  million  annual lease  obligation  for paper mill  equipment
under an  operating  lease  extending to 2012.  CPI has agreed to indemnify  the
Company  for any  payments  the  Company  may make as a result of the  Company's
obligation relating to this operating lease.
   The financial  results of the paper and pulp business,  including the loss on
disposition, have been accounted for as discontinued operations.

4 Regulatory Matters
   The Company  files for periodic  rate  revisions  with the  Minnesota  Public
Utilities  Commission (MPUC),  the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC),
the  Florida  Public  Service  Commission  (FPSC)  and other  state  and  county
regulatory authorities. The MPUC had regulatory authority over approximately 76%
in 1995, 77% in 1994 and 76% in 1993 of the Company's  total electric  operating
revenue.  Interim rates in Minnesota and Florida are placed into effect, subject
to refund with interest, pending a final decision by the appropriate commission.
   Electric Rate Proceedings.  In November 1994, the MPUC granted the Company an
increase in annual electric operating revenue of $19 million and an 11.6% return
on  equity.  Effective  June 1,  1995,  rates  for  large  industrial  customers
increased less than 4%, while the rate for smaller  businesses  increased  6.5%.
Rate  increases  for  residential  customers  were approved to be phased in over
three years:  13.5% began in June 1995 and 3.75% in January 1996,  another 3.75%
will begin in January 1997.
   In January 1994 the Company began  recovering  ongoing CIP  expenditures  and
$8.2  million of deferred  CIP  expenditures  incurred  prior to Dec.  31, 1993,
through a customer  billing  adjustment  and retail  base rates  approved by the
MPUC.  The  Company  collected  $10.8  million  and $7.8  million of CIP related
revenue in 1995 and 1994.
   Water Rate Proceedings. Responding to a Florida Supreme Court decision 
addressing the issue of retroactive ratemaking with respect to another company,
on March 5, 1996, the FPSC voted to reconsider an October 1995 order (Refund
Order) which would have required SSU to refund about $10 million, including 
interest, to customers who paid more since October 1993 under uniform rates than
they would have paid under stand-alone rates. Under the Refund Order, the 
collection of the $10 million from customers who paid less under uniform rates
would not be permitted. The Refund Order was in response to the Florida First
District Court of Appeals reversal in April 1995 of the 1993 FPSC order which
approved uniform rates for most of SSU's service areas in Florida. With "uniform
rates," all customers in the uniform rate areas pay the same rates for water and
wastewater services. Uniform rates are an alternative to "stand-alone" rates 
which are calculated based on the cost of serving each service area. The FPSC
will reconsider the Refund Order at an undetermined date. The Company continues
to believe that it would be improper for the FPSC to order a refund to one group
of customers without permitting recovery of a similar amount from the remaining
customers since the First District Court of Appeals affirmed the Company's total
revenue requirement for operations in Florida. No provision for refund has been 
recorded.
   In June 1995 SSU filed a request  with the FPSC for an $18.1  million  annual
increase in water and  wastewater  treatment  rates.  On Nov. 1, 1995,  the FPSC
denied the Company's  original $12 million interim rate request for two reasons:
(1) it was based on uniform  rates which were  deemed  improper by a court order
subsequent  to the  Company's  original  filing,  and (2) the  FPSC  had not yet
formulated  a policy on allowable  investments  and expenses to be included in a
forward-looking  interim test year. The Company submitted additional information
to support interim rate approval of $12 million based on a forward-looking  test
year and $8.4 million based on a historical test year. On Jan. 4, 1996, the FPSC
permitted  the  Company  to  implement  an  interim  rate  increase  (based on a
historical  test year) of $7.9  million,  on an annualized  basis,  over revenue
previously  collected  under a uniform rate  structure.  Interim rates went into
effect on Jan. 23, 1996.  Final rates are anticipated to become effective in the
fourth quarter of 1996.
   Florida law permits  water and  wastewater  utilities to make an annual index
filing to recover  inflationary  increases in system  operations and maintenance
expenses,  thus  delaying  or  avoiding  the costs of full  rate  case  filings.
Similarly,  another  Florida law allows water and  wastewater  utilities to file
annually to recover increased purchased water and wastewater treatment costs and
property tax  increases.  Since 1993 the Company was allowed $2.9 million of the
$3 million requested in annual rate increases under these laws.
   Peabody  Contract  Buyout.  In 1991 Minnesota  Power and Peabody Coal Company
agreed to terminate the 1968 Coal Supply Contract  between the parties (the Coal
Contract) two years ahead of the scheduled  termination date. As approved by the
MPUC and FERC, the Company used the retail and resale fuel adjustment clauses to
pass through to electric  customers the $35 million charge (plus a return on the
funds  used  to make  the  payment)  paid by the  Company  in  December  1991 to
terminate the Coal Contract. The consolidated income statement includes $3.9 and
$18.5  million in 1994 and 1993 of the Coal Contract  termination  costs as fuel
expense and the recovery of these costs in revenue  through the fuel  adjustment
clauses.
   Deferred Regulatory Charges and Credits. Based on current rate treatment, the
Company believes all deferred regulatory charges are probable of recovery.

5 Jointly Owned Electric Facility
   The Company owns 80% of Boswell Unit 4. While the Company operates the plant,
certain  decisions  with respect to the operations of Boswell Unit 4 are subject
to the oversight of a committee on which the Company and Wisconsin Public Power,
Inc.  SYSTEM  (WPPI),  the owner of the other 20% of Boswell  Unit 4, have equal
representation and voting rights.  Each owner must provide its own financing and
is obligated to pay its ownership share of operating  costs. The Company's share
of direct operating  expenses of Boswell Unit 4 is included in operating expense
on the consolidated statement of income. The Company's 80% share of the original
cost  included in electric  plant at Dec.  31, 1995 and 1994,  was $303 and $306
million.
The  corresponding  provisions for accumulated  depreciation  were $123 and $119
million.

6 Investment in Capital Re
   The Company  has an equity  investment  in Capital  Re, a company  engaged in
financial  guaranty  reinsurance.  During 1995 and 1994 the Company purchased an
additional  517,100  shares of Capital Re common stock for $11 million.  At Dec.
31, 1995, the Company's equity investment was 22.1%. The Company uses the equity
method to account for this investment.

7 Financial Instruments
   Securities Investments.  The majority of the Company's securities investments
are investment-grade stocks of other utility companies and are considered by the
Company to be conservative investments.
   Investments in equity and debt securities are classified in two categories on
the balance sheet:  Trading securities are those bought and held principally for
near-term sale. They are recorded at fair value as part of current assets,  with
changes in fair value during the period included in earnings. Available-for-sale
securities,  which are held for an  indefinite  period of time,  are recorded at
fair value in investments.  Changes in fair value during the period are recorded
net of tax as a separate  component of common stock equity. If the fair value of
any  available-for-sale  securities  declines  below  cost  and the  decline  is
considered  other than temporary,  the securities are written down to fair value
and the losses  charged to earnings.  Realized  gains and losses are computed on
each specific investment sold.

   Off-Balance-Sheet  Risks. In portfolio  strategies  designed to reduce market
risks,  the Company  sells common stock  securities  short and enters into short
sales of treasury futures contracts.
   Selling  common  stock  securities  short is intended to reduce  market price
risks associated with holding common stock  securities in the Company's  trading
securities  portfolio.  Transactions  involving  short sales of common stock are
completed on average within 90 days from when the transactions are entered into.
Realized  and  unrealized  gains and  losses  from short  sales of common  stock
securities are included in investment income.
   Treasury  futures  are used as a cross  hedge to reduce  interest  rate risks
associated  with  holding  fixed  dividend  preferred  stocks  included  in  the
Company's  available-for-sale  portfolio.  Changes in market  values of treasury
futures are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the underlying
hedged item. Gains and losses on treasury futures are deferred and recognized in
investment income concurrently with gains and losses arising from the underlying
hedged item. Generally,  treasury futures contracts entered into have a maturity
date of 90 days.
   The notional amounts  summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged and
are not a measure of the Company's financial exposure. The amounts exchanged are
calculated on the basis of these  notional  amounts and other terms which relate
to the change in interest rates and securities prices.  The Company  continually
evaluates  the credit  standing of  counterparties  and market  conditions  with
respect to its  off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments.  The Company does not
expect any  counterparties  to fail to meet their  obligations  or any  material
adverse impact to its financial position from these financial instruments.

   Fair Value of Financial  Instruments.  The  carrying  amount of cash and cash
equivalents,  trading securities, notes and other accounts receivable, and notes
payable  approximates  fair  value  because  of  the  short  maturity  of  those
instruments.  The Company records its trading and available-for-sale  securities
at fair  value  based on quoted  market  prices.  The fair  values for all other
financial instruments were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar

   Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial  instruments that subject the Company
to   concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  trade  and  other
receivables.  The Company  sells  electricity  to about 17 customers in northern
Minnesota's  taconite  and  paper  industries.   At  Dec.  31,  1995  and  1994,
receivables from these customers totaled $7.6 and $8.5 million. The Company does
not obtain  collateral to support utility  receivables,  but monitors the credit
standing of major customers. The Company has not incurred and does not expect to
incur  significant  credit losses.  Approximately  $73 million of trade accounts
receivable are due from automobile  dealers.  ADESA has possession of car titles
collaterallizing a significant portion of these accounts.

8 Common Stock and Retained Earnings
   The  Articles  of  Incorporation,  mortgage,  and  preferred  stock  purchase
agreements contain provisions that, under certain circumstances,  would restrict
the payment of common stock dividends. As of Dec. 31, 1995, no retained earnings
were restricted as a result of these provisions.

11 Short-Term Borrowings and Compensating Balances
   The  Company  had bank  lines of  credit,  which  make  short-term  financing
available  through  short-term  bank loans and provide  support  for  commercial
paper,  aggregating  $128 and $72 million at Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994. At Dec. 31,
1995 and 1994, the Company had issued  commercial  paper with face values of $63
and $54 million,  respectively,  with liquidity provided by bank lines of credit
and the Company's securities portfolio.  Certain lines of credit require payment
of a 1/8 of 1%  commitment  fee and others  require  maintenance  of a 5% or 10%
compensating  balance.  Interest rates on commercial  paper and borrowings under
the lines of credit range from 6.0% to 9.5% at Dec.  31, 1995,  and 5.5% to 9.5%
at Dec. 31, 1994. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings at
Dec.  31, 1995 and 1994,  was 6.1% and 5.7%.  The total  amount of  compensating
balances at Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994, was immaterial.

12 Square Butte Purchased Power Contract
   Under the terms of a 30-year  contract with Square Butte that extends through
2007,   the  Company  is  purchasing  71%  of  the  output  from  a  mine-mouth,
lignite-fired  generating  plant  capable  of  generating  up to  470  MW.  This
generating unit (Project) is located near Center,  N.D.  Reductions to about 49%
of the output are  provided  for in the  contract  and,  at the option of Square
Butte,  could begin after a five-year advance notice to the Company and continue
for the remaining  economic life of the Project.  The Company has the option but
not the obligation to continue to purchase 49% of the output after 2007.
   The Project is leased to Square Butte through Dec. 31, 2007, by certain banks
and their  affiliates  which have  beneficial  ownership in the Project.  Square
Butte has  options  to renew the lease  after  2007 for  essentially  the entire
remaining economic life of the Project.
   The Company is  obligated  to pay Square  Butte all Square  Butte's  leasing,
operating  and debt service costs (less any amounts  collected  from the sale of
power or energy to others)  that  shall not have been paid by Square  Butte when
due.  These costs  include the price of lignite  coal  purchased by Square Butte
under a cost-plus contract with BNI Coal. The Company's cost of power and energy
purchased  from Square  Butte during  1995,  1994 and 1993 was $57.6,  $55.4 and
$56.5 million,  respectively.  The leasing costs of Square Butte included in the
cost of power  delivered  to the Company  totaled  $19.3  million in 1995 and in
1994, and $19.7 million in 1993, which included approximately $11, $12 and $12.5
million,  respectively,  of interest expense. The annual fixed lease obligations
of the Company for Square Butte are $19.4  million from 1996  through  2000.  At
Dec. 31, 1995,  Square Butte had total debt  outstanding  of $207  million.  The
Company's  obligation is absolute and unconditional  whether or not any power is
actually delivered to the Company.
   The  Company's  payments to Square Butte for power and energy are approved as
purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and FERC.
   One principal reason the Company entered into the agreement with Square Butte
was to obtain a power supply for large  industrial  customers.  Present electric
service contracts with these customers require payment of minimum monthly demand
charges  that cover most of the fixed  costs  associated  with  having  capacity
available  to serve  them.  These  contracts  minimize  the  negative  impact on
earnings that could result from significant reductions in kilowatt-hour sales to
industrial  customers.  The  minimum  contract  term  for the  large  industrial
customers  is 10  years,  with a  four-year  cancellation  notice  required  for
termination  of the  contract at or beyond the end of the tenth year.  Under the
terms of existing  contracts,  the Company would collect  approximately  $100.5,
$90.9,  $79.0,  $61.8 and $48.1 million under current rate levels for firm power
during the years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, even if no power
or energy were  supplied to these  customers  after Dec. 31,  1995.  The minimum
contract  provisions are expressed in megawatts of demand,  and if rates change,
the  amounts  the  Company  would  collect  under the  contracts  will change in
proportion to the change in the demand rate.

13 Leasing Agreements
   ADESA leases auction facilities located in North Carolina,  Massachusetts and
Tennessee  from an unrelated  third party.  The term of these leases is for five
years with no renewal options.  However,  at the beginning of the fourth year of
the lease term,  ADESA has the option to  purchase  the leased  facilities  at a
collective  price of $26.5  million.  In the event ADESA does not  exercise  its
option to  purchase,  ADESA is required to  guarantee  any  deficiency  in sales
proceeds the lessor realizes in dispensing of the leased  properties  should the
selling price fall below $25.7 million. ADESA receives any excess sales proceeds
over the option price.
   ADESA has  guaranteed  the payment of principal  and interest on the lessor's
indebtedness  which consists of $25.7 million  mortgage notes, due Aug. 1, 2000.
Interest on the notes accrues at 9.82% per annum and is payable  monthly.  ADESA
had also  guaranteed  the completion of  construction  which took place at these
properties during 1995.
   The Company leases other properties and equipment in addition to those listed
above  pursuant to operating and capital lease  agreements  with terms  expiring
through 2002. Aggregate amounts of future minimum lease payments for capital and
operating  leases during each of the next five years are $6.6,  $6.5, $6.4, $9.2
and $3.4 million in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.

                                                                             33

   In 1995,  based on the  results  of a project  which  analyzed  the  economic
feasibility of realizing future tax benefits available to the Company, the board
of directors of Lehigh  directed  management to dispose of Lehigh's  assets in a
manner  that would  maximize  the  utilization  of tax  benefits.  Based on this
directive,  Lehigh  recognized $18.4 million of income by reducing the valuation
reserve which offsets  deferred tax assets.  Additional  unrealized net deferred
tax assets  resulting  from the original  purchase of Lehigh of $8.2 million are
included on the Company's  balance  sheet.  These assets are fully offset by the
deferred tax asset valuation  allowance because under the standards of SFAS 109,
"Accounting  for Income Taxes," it is currently  "more likely than not" that the
value  of  these   assets  will  not  be   realized.   Management   reviews  the
appropriateness of the valuation allowance quarterly.
   A  provision  has not been  made  for  taxes on  $19.1  million  of  pre-1993
undistributed  earnings of Capital  Re, an  investment  accounted  for under the
equity  method.  Those  earnings  have been and are  expected  to continue to be
reinvested.  The Company  estimates that $7.9 million of tax would be payable on
the pre-1993 undistributed earnings of Capital Re if the Company should sell its
investment.  The Company has recognized  the income tax impact on  undistributed
earnings of Capital Re earned since Jan. 1, 1993.

15 Pension Plans and Benefits
   Pension  Plans.  The  Company's  Minnesota,  Wisconsin  and  Florida  utility
operations have noncontributory  defined benefit pension plans covering eligible
employees.  Pension  benefits for employees in Minnesota and Wisconsin are fully
vested  after  five  years and are  based on years of  service  and the  highest
average monthly  compensation  earned during four  consecutive  years within the
last 15 years of  employment.  Employees  in Florida are fully vested after five
years of credited  service,  with benefits based on years of service and average
earnings.   Company  policy  is  to  fund  accrued   pension  costs,   including
amortization of past service costs, over 5 to 30 years. Part of the pension cost
is capitalized as a cost of plant construction.

   Company  policy  is to fund the net  periodic  postretirement  costs  and the
amortization  of the costs  deferred as the amounts are collected in rates.  The
Company is funding these benefits using Voluntary  Employee Benefit  Association
(VEBA)  trusts and an  irrevocable  grantor  trust.  The maximum tax  deductible
contributions  are made to the VEBAs.  The  remainder of the funds are placed in
the irrevocable grantor trust until the funds can be used to make tax deductible
contributions  to the VEBAs.  The funds in the irrevocable  grantor trust do not
qualify as plan  assets for  purposes  of SFAS 106  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

   For measurement purposes, it was assumed per capita health care benefit costs
would increase 12.25% in 1995 and that cost increases would thereafter  decrease
1% each  year  until  stabilizing  at 5.25% in  2002.  Accelerating  the rate of
assumed  health  care  cost  increases  by 1% each  year  would  raise  the 1995
transition  obligation by $6.8 million and service and interest costs by a total
of  $1.1  million.  The  weighted  average  discount  rate  used  in  estimating
accumulated  postretirement benefit obligations was 7.75% for 1995 and 8.25% for
1994.  The expected  long-term  rate of return on plan assets was 8.75% for 1995
and 1994.
   Postemployment Benefits. The Company provides certain postemployment benefits
to employees and their dependents  during the time period  following  employment
but  before  retirement.  On  Jan.  1,  1994,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS  112,
"Employers'  Accounting  for  Postemployment  Benefits,"  which  recognizes  the
estimated future cost of providing  postemployment  benefits on an accrual basis
over the active  service life of  employees.  Adoption of SFAS 112 resulted in a
$2.2 million transition obligation.

16 Employee Stock Plans
   Employee Stock  Ownership Plan. The Company has sponsored an ESOP since 1975,
amending it in 1989 and 1990 to establish  two leveraged  accounts.  The Company
accounts for the ESOP in  accordance  with the  American  Institute of Certified
Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position 93-6 (SOP 93-6).
   The 1989 leveraged  ESOP account covers all nonunion  Minnesota and Wisconsin
employees  who work more than 1,000 hours per year and have one year of service.
The  ESOP  used  the  proceeds  from a $16.5  million  15-year  loan at  9.125%,
guaranteed by the Company,  to purchase 633,489 shares of Minnesota Power common
stock on the open market in early 1990.  These  shares  fund  employee  benefits
totaling not less than 2% of the participants' salaries.
   The 1990 leveraged ESOP account covers Minnesota and Wisconsin  employees who
participated  in the  non-leveraged  ESOP plan prior to Aug.  4, 1989.  The ESOP
issued a $75  million  promissory  note at  10.25%  with a term not to exceed 25
years to the Company  (Employer Loan) as consideration for 2.8 million shares of
newly issued  Minnesota  Power common stock in November  1990.  These shares are
used to fund a  benefit  at least  equal  to the  value  of the  following:  (a)
dividends on shares held in participants' 1990 leveraged ESOP accounts which are
used to make loan payments, and (b) the tax savings generated from deducting all
dividends  paid on shares  currently  in the ESOP which were held by the plan on
Aug. 4, 1989.
   The  loans  will be  repaid  with  dividends  received  by the  ESOP and with
employer  contributions.  ESOP  shares  acquired  with the loans were  initially
pledged  as  collateral  for the  loans.  The  ESOP  shares  are  released  from
collateral  and  allocated  to  participants  based on the portion of total debt
service paid in the year.
