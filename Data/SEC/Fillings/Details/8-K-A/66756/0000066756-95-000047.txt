   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - (Unaudited)

1.   Basis of Presentation
     ---------------------

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for 
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and 
Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the 
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles 
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of ADESA, all adjustments 
(consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to present 
fairly the consolidated financial statements have been included. Quarterly 
results of operations are not necessarily indicative of annual results. These 
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial 
statements and footnotes thereto included in ADESA's annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 1994.

     ----------------

ADESA currently has three United States auctions which sell rental repurchase 
units under separate master contracts with General Motors (GM). These contracts 
do not require GM to sell any minimum number of vehicles through ADESA's 
auctions and may be terminated upon 30 days' notice. In 1995 GM requested that 
auctions bid for the right to sell rental repurchase units under three-year 
contracts commencing January 1, 1996. ADESA was invited in February 1995 to 
take part in this process and on May 10, 1995, submitted a bid for all of 
ADESA's United States auctions including a greenfield auction in Manville, New 
Jersey. On August 24, 1995, GM awarded contracts to seven of ADESA's auctions.

Pro Forma Condensed Financial Information (Unaudited)

On July 1, 1995, Minnesota Power & Light Company (Minnesota Power or the 
Company) acquired 80 percent of ADESA for $167 million in cash. The Company 
accounted for the acquisition as a purchase and recorded approximately $140 
million of goodwill, which will be amortized over a 40 year period. Proceeds 
from the sale of the paper and pulp business combined with proceeds from the 
sale of securities investments were used to fund the purchase of ADESA. The 
following unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 1995, combines the 
historical consolidated balance sheet of Minnesota Power and ADESA to reflect 
the July 1, 1995, acquisition as if it had occurred on June 30, 1995. The 
unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the six months ended June 
30, 1995, and for the year ended December 31, 1994, are based on the historical 
consolidated statements of income of Minnesota Power and ADESA and reflect the 
acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1 of the respective periods.

On June 30, 1995, Minnesota Power sold its investment in the paper and pulp 
business for $118 million in cash and realized a $1.5 million after-tax loss 
from the sale. Minnesota Power's financial statements as of June 30, 1995, 
reflect this transaction as discontinued operations. The historical 
consolidated statement of income of Minnesota Power for the year ended December 
31, 1994, has been restated to classify the operating results of the paper and 
pulp business as discontinued operations.

The unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the six months ended 
June 30, 1995, and for the year ended December 31, 1994, reflect exiting Reach 
All Partnership (Reach All), the truck-mounted lifting equipment manufacturing 
business immediately prior to January 1 of the respective periods.

The following pro forma financial information has been prepared from, and 
should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial 
statements and related notes thereto of Minnesota Power and ADESA. The 
following information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position 
or operating results that would have occurred had the acquisition and 
disposition transactions been consummated on the date, or at the beginning of 
the periods, for which the acquisition and disposition are being given effect 
nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial 
position.
