ITEM 7.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS


         This  Amendment No. 3 to Minnesota  Power & Light  Company's  (Company)
Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 27, 1995 is being filed to restate the
Company's  financial  data  schedule for the year ended  December 31, 1994.  The
Company's 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders  included  reclassifications on the
Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  to reflect  the way in which the
Company  currently  manages its businesses.  The Company's 1996 Annual Report to
Shareholders  reflected a  reclassification  made on the Company's  Consolidated
Statement  of Cash Flows to exclude  income  from  equity  investments  - net of
dividends received from operating activities. This Amendment No. 3 includes only
the restated financial data schedule. The following tags have been restated:
