FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September&nbsp;4, 2007, we reported that James P. Dollive, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, was retiring and that his compensation would
continue unchanged during the period prior to his retirement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are filing this Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to the Form 8-K filed on
September&nbsp;4, 2007, to report that on October&nbsp;4, 2007, our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the &#147;Committee&#148;) approved additional benefits to Mr.&nbsp;Dollive following his retirement on February&nbsp;29, 2008. We
do not typically provide additional benefits to similarly situated retiring employees. The additional benefits are consideration for Mr.&nbsp;Dollive&#146;s agreement to the following restrictive covenants until February&nbsp;28, 2009 :
(i)&nbsp;that he will not, without our prior written approval, work for, provide services, directly or indirectly, to specified competitors; and (ii)&nbsp;that he will not solicit our employees to work for another entity. On November&nbsp;19, 2007,
we executed an Agreement Upon Retirement and General Release (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) under which Mr.&nbsp;Dollive agreed to the terms of the restrictive covenants and to the additional benefits proposed by the Compensation Committee. Under the
terms of the Kraft Foods Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan of 2005, Mr.&nbsp;Dollive&#146;s unvested restricted stock awards, which were granted in 2006 and 2007, will be forfeited upon his retirement. However, if Mr.&nbsp;Dollive complies with all
of the restricted covenants in the Agreement, the forfeited restricted stock awards will be replaced with the equivalent value of deferred stock award units that vest in accordance with the vesting schedule of the forfeited restricted stock awards.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, at the October&nbsp;4, 2007, meeting, the Committee completed an initial assessment of Mr.&nbsp;Dollive&#146;s performance
for the 2007 performance year and discussed his individual performance relative to goals set at the beginning of 2007. The Committee assigned a personal performance rating of 150% of target in recognition of Mr.&nbsp;Dollive&#146;s exceptional work
in managing the financial transformation associated with our March 2007 spin-off from Altria Group, Inc. The personal rating will be applied to the business rating that will be determined later this year for purposes of calculating the payment that
will be made to Mr.&nbsp;Dollive under the Kraft Management Incentive Plan for 2007. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The forgoing description of the Agreement is

employee of Kraft Foods Inc. (&#147;Kraft&#148;) in Northfield, IL. Until recently, he served as Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Kraft and in related capacities for other affiliates of Kraft. Jim has announced his decision to
retire from Kraft. Kraft has offered Jim the benefits set forth in this Agreement. Certain of the benefits are greater than those that Jim would otherwise be entitled to receive upon his retirement. Jim has decided to accept Kraft&#146;s offer.
Therefore, Jim and Kraft both agree and promise as follows. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">1. Kraft will not require Jim to report for regular work hours at Kraft after
October&nbsp;31, 2007. However, from November&nbsp;1, 2007 through February&nbsp;29, 2008, Jim will make himself available to facilitate the transition of his duties to his successor or others and to work on any projects that Irene Rosenfeld,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kraft Foods Inc., assigns to him. During this period, Jim may arrange his work schedule so that he can pursue personal, family and career planning goals, so long as these pursuits do not interfere with
achieving a smooth transition of his duties and completing any assigned projects. Jim&#146;s last day of active employment ("Last Work Day") will be February&nbsp;29, 2008. In conjunction with Jim&#146;s retirement, effective March&nbsp;1, 2008, he
will be entitled to receive the benefits described in the following Paragraphs. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2. Kraft will pay Jim both: (1)&nbsp;a payment in lieu of
his 2008 annual incentive award payment under the Kraft Management Incentive Plan (&#147;MIP&#148;). Kraft will pro-rate this payment for the period from January&nbsp;1 through February&nbsp;29, 2008 and calculate it based on Jim&#146;s individual
target percentage. Kraft will make this payment, less required deductions, to Jim at such time in February 2008 as Kraft makes similar payments for the 2007 performance period to Kraft&#146;s senior executives; and, (2)&nbsp;pro-rata payments, at
target, under Kraft&#146;s 2007-2009 and 2008-2010 Long-Term Incentive Plans (&#147;LTIP&#148;) from the beginning of each of the performance periods through February&nbsp;29, 2008. Kraft will make this LTIP payment, less required deductions, to Jim
no later than March&nbsp;15, 2008. Jim will also be eligible for a full 2007 annual incentive award under the Kraft Management Incentive Plan (&#147;MIP&#148;) payable in February 2008. In regards to the 2007 MIP award, Kraft has assessed Jim&#146;s
individual performance for the year and, based on his exceptional work in managing the financial transformation associated with Kraft&#146;s spin-off from Altria Group, Inc., a personal rating of 150% of target will be applied to the business rating
that will be determined later this year for purposes of calculating the 2007 MIP award. The personal rating is also conditional on Jim cooperating in transitioning his role and responsibilities to his successor through year-end. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">3. As a retiree on March&nbsp;1, 2008, Jim will also be eligible for his full financial counseling allowance of $10,000 in 2008 and will have the choice
of purchasing his company car at 80% of fair market value plus all applicable taxes, license fees and any administrative fees charged by the leasing company, or returning the car to Kraft&#146;s Northfield location or another mutually agreed upon
location. </FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">4. As provided in the relevant stock award agreements, as of the close of business on Jim&#146;s Last
Work Day he will forfeit all rights and interest to any unvested shares of restricted Kraft Foods Inc. Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (&#147;Kraft Stock&#148;) awarded under such agreements. If Jim complies with Paragraphs 6, 8, 9 and 10 of this
Agreement through his Last Work Day, then on his Last Work Day, Kraft will grant Jim 38,010 in deferred stock units, each of which shall represent an unfunded, unsecured promise to deliver to Jim one share of Kraft Stock upon the terms and
conditions set forth below. Provided that Jim complies with Paragraphs 6, 8, 9 and 10 of this agreement through February&nbsp;28, 2009, Kraft shall deliver to Jim, in satisfaction of each outstanding deferred stock unit, one share of Kraft Stock as
of the &#147;vesting date&#148; for such deferred stock unit. The vesting date for 20,690 deferred stock units shall be February&nbsp;11, 2009 and the vesting date for the remaining 17,320 deferred stock units shall be February&nbsp;12, 2010. If the
foregoing conditions are satisfied, shares of Kraft Stock, net of applicable taxes shall be delivered and be freely transferable immediately following the vesting date for such deferred stock units and the deferred stock units shall be cancelled. In
addition, provided that Jim complies with Paragraphs 6, 8, 9, and 10 of this agreement through February&nbsp;28, 2009, then as and when dividends are paid with respect to shares of Kraft Stock, Kraft shall pay Jim, in cash, with respect to each
outstanding deferred stock unit, an amount equal to the dividend payable with respect to one share of Kraft Stock (&#147;dividend equivalents&#148;). The terms and conditions of the deferred stock units to be awarded pursuant to this Paragraph shall
be determined in accordance with the 2005 Performance Incentive Plan, as amended by Compensation Committee Resolution adopted October&nbsp;5, 2006. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
